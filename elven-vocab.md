# Ancient Elven Vocabulary

This document serves as a comprehensive lexicon for the Ancient Elven language, containing all root words, affixes, and relational clitics with their definitions and usage examples.

## Affixes

_Æ, A, E, I, O, U_

---

**Æ** - (suffix) enhances or intensifies the root word's meaning

**A** - (prefix) negates a root word to its opposite

> _Note: By convention, when a root word begins with a vowel, the annotation "A" becomes "An"._

**E** - (suffix) marks the modified root word as having the _potential_ for the quality, action, or state described, or as being capable of it

**I** - (suffix) makes a root word plural

**I-** - (prefix) indicates proximity ("this," "here")

**O** - (suffix) indicates a partial or lesser form of the root word

**O-** - (prefix) indicates distance ("that," "there")

**U** - (prefix) indicates a temporary or transitional state

**Examples:**

> **example: usha'i**
> `U-SHÆ-I` combines the annotations for "temporary" (U) and "plural" (I) with the root word for violence/combat `SHÆ`, creating a meaning of "temporary skirmishes" or "brief battles"—distinctly different from `SHÆ-I` alone, which would simply mean "battles" or "conflicts".

> **example: ealin**
> `E-A-LIN` combines the annotations for "potential" (E) and "negation" (A) with the root word for tree/forest (LIN), creating the nuanced meaning of "partially treeless" or "thinned forest." This differs from both `A-LIN` (meaning "treeless") and `E-LIN` (meaning "small tree"). The form `A-E-LIN` negates the "potential form"—while functionally equivalent to `LIN` alone, it can serve as a rebuttal to indicate that the forest is "not" or "no longer" lesser.

> **example: osha'**
> `O-SHÆ` combines the suffix for "lesser form" (O) with the root word for combat (SHÆ), creating a meaning of "minor violence" or "limited combat"—distinctly different from `SHÆ` alone, which would simply mean "violence" or "combat." This construction might be used to describe a skirmish or minor conflict.

## Relational Clitics

_DIV, EL, IN, IR, IS, IX, LI, NAL, SIN, TIR, VA, YE_

---

**DIV** - <follows after, proceeds from, or sequences>

**EL** - <as a person, as an individual, in the manner of> (Used to frame a concept as a statement of personal identity)

**IN** - <exists in, dwells in, or embodies>

**IR** - <owns, possesses, or holds>

**IS** - <works for, with, or on behalf of>

> **example: lini shæ vs linis shæ**
> `LIN-I-SHÆ` combines "forest" with the plural suffix (I) and "combat," meaning "forest battles" or "conflicts in forests." This contrasts with `LIN-IS-SHÆ`, which uses the relational clitic "IS" (works for/with) to mean "forest fighting alongside" or "forest alliance."

**IX** - <contrasts with, opposes, or differs from>

**LI** - <alternatively, or>

**NAL** - <moves toward, approaches, or seeks; also marks future tense when prefixed>

> **example: nal sha'i vs sin sha'i**
> `NAL-SHÆ-I` uses the particle "NAL" (moves toward) as a future tense marker with the root word for combat (SHÆ) and plural suffix (I), meaning "battles to come" or "future conflicts." Compare this with `SIN-SHÆ-I` which uses "SIN" (comes from) as a past tense marker to mean "battles that were" or "past conflicts."

**SIN** - <comes from, stems from, or begins at; also marks past tense when prefixed>

> **example: nalam vs sinam**
> `NAL-AM` combines the future tense particle with the root word for knowledge, creating "knowledge yet to be gained" or "future learning." `SIN-AM` indicates "knowledge already gained" or "past learning." These particles can create sophisticated temporal relationships when combined with other roots and particles.

**TIR** - <exchanges with, trades with, or shares between>

> **example: amtirsha' / amsinsha'**
> `AM-TIR-SHÆ` combines root words "knowledge" and "violence" with the particle "TIR" (exchanging with, trading between), creating a compound that means "knowledge exchanged through combat" or "lessons learned in battle." This implies a mutual exchange where knowledge and combat influence each other. Compare this with `AM-SIN-SHÆ` (using particle "SIN" for "originating from, sourced from"), which suggests knowledge gained from combat that can be applied beyond battle.

**VA** - <in addition to, also, and>

**YE** - <relates to, describes, or connects with>

> **example: liniyeha**
> `LIN-I-YE-HA` combines "forest" (LIN) with the plural suffix (I), the relational clitic "YE" (relates to), and "warmth" (HA), creating the meaning "forests relating to warmth" or "warm forests." The word order shows that we're talking about forests first, making them plural, and then describing their relationship to warmth.

> **example: orisam**
> "OR-IS-AM" combines the root words for "site," "focus," and "knowledge" to create "site of focused learning" or "academy." The word order indicates that it is primarily a location (OR), with a specific purpose or focus (IS), and that purpose is learning and study (AM).

> **example: galel**
> "GAL-EL" combines "area" with "person," meaning "a place for people"—that is, a city. The placement of "GAL" (area/region) before "EL" (person) emphasizes that this refers primarily to a location rather than a population.

> **example: senlelin**
> "SEN-LE-LIN" combines "sense" with "peace" and "forest" to mean "perception of forest tranquility"—describing the peaceful sensation one experiences in nature. Placing "SEN" (sense) first emphasizes the feeling itself, while "LE" (peace) and "LIN" (forest) modify it to convey the calming experience of being in natural surroundings.
