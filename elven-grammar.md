This document outlines the grammatical structure, syntax, and linguistic principles of the Ancient Elven language.

## Core Principles

**Agglutinative Language:** Ancient Elven is an agglutinative language, meaning it primarily forms complex ideas by combining smaller, distinct units of meaning (morphemes) into compound words.

**High-Context:** The language relies heavily on shared context between speakers. The subject of a sentence and other information are often implied rather than explicitly stated.

**Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) Word Order:** In a standard sentence, the subject comes first, followed by the object, with the verb concluding the phrase.

## Root Words

The Elven language consists of 200–300 essential root words—single syllables that represent broad, general concepts. These root words serve as building blocks, combining to form compound words that express precise or sophisticated ideas. In compound words, roots are arranged from least to most specific, with each subsequent root refining the meaning (though as noted in the Pronunciation section below, specific syllable stress can be used to alter a word's meaning).

> **example**
> `LIN-AD-I` is a compound word using the root words "forest, person, plural"—meaning "people of the forest" (i.e., Wood Elves). In contrast, `AD-I-LIN` combines the same root words as "person, plural, forest," which might be interpreted generously as a "tree made of people," though without further context, such a phrase would likely be understood in a disturbingly literal sense.

Through careful combinations of these roots, Elves can convey subtle tones, thoughts, and meanings. This sophisticated word-building system forms the foundation of social interaction in their language, allowing native speakers to express themselves with great precision. Due to this ability to be highly specific and leverage connotation, non-native speakers often view Elven as prone to "double-speak"—compound words may seem to mean one thing while conveying the opposite. However, this quality stems from the speaker's intent and choices rather than the grammar itself.

### Affixes

To modify a root (or stem) before its placement in a compound word, affixes are used. These are bound morphemes, often vowel sounds, that function as grammatical markers—for example, "I" indicates plurality, while "A" negates the connected root.

> **example: linadi**
> `LIN-AD-I` combines the root words for "forest" and "species" to create "Wood Elf." The "I" suffix makes it plural, forming "Wood Elves."

> **example: alin**
> `A-LIN` combines the negation prefix "A" with the root word for forest (LIN), meaning "treeless" or "deforested." This basic negation contrasts with more nuanced forms like `E-A-LIN` (partially treeless) or `U-A-LIN` (temporarily treeless), demonstrating how additional affixes modify the core meaning.

### Affix Order

Affixes modify a root word or stem based on their proximity. The closest affix applies first to create a new stem, and subsequent affixes modify that stem, forming a nested structure of meaning.

**1. Prefix Application:**
Prefixes apply from innermost to outermost—the prefix next to the root modifies it first, then subsequent prefixes modify that result.

> **example: ualin**
> `U-A-LIN` combines the temporary prefix (U) with the negation prefix (A) and the root word for forest (LIN). The negation applies first (`A-LIN` = "treeless"), then the temporary state is added (`U-A-LIN` = "temporarily treeless").

> **example: aulin**
> `A-U-LIN` reverses the prefix order, creating a different meaning. The temporary state applies first (`U-LIN` = "temporarily forested"), then negation (`A-U-LIN` = "not temporarily forested," implying permanently deforested).

**2. Suffix Application:**
Like prefixes, suffixes apply from innermost to outermost. The suffix closest to the root modifies it first, followed by subsequent suffixes.

> **example: adiæ**
> `AD-I-Æ` combines the root word for people (AD) with the plural suffix (I) and intensifier suffix (Æ). The plural applies first (`AD-I` = "peoples, i.e. different ancestries"), then the intensifier (`AD-I-Æ` = "many peoples" or "large number of ancestries").

**3. Mixed Affixes (Prefixes and Suffixes):**
When both types are present, prefixes take precedence. All prefixes apply to the root first to create a prefixed stem, then suffixes modify that entire stem.

> **example: alini**
> `A-LIN-I` combines the negation prefix (A) with the root word for forest (LIN) and plural suffix (I). The negation applies first (`A-LIN` = "treeless"), then the plural (`A-LIN-I` = "treeless areas").

### Relational Clitics

Relational clitics are small, unmodified elements that connect words and phrases to specify relationships between them, blend into word pronunciation, and cannot stand alone. For example, "YE" indicates that something describes or relates to another thing, while "IS" shows that something acts with, for, or on behalf of something else. When determining a compound word's semantic meaning, relational clitics are resolved last, in order from first to last (left to right in human writing). Since all other prefixes and compound elements are resolved first, relational clitics effectively join compound words to each other.

> **example: hiradi ye istanastra'**
> To distinguish between human groups in the East and West, one can create a phrase using "YE" between compound words for "dirt species" (humans) and "the direction light travels" (West):
> `HIR-AD-I-YE-IST-AN-AS-TRÆ`
> (dirt-species-[plural]) - [described-by] - (motion-[negate]-acting-darkness)

## Pronouns and Identity

Ancient Elven has **no dedicated root words for personal pronouns** (I, you, he/she/it). The subject is almost always implied by context. When specificity is required, a demonstrative prefix is attached to a noun:

- **I-** {this/here}, **O-** {that/there}
- **Abstract subjects:** These prefixes attach to **KOS** (concept/essence) or **FEN** (phenomenon/event)
  - `i'kos` / `i'fen`: "This concept" / "this event" (immediate matters)
  - `o'kos` / `o'fen`: "That concept" / "that event" (distant/abstract subjects)

> **Example:** A scout warning of a dragon would shout `O'fen wyr!` ("That phenomenon is a dragon!")

## Conjunctions

Conjunctions are handled by relational clitics, which are derived from conceptual root words:

- **VA** (<and>): Derived from the root VA (connection)
- **LI** (<or>): Derived from the root LI (choice)
- **IX** (<but>): Derived from the root IX (contrast/opposition)

> **Example:** `Hirad va amtreadi wyr sinsha'ex` → "The human and the high elf slew a dragon."

## Questioning and Politeness

Elven culture considers direct questions to be a rude "demand" for information.

**The Polite Method:** The standard way to solicit information is to make an indirect statement of desired outcome.

> _"It would be good to know the name of the person I meet."_

**The Direct Method:** In emergencies, military situations, or as an intentional show of force, a direct question is formed by adding the suffix **-ke** to the word being questioned.

> _A guard demanding a password might ask, "Your name-ke?"_

## Ancestral Variation

Different ancestries of Elves have developed distinct interpretations of Ancient Elven's root words (though most can be traced back to the original Ancient Elven), leading to unique cultural norms and understandings. For example, the compound word combining the root words for "still" and "air" carries different meanings across cultures—to a High Elf, it might simply describe calm weather, while an Island Elf might interpret it negatively (both literally as windless conditions that impede sailing and colloquially as a "bad omen" or "unfortunate situation"). Some ancestries have added new root words or removed others from their vocabulary. High Elven has maintained the closest similarity to Ancient Elven as of the Age of Decline, making it generally the most practical dialect to work with in terms of translation.

## Writing

In Elven writing, each root word is represented by a unique ideogram that varies by region and ancestry. These ideograms connect artistically to form compound words, with spaces separating distinct concepts. The placement and style of these connections can convey additional layers of meaning, allowing Elves to express themselves with greater artistic nuance in writing than in speech. For clarity, affixes and relational clitics appear in smaller script to aid readability, though this practice is also subject to artistic interpretation and intended meaning.

When translating Elven words into human languages, writers typically break compound words into smaller sub-words (often arbitrarily) with spaces to aid comprehension—though Elven linguists caution that this practice may subtly alter their meaning. For instance, the compound word shown above might appear as _hiradi ye istanastra'_, roughly translating to "humans of the sun's movement." Breaking compound words into sub-words is largely subjective and depends on the translator's interpretation, though convention suggests breaking at points where pronunciation could be ambiguous (as in _linas ha_ versus _linas sha_).

> _Note: In Elven script, examples appear in uppercase with hyphens connecting their morphemes—a format used for linguistic analysis. In transliterations to human writing systems, examples use spaces and capitalization to match those systems' conventions._

## Pronunciation

Elven has six vowel sounds, written in the human alphabet as `A`, `E`, `I`, `O`, `U` (all pronounced as pure vowels) and `Æ` (pronounced as the /ai/ diphthong). `Æ` is the only diphthong in most forms of Elven—adjacent vowels are pronounced separately rather than blended—and humans sometimes transliterate it as `A'`.

The language uses a limited set of consonant sounds, represented in the human alphabet as `B`, `C` (a partially voiced velar plosive, like K), `D`, `F`, `G`, `H`, `M`, `N`, `P`, `R` (an unrolled rhotic R), `S`, `SH` (a voiceless fricative, like "sh"), `T`, `V`, `W`, `X` (a voiced sibilant fricative, like Z), and `Y` (a voiced palatal approximant or consonant Y).

In compound words, stress naturally falls on the final root. Speakers can shift a word's meaning by intentionally stressing a different root word, subtly emphasizing that component's meaning.
