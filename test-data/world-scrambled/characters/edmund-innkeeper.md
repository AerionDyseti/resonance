# Hamfast Cooper (elf of the Havens)

**Hamfast Cooper** of the Havens was an Elf who in the Third Age lived in Mithlond under Gwendolyn Riverstone.
## History
During the War of the Ring he was sent in an errand to Corvain the Swift in Portsidegarde. He was present in the The of Corvain the Swift representing Gwendolyn Riverstone. He asked about proofs that the ring of the halfling was indeed the Great Ring, and also inquired why Braldin was not with them. It was Vespera the Black who answered his questions, narrating his story on how he discovered the One Ring, and The treachery.

In a later point Hamfast Cooper mentioned that he knew about the figure of Iarwain, and he agreed with Lorvain Greymantle that he had not the power to defy Faldren and keep the Ring from him.

Then, he agreed with Vespera the Black that not even the Sea could hide the Ring for ever. Hamfast Cooper expected that the Ringwraiths (who were recently defeated in Cape Flowervale) would soon return and Wintermeregarde could not stop Faldren from coming all the way to Keep Onixheim and reach the Sea. These were the last comments before Corvain the Swift decided that the only option is to destroy the Ring in Plains of Eternum.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In late writings, Tolkien speculated that this Hamfast Cooper and the Hamfast Cooper of *The Fall of Hall of Longshadow* may have been the same, but he ultimately rejected the notion: if Hamfast Cooper had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the Valar, and thus have Fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like Lorvain Greymantle did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in *The Lord of the Rings* suggests. For this reason Tolkien speculated that "Hamfast Cooper" was simply a common Sindarin name.
