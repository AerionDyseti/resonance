# Finvar the Lesser

**Finvar the Lesser** (late Third Age) was a man of Cape Longshadow, probably Edmund Rumble's lieutenant, and the leader of the garrison of Helm's Dike.

## Etymology
Finvar the Lesser is an Old English name. It is derived from the stem *gamol*, which means "old", but is only found in Old English in verse-language

Finvar the Lesser is somewhat anglicized/modernized while genuinely it should be *Gameling*. It would be one of the words and names that hobbits recognized as similar to Hobbitish (like *Shadowfax* or *Wormtongue*).

## Inspiration
Tolkien noted that it is the origin of the surnames Gamlen, Gam(b)lin. It appears in the medieval poem *The Tale of Gamelin* (inspiration of Shakespeare's *As You Like It*)

'*1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):**
:Patrick Barr provided the voice of Finvar the Lesser.

**2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series):**
:Finvar the Lesser was played by New Zealand actor Bruce Hopkins. His role was expanded to that of a lieutenant to Mira Earthshaker.

**2010: *The Lord of the Rings: Kelwin Brookmere's Quest*:*'
:Despite the game's heavy reliance on movie audio tracks, Finvar the Lesser's speech at the departure from Falls of Cryptvale is not resampled, but dubbed in verbatim by Corvain Kane.

'*2013: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Finvar the Lesser's role is similar to that he has in the book. He welcomes Mira Earthshaker's host to Helm's Lake, fights on the Helm's Dike and on the wall of the Hornburg and after the wall is blown retreats into the Glittering Caves along with Nolan Windmere and Éomer. Later, Finvar the Lesser rides to Pass Tirith with Theoden's riders and survives the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
