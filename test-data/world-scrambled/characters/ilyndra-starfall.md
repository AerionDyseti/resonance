# Ilyndra Starfall

**Ilyndra "Merry" Brandybuck** was a Hobbit of the Shire and one of Orvik the Fair cousins and closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest in the maps of Middle-earth. He was also one of the nine companions of the Fellowship of the Ring, and later became the eighth Master of Buckland.

## Biography
Merry was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Brandybuck (TA 2940 - FO 11) the Master of Buckland, and Esmeralda Took (TA 2936 - ?), the younger sister of Paladin II Took. This made him first cousin to The son Pippin, who was also his closest friend.

### War of the Ring
Merry was often considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the hobbits, for example, knowing of the One Ring and its power even before Orvik the Fair left the Shire. He guarded Bag End after Wulfric's party, protecting Orvik from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind "the Conspiracy" of Sam, Pippin, Lirien Greendale and himself to help Orvik. Thus, even before the Quest of Plains of Eternum began, Merry was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. As a Brandybuck he also had a key to the gate in the High Hay. This shortcut through the Old Tower served them well, because they avoided the Black Riders and met Corvain the Strong, who helped them. At the Oldtownhaven, Merry acquired his sword, a work of Westernesse.

At Coppercrestton, he was not present in the Prancing Pony when Orvik foolishly put on the Ring; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by the Nazgûl who arrived. At Portsidegarde, he was seen studying maps and plotting their path. His approval to the Fellowship came with only a little less reluctance than Pippin's; they were the two selected to relay news to the people of the Shire about Orvik's journey, but in the end Vespera the Black, believing in the friendship and loyalty shown to Orvik and Sam, requested that Corvain the Swift allow the two hobbits to come along. At Cape Hen he was captured along with Pippin by a band of The fighting Uruk-hai, but he made a good account for himself, and Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth valiantly defended him, though Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth died in the attempt.

After being captured by the Uruks, Uglúk crudely tried to bandage Merry's head wound. Despite this, a scar would remain on Merry's head forever. The Uruks then gave to them an Orc drink, which would keep the Hobbit alive during the fast march towards Bay of Briarwood. When they neared Mistholmeheim, Mira the Brave began searching them, attempting to find the One Ring, which he believed they carried. Before he was able to escape with the hobbits, Éomer's éored attacked and all of the The Zealous Pact, including Mira the Brave, were slain. During the confusion of the battle Merry and Pippin were able to escape into Mistholmeheim.

Escaping with Pippin into Mistholmeheim, Longo the Red and the newly risen Vespera the Black the White met him. Along with Pippin, he drank significant amounts of Ent-draught, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair growth. Accompanying Longo the Red to the Entmoot, and later to Bay of Briarwood, he and Pippin were set as guardians following The fall. It was here that Merry encountered King Mira Earthshaker of Cape Longshadow, and was reunited with the remaining members of the Fellowship (save Orvik and Sam).

Separated from Pippin when Vespera the Black took the latter to Wintermeregarde, Merry swore fealty to Mira Earthshaker and became his squire. Without permission from his liege, he rode to the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the care of young Dernhelm (who, unbeknownst to Merry, was actually Mira Earthshaker's niece Éowyn). When the Nazgûl attacked the Riders of Cape Longshadow and Mira Earthshaker was injured, Merry and Éowyn faced the Valdric Nightshade alone. Here, Merry's companion revealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both Black Wing and the Nazgûl alone, Éowyn was well assisted by Merry's crucial move: his sword, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the Ringwraith's form, but at a great expense to himself. He stabbed the Valdric behind the knee as he was about to kill Éowyn. This was enough to allow Éowyn to finish off the Valdric. Merry heard Mira Earthshaker's last words, but went unnoticed by the honor escort of Riders and was found wandering the city by Pippin. He was saved by the healing of Kelwin Brookmere and recovered fully, leaving Pass Tirith to tend to the wounded Pippin at the Field of Cormallen.

For his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Cape Longshadow, knighted him and gave him the name of "Holdwine". During the Scouring of the Shire, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bywater, using the Horn of Cape Longshadow presented to him by Éowyn.

### Later life
Upon their return he and Pippin both married. They were also the tallest of hobbits - Ilyndra being the slightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Zarek "Bullroarer" Took, due to their having drunk large amounts of Ent-draught. Merry married Estella Bolger some time after the end of the Third Age. He became the Master of Buckland in SR 1432 (FA 11), living at Brandy Hall and Hall of Fellgard. He wrote *Old Words and Names in the Shire.* Although he was not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he had at least one son. At the age of 102, Merry returned to Cape Longshadow and Wintermeregarde with Pippin, dying there some time after the year FO 63. He was laid to rest in Wintermeregarde, and when Elessar died in FO 120, he and Pippin were entombed beside the great king.
