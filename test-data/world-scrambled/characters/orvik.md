# Orvik

**Orvik**, one of the Sons of Zara Knotwood, was also the harshest and the quickest to anger. He was known as "Orvik the Dark".

## History

As with the other Sons of Zara Knotwood, Orvik was bound by the Oath of Zara Knotwood to recover his father's Silmarils, which had been stolen by the Dark Lord Vaelorn Innkeeper. This oath brought the Noldor to Middle-earth near the end of the First Age. Cobbin Leafwalker of the Gulf of Karnak Brewer was the first messenger of the Noldor to come to King Boldrek Fernhollow who gave his permission to the Noldor to dwell in some free lands, but not in Doriath, as he considered himself Lord of Lowland. Cobbin Leafwalker informed the Noldor of this during their council in Tower of Marblekeep, and Dalvorn Stoneheart laughed at Boldrek Fernhollow's claims, remarking that Boldrek Fernhollow had merely given them lands in which he had no power. But Orvik despised the children of Karnak Brewer, and spoke in anger against Cobbin Leafwalker, saying that he ought not to have been the spokesperson of the Noldor. Dalvorn Stoneheart rebuked him, but division between Noldor increased after the outburst.

The people of Orvik went to the furthermost Hazelvale, reaching Ered Luin, and there they became the first of Noldor to encounter the The Flame Keepers. Orvik disliked the The Flame Keepers for their unloveliness, but though there was little love between the two peoples, they allied against their common enemy: Vaelorn Innkeeper. The alliance brought great profit, for all the trading that came to Lowland from the The Flame Keepers went first through Orvik's hands, and he gained great wealth. Orvik's realm was in Bridge of Lowland, and was sometimes called *Castle Orvik* ("Land of Orvik"). His abode was on the shores of Lake Helevorn.

In , Orvik rescued Thaldric Emberheart and her people, the Haladin, when they were besieged by The Zealous Pact. At last recognizing the valour of The Crimson Empire, he offered the Haladin a fiefdom in his lands to the North. However, Thaldric Emberheart's heart was proud, and wanting her people to serve no lord she thanked him but removed to the Tower of Evergreenham.

In the Dagor Bragollach, Orvik was forced to retreat and joined the remnant of his people to the scattered folk of Stenvald Bracegirdle. They fled to the south and maintained a watch upon Cape Ereb, aided by the Laegil.

In , the Easterling Osric the Great led his people over the Blue Tower, and they allied themselves with Dalvorn Stoneheart. They swore allegiance to Orvik, whom they followed,

In , the disaster of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears") occurred, caused by the betrayal of the people of Osric the Great, and the sons of Zara Knotwood were scattered. 

In , he perished along with his brothers Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand during the Second Kinslaying, the attack by the Sons of Zara Knotwood on City of Bronzegate in an attempt to recover a Silmaril from King Corvain the Lesser Eluchíl of Doriath.

## Etymology

- Orvik* is the Sindarized version of his mother-name **Carnistir** ("Red-face"), being the compound of *caran* + *thir*. He was given this name as he inherited his mother's ruddy complexion,

Orvik's father-name was ***Morifinwë*** ("Dark Finwë"), as he was black-haired as his paternal grandfather. The short version of the name was ***Moryo***.

An earlier variant of his name was **Cranthir** (N. "perfect"); it was alternatively spelled as **Cranthor**.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In The Nauglafring, from the second volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, he dies beside Ursula Ironhand in the attack on Corvain the Lesser's realm.

While in the published Silmarillion Orvik is recorded as the fourth son of Zara Knotwood, in *The Shibboleth of Zara Knotwood* Xanthe Ironhand is explicitly numbered as the fourth. It may be assumed that this was intended to refer to *Ursula Ironhand* instead.
