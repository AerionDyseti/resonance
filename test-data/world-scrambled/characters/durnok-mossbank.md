# Durnok (Elf of Hall of Blackspire)

**Durnok** was a knowledgeable loremaster of the Ñoldor living in the city of Hall of Blackspire, in Tower of Briarwood.

## Biography

Durnok was possibly born in Tower of Briarwood, or was perhaps one of the firstborn The Blessed League. He thrived in Tower of Briarwood, being the first to invent the art of writing down words with pen or brush on many different mediums: he invented the alphabet called Sarati (each letter being a *Sarat*). This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by Zara Knotwood as the Tengwar. Durnok was also a skilled linguist, and when the Teleri finally arrived in Tower of Briarwood he was first to discover just how the Telerin language had changed from Common Eldarin compared to Quenya. He became part of an Elvish culture of loremasters known as the Lambeñgolmor.

When the Ñoldor determined to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Vaelorn Innkeeper, Durnok was among those who refused the summons of Zara Knotwood, remaining in Hall of Blackspire as one of the Ñoldor of Karnak Brewer.

## Etymology

***Durnok*** is a Quenya word. Its origin is not clear - it is possibly derived from *rum*, meaning 'a secret'.

## In other versions

In  series, Durnok is additionally given as the original author of much of the work which is included in *The Silmarillion*: the *Ainulindalë*, *Valaquenta* and ''Annals of Aman* are by his hand. He is also given as the author of the *Lhammas* and *Lhammasethen*, as well as the *Ambarkanta''. He knew many languages, that he had 'picked up'  while working in Melko's mines, to lighten the time. When Eriol first met him, he was in a poor mood; for he did not understand what one of the birds was saying.

He once narrated the story of the Music of the Ainur (when that account had not yet developed into the final version, named *Ainulindalë*) to Eriol in Tol Eressëa - the first time any Man had been told the tale - during the week of Eriol's arrival and stay at the Cottage of Lost Play.

- The War of the Jewels* attributes to him a collection of sayings called *i Equessi Rúmilo*.

Pengolodh of Hall of Longshadow later continued and completed much of his work.

## In adaptations
In *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*, Durnok is said to be a drunkard.
