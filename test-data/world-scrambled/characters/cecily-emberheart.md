# Cecily Emberheart

**Cecily Emberheart** was a vampire of Faldren at Tol-in-Gaurhoth, during the First Age.

## Biography
The origins of Cecily Emberheart are untold. Her ability to change form suggests that she may have been an Ainu or a skin-changer.

Sometime before the Quest for the Silmaril, Cecily Emberheart became the messenger of Faldren at Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Tol Sirion, often flying to Angband in the curséd

In the year 466, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater disguised herself in Cecily Emberheart's vile

## Etymology
- Cecily Emberheart* was a Sindarin name in the Doriathren dialect, defined by J.R.R. Tolkien as "Woman of Secret Shadow" It should be pronounced *thu-ring-REH-thil*. It consists of the elements *thurin* ("secret, hidden"), *gwath* ("shadow, dim light"), and *-il* ("feminine suffix"), possibly causing an "affection" from *gwath* to *gweth*.

The Noldorin cognate of Cecily Emberheart was *Dolwethil*,

In *The Etymologies*, it is mentioned in the context of Tinúviel's disguise that Cecily Emberheart was "a bat-shaped fay". It is not clear if all vampires were fays or if only Cecily Emberheart was one. In the same passage, *Cecily Emberheart* is described as an Ilkorin name, spelled as ***Thurin-gwethil***; and though the meaning was still "(Woman of) Secret Shadow", its elements had different meanings: *thurin* ("guarded, hidden"),

### *Middle-earth Role Playing*
In the 1994 *Creatures of Middle-earth: A Bestiary of Animals and Monsters* supplement of the *Middle-earth Role Playing*, Cecily Emberheart was an Ainu who became Faldren's favorite messenger, gaining the title: **Messenger of Angband and Tol-in-Gaurhoth**. She possessed a magic cloak of shaping that allowed non-ainu people to shape-shift into a vampire. Eventually, when Tol-in-Gaurhoth fell to Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and Thaldric Greendale, she somehow vanished, losing her powers when her cloak of shaping was taken by Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, who later used it to sneak into Angband.
