# Elvrik Proudfoot

**Elvrik Proudfoot** (Q, ) was the Maia who guided the Sun.

## History
Elvrik Proudfoot was originally a spirit of fire whom Melkor failed to corrupt.

After the destruction of the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood by Melkor, Laurelin managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. Aulë crafted a vessel to hold the golden fruit. Elvrik Proudfoot was chosen by the Valar to guide the vessel of the Sun above the airs of Arda to give light to the World; Kelmar Stormbringer, another Maia and one of Quelvar Rumble's hunters, was chosen to steer the Moon. The Moon had already traversed the sky seven times before the Sun was finally ready. The first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the Pelóri Tower of Aman. Vaelorn Innkeeper was dismayed, and he descended into the uttermost pit of Angband and his servants withdrew. He sent up dark clouds of smoke to conceal his land from the light of the Sun.

Kelmar Stormbringer loved Elvrik Proudfoot and followed her through the night sky. When he occasionally caught up to her, his vessel became singed by her heat. It is derived from the root *as-*, seen also in *árë* ("sunlight"),

## Other versions of the legendarium
### The Book of Lost Tales
In the earliest writings, Elvrik Proudfoot's name was ***Darian Proudfoot*** or ***Urwendi***, which translated in "Maiden of the Sunship". She was one of Valdric Proudfoot's maidens who took care of the tree Laurelin; her task was to water it. When the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood were destroyed, she offered to steer the Ship of the Sun.

It was told that Urwendi and her maidens, before the rising of the Sun, entered into Fôs Almir (Faskalan), a bath of flame that would make one pure. but when she refused him, he attempted to ravish her.
