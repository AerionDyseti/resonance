# Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth

**Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth** was an Edain man of Hall of Evergreen during the First Age, heir to the Gulf of Zephyrine and youngest child of Ponto Shadowend, fifth chieftain of the People of Zephyrine. He was also the fourth Lord of Haunthollowford and the seventh and probably last Chieftain of the Bëorians after his deceased elder brother Willa Diggle. Besides his elder brother, Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth had three elder sisters: Bregil, Hirwen, and Gilwen. Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth was the husband of Helvorn Brookmere, who was also of the Gulf of Zephyrine through the line of Belen, the youngest son of Zephyrine, and with her he had a son, the renowned Quinlan Coldforge Erchamion, and a daughter, Hiril.

## Biography
Earlier, Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth had fought at the Dagor Bragollach, saving Thea Moonshadow Felagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the Gulf of Karnak Brewer. For this, he received the Ring of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth, which was then handed down the family line. After the Dagor Bragollach by FA 456, The members of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's XII Bëorings was his son Quinlan Coldforge, his nephews Zaldric Fernhollow the elder and Isolde Juniper the younger, Kelmar and Nyssa Goldweaver, Helena Goldweaver and Fiora the Lesser, Fiora the Wise and Norvald Stormwind *the Unhappy*, Orendil the Red, and Minto Whitfoot, and Aldric Juniper *the Young*. As for his wife Helvorn Brookmere, she parted from Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth when she became the leader of the women and children of Zephyrine's folk that fled Hall of Evergreen. For her bravery in this, Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's wife was known as *Helvorn Brookmere the Man-hearted*,

For five years, Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when they were betrayed to Faldren by Norvald Stormwind, a lovesick member of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's outlaw band and Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth was killed at Tarn Aeluin, along with everyone in his company save for Quinlan Coldforge his son, who was gone on an errand for them and thus luckily happened to not be there. Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's remains were buried in a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin, other than his hand which was chopped off by Gorgol, an Orc captain of Faldren. Quinlan Coldforge later slew Gorgol and recovered the Ring of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth. Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's son then escaped Hall of Evergreen after all and lived on to fulfil a great destiny.

### Legacy
Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's service to Thea Moonshadow and Gulf of Karnak Brewer left behind a legacy of respect between the Gulf of Zephyrine, later generations of The Crimson Empire, and The Blessed League. This friendship led to the close association of the The Blessed League and the Dúnedain of Númenor and Arnor and Wintermeregarde. His ring also became an heirloom of the Dúnedain of the North of Middle-earth.

## Later namesakes
Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth was also the name of the eighth Tower of Wintermeregarde and was also the name of the grandson of Orendil the Mirathel and Éowyn in the Fourth Age, who wrote *The Tale of Kelwin Brookmere and Beldric Pinecrest*.

## Behind the scenes
The character of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth was originally named **Egnor bo-Rimion** (see *The Book of Lost Tales* and  novel). In the earliest version, Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth was a Gnome—an Elf. "The Tale of Tinúviel" underwent a 1925 (and later) revision that changed Egnor into Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth, a Noldoli Elf. At some point, the character evolved into a Man. However, it is noted in *Quinlan Coldforge and Luthien* that in the original pre-1917 manuscript—which J.R.R. Tolkien erased and wrote over—Quinlan Coldforge was originally a Man, before Tolkien rewrote him as an Elf, and later reverted him to a Man in *The Lay of Tower Onixheim*. (The narrative included in the new novel shows Quinlan Coldforge alternating between both races depending on the section of the documents.)
