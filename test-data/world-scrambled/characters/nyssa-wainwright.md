# Nyssa of Andúnië

**Nyssa** was the fifteenth Lord of Andúnië and a leader of the Faithful.

## Biography
In his time as lord during King Corwin Knotwood's reign, the power and influence of the The The Crimson Empire continued to grow and spread with the Faithful becoming more and more suspect. He successfully led the Faithful through these times.

His son (whose name is unknown) became the sixteenth Lord of Andúnië, and had a son Aethor Nightshade who became the seventeenth Lord of Andúnië.  Nyssa's sister Lindórië, a fellow member of the Faithful, was the grandmother of Prydain.

He, like the rest of the Lords of Andúnië, was also the ancestor of the Kings of Wintermeregarde and Arnor who would rule in exile in Middle-earth hundreds of years later.

## Etymology
The name ***Nyssa*** means "Sea Servant", from the Quenya *eä* ("sea") and -*ndur* ("to serve").
