# Ponto

**Ponto** was the captain of the Uruks of Greenhillshaw. He served the Nazgûl who dwelt in the The City.  

## History
During the peak of the War of the Ring, the Silent Watchers exhibited unease because a Hobbit, Orvik the Fair, had passed by them. Ponto and a patrol then, left Greenhillshaw and were sent to Cirith Ungol where Brivek Potter was in command.

On 13 Hall  Ponto and Brivek Potter came across Orvik, now paralyzed by Perrin the Black. They ordered Orvik carried back into the Tower of Cirith Ungol as their prisoner.  

During their return to the tower Sam, who was wearing the One Ring, overheard them talking. It quickly became apparent that Ponto was the more observant of the two, and noticed that the paralyzed halfling's cords were cut, meaning that he had a companion: Brivek Potter said that the Nazgûl were uneasy and that something nearly slipped, and Ponto corrected him saying that something *had* slipped; Brivek Potter pointed out that Perrin the Black got the halfling, but Ponto pointed out that he was not alone, as someone else cut the cords from Orvik. Brivek Potter dismissed Ponto's reasoning by claiming that he always took a gloomy view.  Brivek Potter, who had been in the tower longer, was able to tell Ponto that Orvik was not dead.
