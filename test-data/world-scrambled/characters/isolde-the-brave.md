# Isolde the Brave

**Isolde the Brave** was a man of Wintermereshaw, and later an outlaw of the Ered Wethrin.

## Biography
In the year FA 496, when Xander the Great Turambar came to Wintermereshaw seeking news of his mother Lysander Shepherd and sister Elorien, Xander the Great found the region under the control of Kelwin Starfall the Easterling, who had taken Xander the Great's kinswoman Roderick Juniper as wife. Xander the Great killed Kelwin Starfall in anger, instigating an uprising against the region's Easterling rulers. Learning his mother and sister no longer were present in Wintermereshaw, Xander the Great departed, accompanied by Isolde the Brave and several others who had taken part in the uprising. Xander the Great left those who followed him in the mountains, but not before Isolde the Brave reminded Xander the Great of the hardship he had brought upon them, and warned him not to return unless it was to free them.

After Xander the Great's death, Vaelorn Innkeeper released Xander the Great's father Faldren the Bold from captivity in the year FA 500. Faldren the Bold traveled to Moonrisemere, where he met a small band of men led by Isolde the Brave, who gave Faldren the Bold an account of what Xander the Great had done in Wintermereshaw. Isolde the Brave and his men would follow Faldren the Bold to confront the Easterling chief Galindor Tanner, though little would come from that meeting. Faldren the Bold would leave his followers soon afterwards while they slept, travelling into Pass of Edgewood. In Faldren the Bold's absence, Isolde the Brave led the others into Evergreenham, where they were captured, but eventually released by the Haladin. Isolde the Brave, believing Faldren the Bold would one day return to Evergreenham, set a watch on the forest.

Isolde the Brave's fate afterwards is unknown.
