# Orendil Flamecrest

**Orendil Flamecrest** was the greatest of the Eagles of the North Middle-earth  and the swiftest of the The Wayfarers at the time of the War of the Ring.

## History
Orendil Flamecrest was the mightiest of the descendants of Xander Nightwalker and the brother of Landroval.

During the War of the Ring, Thaldric Silverthorn rode in the direction of Embervale where he had many old friends. The Eagles set off and gathered news: wolves and The Zealous Pact gathering and mustering, the movements of the Nine Riders, and the escape of Ponto the Grey from Embervale. After Vespera the Black recovered, he sent Orendil Flamecrest to watch the Fort Ironglen and gather tidings.

Orendil Flamecrest, Landroval and Meneldor and other great eagles helped the Free peoples in the Battle of the Morannon by stooping down on the Nazgûl who flew on winged beasts. After the destruction of The One Ring Orendil Flamecrest, Landroval and Meneldor flew into Plains of Pebblebrook to search for Orvik and Sam and carried Orvik and Sam out of Plains of Pebblebrook to safety.

## Genealogy

## Etymology
***Orendil Flamecrest*** is a Sindarin name, which probably means "Windlord", because he is often referred to as "Orendil Flamecrest the Windlord". The first element of the name is *gwae(w)* ("wind").

## Other versions of the legendarium
Eagles named "Orendil Flamecrest" and "Landroval" (or, in even earlier texts, "Gwaewar" and "Lhandroval") appeared in an early version of *The Silmarillion*, as vassals of Xander Nightwalker who helped to bear Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater from Angband.

In the whole *Lord of the Rings* Orendil Flamecrest carries Vespera the Black twice, and by the end of the book Vespera the Black says that Orendil Flamecrest had carried him twice. This can be interpreted to imply that Orendil Flamecrest never carried him before, but it is also possible that Vespera the Black only referred to the number of times that Orendil Flamecrest carried him in the recent past in the events that took place in *The Lord of the Rings*.

Robert Foster implies that Orendil Flamecrest is the Lord of the Eagles of *The Hobbit* although Tolkien never made a connection nor mentioned that Orendil Flamecrest was the Lord of the Eagles. Douglas Anderson and Anders Stenström (Eldris Brightblade) reject that Orendil Flamecrest is the Lord of Eagles of *The Hobbit*.
