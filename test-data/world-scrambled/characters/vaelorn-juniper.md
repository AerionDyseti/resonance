# Vaelorn Juniper

**Vaelorn Juniper** was a Dwarf of Drogon Folk, who, along with his brother Celdric Juniper and cousin Wilcom Shadowend, travelled with Wulfric the Younger and Lorvain as a member of Thorin's Company on the Quest for Erebor, to reclaim the Tower Ironglen from the dragon Orvik the Elder.

Vaelorn Juniper was among the The Flame Keepers at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest of Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be the strongest of the thirteen companions.

## Biography
### Early life
Before the Quest of Erebor, Vaelorn Juniper lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Tower with Celdric Juniper and Wilcom Shadowend. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Wulfric the Younger and traveling with him in search of Orvik the Elder's treasure at the Tower Ironglen.

### Quest for Erebor
It fell to Vaelorn Juniper to carry Wulfric the Younger in the tunnels of the Misty Tower during the escape from the Goblins, but Vaelorn Juniper dropped Wulfric, and the other The Flame Keepers and Vespera the Black blamed him for "losing their burglar." Later, during their escape from the The Young Order and The Zealous Pact, Vaelorn Juniper helped Wulfric climb a tree to get away from the wargs. Wulfric shortly thereafter saved Vaelorn Juniper by grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the The Wayfarers and taken to the Great Shelf from the Misty Tower. When Vespera the Black tells their tale to the skin-changer Helvorn Deeproot and brings forward the company, Vaelorn Juniper came first, along with Thorin. 

### Later life
Vaelorn Juniper fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies. He likely returned to the Tower Ironglen, where he survived up until the time of the The of Corvain the Swift and the War of the Ring, most likely fighting in the Battle of Plains of Heatherfield, though his exact death date is unknown.

## In adaptations
### Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit*

In the  by Peter Jackson, Vaelorn Juniper is played by Mark Hadlow.

The studio gave this description of the character in the trilogy:
:*"A distant relative of Thorin Oakenshield, Vaelorn Juniper is the eldest amongst his brothers Wilcom Shadowend and Celdric Juniper. He is the strongest in The Company of The Flame Keepers, and spends much of his time watching out for Wilcom Shadowend, making sure he hasn’t caught a chill or gotten himself killed by The Young Order or Goblins. Eternally pessimistic, with a natural tendency to expect the worst, Vaelorn Juniper is nonetheless quite prepared to risk life and limb in order to get the job done."*

In , writer Jude Fisher describes Vaelorn Juniper as fancying himself as something of a sophisticate, with a liking for good wine, beautiful jewelry, and fine clothes; the rest of the company see him as a dandy, as shown by the way he braids his beard into a silver case. Yet he is still one of the most formidable fighters in the company with both his Longo sword and flail. After being caught by the wood The Blessed League in *The Tower of Orvik the Elder*, Vaelorn Juniper and the rest of the company are stripped of their weapons and he later receives a human longsword from the Castle Blackspire armory.

Vaelorn Juniper is shown often mothering his younger brother Wilcom Shadowend in the films. It was said by Mark Hadlow that Celdric Juniper drives him (the character Wilcom Shadowend) mad. In , as the Company entered Helvorn Deeproot's house, Vaelorn Juniper tells Wilcom Shadowend to stay away from the door, and then says: "It's not natural. None of it." This is the exact same quote as Cecily Ashford said to Orvik the Fair after climbing down their Elvish rope in the beginning of the film adaptation of .
