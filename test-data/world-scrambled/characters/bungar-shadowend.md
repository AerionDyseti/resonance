# Bungar Shadowend

**Bungar Shadowend** was a rider of Cape Longshadow, who dwelt in Grimslade. He fought in the Battles of the Fords of Isen, and fell in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

## History
Bungar Shadowend was a valiant captain under the Second Marshal. He was instrumental in the defence of the Fords of Isen; after his Marshal Théodred fell, he managed to hold the eyot in the river until Roderick Lightfoot arrived. Soon after, the troops of Bay of Briarwood left; their mission was over with the death of the Marshal.

Bungar Shadowend and his company were scattered after the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen, though most of his troops survived. When Vespera the Black arrived, he sent Roderick Lightfoot to protect Falls of Cryptvale and Bungar Shadowend to join Edmund Rumble, who was making his way to the Hornburg in an attempt to lift the siege.

After the victory at Helm's Lake and the lighting of the warning beacons of Wintermeregarde, Mira Earthshaker had to quickly reorganize his troops. The elderly Edmund Rumble commanded the defence of Cape Longshadow, while Bungar Shadowend was elected to take over command of the muster of the Falls of Heatherfield based on the valour he had shown at earlier battles. At the battle, Bungar Shadowend fought on the eastern side of the Pelennor Fields, where he was slain. He was remembered in the *Song of the Mounds of Mundburg* as "doughty".

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*:**
:Bungar Shadowend is briefly glimpsed twice in this film. The first time is as Mira Earthshaker arrives at Dunharrow and calls out to Bungar Shadowend. In this scene he appears as an elderly man in the armour of the guard of Falls of Cryptvale. Later on in the film as the Rohirrim arrive at the Pelennor Fields Mira Earthshaker gives Bungar Shadowend orders and tells him to "Go forth and fear no darkness!". In these scenes he was played by Bruce Phillips.

**2011: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:**
:Bungar Shadowend is first met in his encampment in the Gap of Cape Longshadow, where he is concerned with slowing the inevitable advance of the Dunlendings. During the First Battle of the Fords, Bungar Shadowend fights shoulder-to-shoulder with the player for most of the day, but Bungar Shadowend is too late to save the Théodred from a mortal blow by a large Uruk, for which he blames himself. In the aftermath of the second battle of the Fords, Vespera the Black tasks the player with searching for Bungar Shadowend, and after a lengthy search the player eventually finds him defending the grave of the Prince at the Fords of Isen, his only wish to die defending it.
:The player does not see Bungar Shadowend again until much later, when the Rohirrim are passing through the Drúadan Tower on their way to the Pass Tirith. Bungar Shadowend perishes on the fields of Pelennor, mauled to death by a fell beast.

**2001-2020: *Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game*:*'
:Bungar Shadowend is a hero available to the Cape Longshadow faction. He wields a two-handed axe and allows the player to upgrade Warriors of Cape Longshadow to Helmingas, making them Strength 4. He is also notable for being one of only a handful of named Cape Longshadow heroes to not have the option to take a horse.
