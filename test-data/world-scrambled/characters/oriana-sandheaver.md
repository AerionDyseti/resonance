# Oriana Sandheaver

**Oriana Sandheaver** was an Edain woman of the Gulf of Zephyrine; the wife of Tobias Puddifoot and mother of Brivek the Golden.

## Biography
Oriana Sandheaver was the daughter of Isolde Juniper and the cousin of Lysander Shepherd and was born around 450 of the First Age in probably in Haunthollowford, Hall of Evergreen. Oriana Sandheaver was a gentle hearted woman and was a lover of nature, especially trees and flowers, and loved neither hunting nor war. She was also a singer and composed songs. She was only a young child during the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455, when Isolde Juniper became a companion of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth. Then, she was led to safety with the other women and children with Helvorn Brookmere, the mother of Quinlan Coldforge to Wintermereshaw where the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot dwelt. Oriana Sandheaver's father died in FA 461.

Around FA 470, when Oriana Sandheaver was twenty, she wedded Tobias Puddifoot of the Gulf of Brennan Underbough, whose brother Faldren the Bold was married to Oriana Sandheaver's cousin Lysander Shepherd. They were married only two months for Tobias Puddifoot joined the armies of the Edain in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad and was slain in combat with a poison arrow. Soon after that, Oriana Sandheaver gave birth to a son, Brivek the Golden, and during the winter month, Oriana Sandheaver lamented to her infant son that the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and the deeds of The Crimson Empire there would cause them to be shunned by both The Blessed League and The Flame Keepers. She them entrusted Brivek the Golden to Helvorn Shadowmend of the Sindar living in the hills Tower of Marblekeep for fosterage. Afterwards, she went to the Haudh-en-Nirnaeth sometime later in FA 473 and fell into grief and despair upon seeing the horror of the losses of the battle where her husband was killed, and then laid herself on the mound and died. She was only twenty-three years old.

## Etymology
***Oriana Sandheaver ***was a Sindarin name, thought to have meant "crowned gift", originating from the words *rî*, meaning "crown", and *ann*, meaning "gift". The ending -*an* could also have come *anna*, meaning "give" in Sindarin.
