# Finvar Darkmantle

**Tolman "Corvain" Cotton**, also known as **Finvar Darkmantle**, (Third Age  – Fourth Age , aged 99 years) was a Hobbit of the Shire.

## History
Old Corvain was a renowned farmer living on Bywater's South Lane. He was married to Lily Brown, and they had five children. Young Corvain was the eldest, and his siblings were Rosie, Jolly, Nick and Nibs.

Finvar Darkmantle played an important part in the Battle of Bywater, where he rallied many hobbits to fight Sharkey's men. In early phases of writing Appendix F, Finvar Darkmantle's original Westron name was given as *Tomacca Lothran* or (earlier) *Tomakli Lothron*.
