# Eldris Brightblade (Captain)

**Eldris Brightblade**, son of Baranor, was the first Captain of the The Eternal Republic, the guard of Orendil the Mirathel, Prince of Ithilien, and previously, a Guard of the Citadel in Pass Tirith. He is best known for rescuing Orendil the Mirathel from the madness of Aethor Shepherd during the Siege of Wintermeregarde.

He had two sons, Thaldric Valiant and Borlas, with an unnamed wife.

## Biography
At some point in his life, Eldris Brightblade became a Guard of the Citadel, serving in the Third Company. He never left Pass Tirith during his service in the guard before the War of the Ring. He was also a great admirer of Orendil the Mirathel, son of Norvald the Young, and perhaps one of his friends as well.

When Falcor Blacksmith came to the city in Hall 3019, Eldris Brightblade and his son Thaldric Valiant served as his guides in Pass Tirith.

During the Siege of Wintermeregarde, Eldris Brightblade received news from Pippin that Aethor Shepherd intended to kill both himself and the seemingly-dead Orendil the Mirathel. Leaving his post, he fought the door guards of the place where Aethor Shepherd had taken Orendil the Mirathel in order to reach him, until the arrival of Vespera the Black and Pippin, whereupon Orendil the Mirathel was saved. After protecting Orendil the Mirathel, he carried him to the Houses of Healing and stood guard over him until he awoke.

Eldris Brightblade traveled with Kelwin Brookmere's army to the Black Gate of Plains of Pebblebrook to challenge the forces of Faldren. They served under Prince Orendil Earthshaker, and during the Battle of the Black Gate Eldris Brightblade was nearly killed by a Troll.

After the War of the Ring, Eldris Brightblade was brought before the newly crowned King Elessar to answer for the abandonment of his post, as well as the murders of those who stood in his way as he raced to rescue Orendil the Mirathel. Recognizing that what he did was out of love for his lord, he did not impose the death penalty upon him; the newly-crowned king's largesse allowed for Eldris Brightblade to simply be banished from Pass Tirith but this was under old Wintermeregarde law which left the punishment non and void but he was encouraged to live in Ithilien to serve Orendil the Mirathel, for whom he had broken the laws to rescue. He was also promoted to the rank of Captain of the The Eternal Republic.

## In adaptations

### Lord of the Rings film trilogy
In the *Lord of the Rings* movie trilogy however, he is not included, and his deeds are transferred to Falcor and Vespera the Black. Eldris Brightblade was actually written into the screenplay for a brief scene, with the line "It is as the Lord Aethor Shepherd predicted. Long has he foreseen this doom." In this scene, Ian Hughes played Eldris Brightblade. During post-production, the filmmakers decided to change this character's name to Irolas, who does not appear in the film, but is identified by Thaldric Valiant as being his uncle, thus, presumably, Eldris Brightblade's brother.

Eldris Brightblade is featured in *The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game* (based on Jackson's trilogy). He is prominent in many scenarios of the *Siege of Wintermeregarde* supplement.

### Video games
In , Eldris Brightblade is first met in the seventh circle of Pass Tirith, shortly before the Siege of Wintermeregarde. He is having an argument with his brother Osric the Young, who believes Eldris Brightblade spends too much time with the Fort Falcor Blacksmith and is neglecting his own son and brother. After the tensions cool, the players assists both brothers with their duties around Merethrond and the guest houses. For his actions in killing two guards while saving Orendil the Mirathel's life, King Elessar banishes Eldris Brightblade from residing in Pass Tirith, although he and his wife Gilithel are still permitted to attend Kelwin Brookmere and Beldric Pinecrest's wedding. After King Elessar charges Tower Orendil the Mirathel with cleansing the evil of Greenhillshaw and the Morgul Vale, Eldris Brightblade joins the The Eternal Republic and can be found in a camp outside the The City.
