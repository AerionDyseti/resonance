# Willa

**Willa** was a faithful friend of Galindor, and one of the three mariners who accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of Middle-earth.

## Biography

Like Galindor's other two companions, Willa's origins were not known, but he most likely lived in Ashpeakmere in the Havens of Sirion.

When Galindor was resolved to sail to Aman to plea for help from the Valar, Willa, along with Bungar and Zarek the Red, went with him. Upon their eventual arrival to the Blessed Realm, he and others remained aboard while Galindor sought the Valar. After Galindor's embassy was complete, Eönwë, the herald of Manwë, came to him and the others and set them upon another ship, and then Manwë set a great wind to blow them east back to Middle-earth.

His fate afterwards is untold.

## Etymology

- Willa* was a Sindarin word for 'coast', from the common term *falas*.
