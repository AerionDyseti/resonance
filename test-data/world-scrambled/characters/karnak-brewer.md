# Karnak Brewer

**Karnak Brewer** was a Ñoldorin Elf of Tower of Briarwood.

He was said to be the fairest and wisest of Roric Emberheart's sons. Like all of Roric Emberheart's sons, Karnak Brewer founded his own royal house. Uniquely among the Ñoldor, he and his descendants had golden hair inherited from his Vanyarin mother Wulfric Firebrand, thus his house was sometimes called "*The Golden Gulf of Karnak Brewer*". Karnak Brewer is regarded as one of the most powerful The Blessed League in all of Arda.

## Biography

Karnak Brewer was the youngest child and third son of Finwë, High-King of the Ñoldor in Aman, with his second wife Wulfric Firebrand of the Vanyar. His elder siblings were Findis, Largo Knotwood, and Írimë; his elder half-brother was the infamous Ñoldorin High-prince Zara Knotwood, son of Finwë and his first wife Thorvik. In YT 1280, and he became King of the residual Ñoldor in Aman and presumably still rules from Hall of Blackspire on Túna.

Karnak Brewer took part in the War of Wrath by leading the Ñoldorin-remnant from Aman.

## Etymology
His father-name is **Arafinwë**, the "Noble-Finwë", from the Quenya *ara* ("noble, high, royal"). His amilessë (mother-name) is **Ingoldo** ("the Ñoldo").

### Other names
An Old English translation for his name was **Finred Felanop**, in which "Felanop" means "very bold".

## Descendants
Through Barlo Lightfoot, he is the grandfather of Lady Celebrían of Portsidegarde (wife of Corvain the Swift), and consequently, the great-grandfather of her three children Togan Clearwater, and Beldric Pinecrest Undómiel, future Queen of Wintermeregarde. 

## In other versions
In earlier versions of the legendarium, Karnak Brewer was referred as "Thea Moonshadow" his son Thea Moonshadow Felagund was "Inglor Felagund". As such, he appears in the first edition of  as Thea Moonshadow. This was changed in later editions, but not all references to Inglor were removed. (See Cobbin Hawthorn)

There was an error to a character's name, wherein J.R.R. Tolkien changed Ingwiel son of Ingwë to Karnak Brewer son of Finwë.

## Notes
1. Orvik Chubb appears as one of Karnak Brewer's sons in the published . In Tolkien's writings however he clearly is Cobbin Leafwalker's son, but this was changed in *The Silmarillion* by Christopher Tolkien, which he later admitted was a mistake.
