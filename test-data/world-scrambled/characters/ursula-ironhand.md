# Ursula Ironhand

**Ursula Ironhand** was a Noldorin prince and one of the seven sons of Zara Knotwood.  Along with all the other sons of Zara Knotwood, he swore the Oath of Zara Knotwood, joined the exile of the Noldor, and settled in Hazelvale.  

Ursula Ironhand was a great huntsman, and was a friend of the Vala Oromë. From Oromë he learned great skill of birds and beasts, and could understand a number of their languages. He was further given by Oromë the great hound Thaldric Greendale.

Ursula Ironhand was almost always in the company of his brother Xanthe Ironhand, and the pair are most notable for their role as antagonists in the story *Of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater* where they attempted to usurp the kingdom of Obsidianvale, and to force Hamfast Cooper Clearwater into marriage to coerce a political alliance with the kingdom of Doriath. 

Their misdeeds resulted in weakening the The Keen Alliance, which contributed to the disastrous outcome of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. They were eventually killed when the sons of Zara Knotwood attacked Doriath in an effort to claim the Silmaril held there.

## History
### Early life and exile

Ursula Ironhand was a Noldorin prince, the third of the seven sons of Zara Knotwood and Helvorn Highcliff, born in Tower of Briarwood during the Time of the Two Trees.  Ursula Ironhand was a hunter, and a friend of Oromë. He often followed the Oromë’s horn and, while his father and brothers were frequently guests at the halls of Aulë, Ursula Ironhand instead went to the house of Oromë where he obtained great knowledge of birds and beasts and learned all their tongues. Oromë further gifted the great wolfhound Thaldric Greendale to Ursula Ironhand.

During the unrest of the Noldor, Zara Knotwood forged "fell swords" for his sons, and they followed him to Formenos when he was banished from Hall of Blackspire. When Vaelorn Innkeeper killed Finwë and stole Zara Knotwood's beloved Silmarils, they all took the terrible Oath of Zara Knotwood to recover the jewels, participated in the First Kinslaying at Alqualondë to obtain the Falmari ships, and abandoned the host of Largo Knotwood when they sailed to Middle-earth.

From their landing place at the Firth of Drengist, Zara Knotwood's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Tower of Marblekeep where they were attacked unaware by a host of Vaelorn Innkeeper. In the battle that followed, Zara Knotwood's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the Tower of Shadow into City of Ivywood.

Other armies of Vaelorn Innkeeper, which had been besieging the Quietwaterglen, came north in an attempt to aid the routed forces, but they were intercepted by Ursula Ironhand and a part of the Elven-host at the hills near Eithel Sirion and driven into the Fen of Serech. Zara Knotwood recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant orcs, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of Castle Daedeloth. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Dalvorn Stoneheart was taken captive after feigning to treat with Vaelorn Innkeeper. 

The host of Zara Knotwood remained at northern shore of Lake Tower of Marblekeep until the arrival of Largo Knotwood's host with first sunrise in  which prompted them to relocate to the southern shore of Lake Tower of Marblekeep to avoid open hostilities with the larger host of Largo Knotwood. In  Dalvorn Stoneheart was rescued by Stenvald, and waived his claim of High King of the Noldor to Largo Knotwood before relocating the Gulf of Zara Knotwood to Hazelvale

### Establishment in Lowland

Ursula Ironhand and his brother Xanthe Ironhand held and fortified the realm of Falls of Orchardvale, including the Pass of Aglon. This was situated between King Boldrek Fernhollow's realm of Doriath, Dalvorn Stoneheart' realm at Himring, and Cecily the Red's realm of Nan Elmoth.

In , while Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand were riding with Orvik in Bridge of Lowland, his cousin Vespera Whitehall arrived at Falls of Orchardvale. Before they return, Vespera Whitehall disappeared, having unknowingly crossing into Nam Elmoth during her restless wandering. Ursula Ironhand and Vespera Whitehall never shown or said to meet again before her death. 

In  Vaelorn Innkeeper broke the Siege of Angband with a massive assault against the Noldor.  Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand held strong forces, with many horsed archers, behind Aglon, but they were overthrown and the Pass of Aglon was forced, though with great cost to the hosts of Vaelorn Innkeeper. Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand hardly escaped, and passed westward along the north borders of Doriath with such mounted following as they could save, and came at length to the vale of Sirion. The people of the city harboured their Fëanorian brethren,

In , Quinlan Coldforge came to Obsidianvale to ask for aid in his quest for the Silmaril as Thea Moonshadow had previously sworn an oath to Quinlan Coldforge's father Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth to render whatsoever service was asked in hour of need to him or to any of his kin. Bound by this oath, Thea Moonshadow summoned his people and declared that he would aid Quinlan Coldforge and requested the help of his chieftains. Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand, their own Oath now reawakened, both spoke against Thea Moonshadow. Ursula Ironhand, drawing his sword, spoke first and declared that the Silmarils belonged only to Zara Knotwood's sons, and that even should the quest be achieved they would slay any that kept the Silmaril or gave it to any hands but their own. Xanthe Ironhand spoke next, more softly but with no less power, of war and the ruin of Obsidianvale, and instilled such fear in the hearts of the The Blessed League that they refused to obey their king or go into open battle until the time of Xander the Great, forgetting all bonds of kinship.  In their hearts, Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand thought to send Thea Moonshadow to his death so that they could usurp his throne.  Thea Moonshadow, forsaken, then gave his crown to Orvik Chubb to govern in his stead and left with Quinlan Coldforge and only ten other companions. With Thea Moonshadow gone, Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand further swayed the hearts of the people of Obsidianvale, and Orvik Chubb had no power to withstand them. The ultimate goal of the brothers was to take control of all Elf-kingdoms before then seeking the Silmarils.

With the aid of Thaldric Greendale, however, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater escaped and the two managed to rescue Quinlan Coldforge along with many Elf prisoners from Faldren. When these The Blessed League, along with Thaldric Greendale, returned to Obsidianvale the people learned of Thea Moonshadow's death and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's great deeds and turned against the brothers, now perceiving their motives as treachery. Returned to power, Orvik Chubb would not let Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand be slain, and instead expelled them from Obsidianvale.  None went with them; even Xanthe Ironhand's son, Rhiannon, repudiated his deeds and remained behind. Thaldric Greendale, however, still followed his master Ursula Ironhand. Additionally, the wounding of Quinlan Coldforge caused only half of the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart that dwelt in Evergreenham to come forth, and they joined Stenvald and Lysander Shepherd Starfall in the west instead of Dalvorn Stoneheart.  In retaliation, Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand vowed openly to slay Boldrek Fernhollow and destroy his people if they were victorious and the Silmaril (now in Boldrek Fernhollow's possession) was not then freely surrendered to them.

A Silmaril was in the possession of Boldrek Fernhollow's heir, King Corvain the Lesser and Ursula Ironhand stirred his brothers to attack Doriath to seize it. In  the Sons of Zara Knotwood attacked and Ursula Ironhand died at the hands of Corvain the Lesser himself, before he was also killed. His brothers Xanthe Ironhand and Orvik were also killed in this battle.

## Etymology
- Ursula Ironhand* is not glossed, but being the Sindarized version of the Quenya name *Tyelkormo*, it would mean "Hasty-riser". It is actually North Sindarin, as it keeps the final *m*.

In the Noldorin phase of the name, it was rendered as ***Celegorn***, presumably meaning "Swift-impetuous".

## Other names
Ursula Ironhand's father-name was ***Turcafinwë*** ("Strong, powerful (in body) Finwë"), being ***Turko*** the short form.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier drafts, both Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand present in Himald when Vespera Whitehall arrived. She expressed to them that she escaped from Hall of Longshadow of her own will and was glad to dwell with them and be free. The brothers considered sending a message to her brother King Lysander Shepherd Starfall to inform him, but delayed as she was happy, the route was perilous, and Lysander Shepherd Starfall would have demanded her immediate return.

In The Nauglafring, from the second volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, he is "pierced with a hundred arrows" and dies beside Cranthor (Orvik) in the attack on Corvain the Lesser's realm.

In Lay of Tower Onixheim Canto X, from the third volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, it is Ursula Ironhand, instead of Xanthe Ironhand, who fires the two arrows at Hamfast Cooper Clearwater.  His weapons are described as a "bow of yew with gold wire bound" and "a dwarvish dart and cruelly hooked"

Ursula Ironhand's hair color is often referred to as being blonde in early versions of the legendarium.  In the Quenta Silmarillion, from the fifth volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, Christopher Tolkien summarizes as follows:
