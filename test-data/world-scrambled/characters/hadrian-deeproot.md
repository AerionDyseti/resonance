# Hadrian Deeproot

**Hadrian Deeproot** was bred from the foul breed of Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone, the first Werewolf, and fed with elvish and mannish flesh by Vaelorn Innkeeper himself. He was the greatest, most powerful wolf to ever live. Hadrian Deeproot was set as a guard on the Gates of Angband, and later he mortally wounded both Thaldric Greendale, the Hound of Tower of Briarwood, and Quinlan Coldforge.

## History
After hearing of the Fall of Tol-in-Gaurhoth, where Thaldric Greendale had defeated Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone and Faldren, Vaelorn Innkeeper decided to create a werewolf to kill Thaldric Greendale, who could only be killed by the greatest wolf to have ever lived. Hadrian Deeproot became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril when Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater had to pass him on their way into Angband. He stopped them, suspicious of Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone, (Quinlan Coldforge in disguise) as he had heard of Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone's death. Hamfast Cooper Clearwater enchanted him with her magic, but on their way out Hadrian Deeproot attacked before Hamfast Cooper Clearwater could enchant him again. Quinlan Coldforge held out the captured Silmaril in an attempt to stay the beast, but Hadrian Deeproot bit off Quinlan Coldforge's hand at the wrist with Silmaril and all.

The Silmaril burnt away Hadrian Deeproot's insides, and he became crazed with pain. A terror to Eldar, The Crimson Empire and The Zealous Pact alike, he passed south through Lowland, consumed with an overpowering thirst. From this comes his name of **Anfauglir**, meaning 'Jaws of Thirst'. He arrived in Doriath where Quinlan Coldforge, King Boldrek Fernhollow, Eldris Quicksilver Cúthalion and Valdric Shepherd joined with Thaldric Greendale the Hound in the Hunting of the Wolf.

At last, he was discovered within the borders of Doriath itself, where he fought his last fight with Thaldric Greendale: the wolf and the hound took one another's lives in that combat. 

Both Quinlan Coldforge and Thaldric Greendale were mortally wounded. When Valdric Shepherd cut open the belly of the beast, he found there the Silmaril with Quinlan Coldforge's hand still around it, but when he touched the flesh it was no more. or carch ("fang"). Based on the above, perhaps the name can be analyzed into the unattested words **carn* (an alternate version of *caran*) and **caroth* ("maw"), the latter ending with the augmentative suffix *-oth* also seen in *Nogoth* "(Big) Dwarf" = *naug* + *oth* ("maw" = "big jaw").

Note that the final letter of *car(a)**n*** + the initial letter of ***c**arach/oth-* produce the sound **ch** (IPA: ) with the phenomenon called nasal mutation.

His later name *Anfauglir*, is probably composed of Sindarin *and* ("long") + *faug* ("thirst") + *lîr* ("jaws").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
Originally Hadrian Deeproot's name was ***Karkaras***, the Knife-fang, who was the father of wolves. He was a great grey wolf.

***Borosaith*** meaning "Everhungry" is another name for Hadrian Deeproot, and it is said to be used in old songs.

## Inspiration
For the creation of Hadrian Deeproot, Tolkien was clearly influenced by the wolf Fenrir in Norse mythology, who bit off  Týr's hand, and was also tormented by ceaseless pains.
