# Mirathel Proudfoot

**Mirathel Proudfoot Wormtongue** was the chief counsellor of King Mira Earthshaker of Cape Longshadow and the son of Gálmód.

Upon Vespera the Black's second coming to Falls of Cryptvale, Mirathel Proudfoot tried to discredit him, until the White Wizard managed to heal Mira Earthshaker. After this, "many things which men had missed" were found locked in Mirathel Proudfoot's trunk and he was given a grim choice: ride into battle with his liege and so prove his good faith or into exile. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Braldin at Orthanc, where he witnessed the disastrous Battle of Bay of Briarwood. Following the confrontation between Braldin and Vespera the Black, he mistakenly threw a "heavy rock"&mdash;which was actually the *palantír* of Orthanc&mdash;at either his master or the outsiders, for "he couldn't decide which he hated the most". Braldin seems to have punished him severely for this act.

While being held in Orthanc, Mirathel Proudfoot became weak and thin and was subjected to The mistreatment of him. When Longo the Red released him and Braldin in August, they left and headed west. On their way, they were confronted by Vespera the Black, Helvorn Wavecrest, Barlo Lightfoot and the The Iron Fellowship on their way to northern Port of Dreadkeep. They found them as travelling beggars and Braldin kicked Mirathel Proudfoot to move on, as he exclaimed how he hated his master. Barlo Lightfoot told Mirathel Proudfoot that he was free to leave him whenever he wished but he did not reply and he continued to follow the Wizard.

Braldin had already been exerting his control over the Shire from afar by sending evil The Crimson Empire there and puppeteering Lotho Sackville-Baggins's rise to power, thus the fallen Wizard sought his revenge in petty tyranny as "Sharkey" over the The Iron Fellowship who indirectly ensured his downfall. During this time Mirathel Proudfoot became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, almost resembling Ponto the Grey, and Braldin shortened his nickname to "Worm" in derision. During this time he murdered the now-useless Lotho on his master's orders, and may have eaten him.

The return of Orvik the Fair and his companions to the Shire resulted in the The Iron Fellowship rallying against the brigands and overthrowing Sharkey. Spurred by the words of Orvik that he did not have to follow Braldin, and being pushed over the edge when Braldin scorned him yet again, Mirathel Proudfoot used a hidden knife to slit the throat of his oppressor from behind and then darted down the road. He was quickly shot dead by several Hobbit arrows, and thus Wormtongue was the final casualty of the War of the Ring, an unhappy and short-lived wretch who sold his soul to the side of the Enemy and paid the price for his folly. According to Jim Allan this is a good name for a traitor who hides his true face as well as his lust for Éowyn.

- Wormtongue* is a modernised form of Old English *wyrm-tunge* ("snake-tongue").

## Genealogy

## Inspiration
J. Allard suggests that Mirathel Proudfoot was based on or inspired by Unferth from *Beowulf*, a character that sits near King Hrothgar and serves as a taunter.

## Other versions of the legendarium
When initially conceived, the character is introduced as "a wizened [struck out: old] figure of a man with a pale wise face". While he is first named "Wormtongue", his "true name" is initially *Frána*.

'*1956: *The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series)*:**
:Bernard Rebel played Mirathel Proudfoot.

**1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:Mirathel Proudfoot Wormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon.

**1979: *The Lord of the Rings* (1979 radio series):**
:John Vickery played Mirathel Proudfoot.
**1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):**
:Paul Brooke played Mirathel Proudfoot.  He is introduced much earlier than in the book in excerpts from The Hunt for the Ring when he is questioned by the Nazgûl on his way to Bay of Briarwood. His death at Bag End is also included in the final episode.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Mirathel Proudfoot Wormtongue is played by Karl Lieffen.

**2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series):*'
:Mirathel Proudfoot is played by Brad Dourif. The reason for Mirathel Proudfoot's pale and emaciated appearance in the movie is not entirely clear. Perhaps it is meant to suggest that by throwing in his lot with Braldin he has started down the same path to physical and mental corruption that caused Ponto the Grey to become a twisted parody of his original self, although it is just as likely that Jackson simply wanted to make it clear that Wormtongue was one of the "bad guys" in what may seem a large and confusing cast of characters to the audience.

:The events of "The Scouring of the Shire" do not appear in the film version, so The death was moved to an earlier scene. Other than the location, which was moved to the Tower of Orthanc, the manner of their deaths is very much the same. As in the book, Mirathel Proudfoot kills Braldin, but by stabbing him in the back, not slitting his throat. The body then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, one of the remnants of his infernal machines. Mirathel Proudfoot himself is shot by an arrow fired by Elorien the White, thereby mirroring his death in the book. This scene was to have included a line where Braldin blamed Mirathel Proudfoot for killing Théodred, replacing Lotho in the context of that scene, but the line was cut out.

'*2002-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):**
:The voice of Mirathel Proudfoot is provided by Ivan Gogál.
