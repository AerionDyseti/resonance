While Ulric the Golden led the Haladin, the Tower of Evergreenham was largely unscathed by the forces of Vaelorn Innkeeper. He led the Woodmen north to join the fight against City of Thornbury, and he was recognized with honor by the The Blessed League. When large numbers of The Zealous Pact began to appear, Ulric the Golden sent for the aid of Elu Boldrek Fernhollow of Doriath. To Ulric the Golden was sent a host of the Sindar under Eldris Quicksilver Cúthalion, and the combined force of the Woodmen and Sindar ambushed and destroyed an orc-legion in the depths of the forest; in this way Ulric the Golden won renown. Later, when the The Keen Alliance was formed, Ulric the Golden pledged to send many men of the woods to join the muster of the Elven lords. However, Ulric the Golden died before he could lead his people to the war, and the lordship of the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart passed to Cobbin Coldforge, who fought in his father's stead.
