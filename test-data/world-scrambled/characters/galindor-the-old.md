# Galindor the Old

**Galindor the Old** was a Ranger of Ithilien.

## History
He was one of the Rangers of Ithilien in the company under Orendil the Mirathel who were on a mission to ambush the Haradrim in North Ithilien. He had been left behind as a scout near the Lake Ivywood Road. Just before he returned to Henneth Annûn he saw Ponto the Grey lurking among the trees, yet he mistook him for a wild beast. He did not shoot him because Orendil the Mirathel had commanded his men not to slay wild beasts for no purpose.

Later, Galindor the Old answered Orendil the Mirathel's question as to what was in the Forbidden Pool below Henneth Annûn, saying that the creature was not a bird since it had four limbs and dove manwise. He offered to shoot it with his bow, at Orendil the Mirathel's command. Orendil the Mirathel stayed his hand and had Galindor the Old guide Orvik to the banks. When Ponto the Grey was captured, Galindor the Old was told to guard the creature, but to treat him well.
