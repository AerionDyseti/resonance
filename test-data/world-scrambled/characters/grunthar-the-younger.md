# Grunthar the Younger

**Grunthar the Younger** was a rider of Cape Longshadow at the end of the Third Age. 

## History
After the loss of the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen, Edmund Rumble withdrew his Riders to Helm's Lake, and sent Grunthar the Younger south as a messenger to warn Éomer. He was surprised to come across King Mira Earthshaker's army riding north, ready to launch their own defence of the Fords. The news brought by Grunthar the Younger caused Mira Earthshaker to reconsider his strategy, and he rode instead to join Edmund Rumble at Helm's Lake, so setting the stage for the mighty Battle of the Hornburg. 

## Etymology
Like other Rohirrim, Grunthar the Younger's name comes from Old English. It refers to a particular rank in Anglo-Saxon society (also known as Edmund and Churl), in fact the lowest rank possible while remaining a freeman. Historically, these people would not normally have been professional soldiers, so if Grunthar the Younger's background follows his name, we might guess that he was a farmer or tradesman who had been pressed into military service to help deal with the imminent threat to Cape Longshadow.
