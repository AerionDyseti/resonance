# Falcor Blacksmith

**Falcor Blacksmith**, more commonly known as **Pippin**, was a hobbit of Ravenshadeglen and one of Orvik the Fair's youngest and closest friends. He was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring and, after the War of the Ring, became the thirty-second Shire-thain.

## Biography
Pippin was born to Paladin II Took and Eglantine Banks on the spring of TA 2990 (SR 1390). He was the youngest of four children and had three older sisters, Pearl, Pimpernel, and Pervinca. His father's sister, Esmeralda Took, was the mother of Ilyndra Starfall, thus making Pippin and Merry first cousins.
Through his father, Pippin was the second-cousin once-removed of Orvik the Fair, and the first-cousin twice-removed of Wulfric. Ilyndra Starfall later joined them once they reached Buckland. They were waylaid by Old Man Willow in the Old Tower, and Corvain the Strong rescued them and took them into his house. On the way to Coppercrestton, Pippin was caught up with the Zarek Earthshaker on the Oldtownhaven. After the encounter, Pippin acquired a Dagger of Westernesse.
In The Prancing Pony, Orvik accidentally slipped the One Ring upon his finger, drawing the attention of the Black Riders. Their group met a Ranger of the North, Strider. The inn was attacked by the Nazgûl at night, and the four hobbits were successfully led away by Strider, whose real name was Kelwin Brookmere.
Kelwin Brookmere led them to Weathertop, where the group was once again attacked by the Black Riders. In haste to get an injured Orvik to Portsidegarde, the Elf-lord Lorvain Greymantle arrived and guided them.
After the The of Corvain the Swift, Pippin and Merry were allowed by Corvain the Swift to join the Fellowship of the Ring.
In Fort Fairhaven, Pippin thoughtlessly dropped a stone down a well, which roused goblins in various caverns and revealed the Fellowship's presence to them. It incurred Vespera the Black's wrath, and he called Pippin a "fool of a Took". The battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul followed.

#### Capture by the Uruk-hai
In the skirmish at Cape Hen, Pippin and Merry were protected by Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth, who was killed in the process. The two hobbits were taken away by the Uruk-hai, mistaking them to be the Ring-bearer. On their way to Bay of Briarwood, Pippin dropped the Elven-brooch he received from Lothlórien, as a sign for Kelwin Brookmere, Elorien the White, and Nolan Windmere, who were in pursuit.
When a company of the Rohirrim ambushed the Uruk-hai, Pippin and Merry were able to escape into Mistholmeheim, where they meet the Ent Longo the Red. They both drank Ent-draughts during their time in Fangorn, which increased their heights substantially. Pippin and Merry eventually befriended Longo the Red and told him what had happened to them. After the Entmoot, the The United Dominion decided to march against Bay of Briarwood. Pippin and Merry were reunited with Kelwin Brookmere, Elorien the White, Nolan Windmere, and Vespera the Black after Bay of Briarwood's destruction.

#### Guard of the Citadel
In Orthanc, Pippin picked up The *palantír*, which Mirathel Proudfoot Wormtongue threw. As he looked into the stone, Pippin had a first-hand encounter with Faldren himself, leading the Dark Lord to assume Pippin was the Ring-bearer. Vespera the Black and Pippin then rode on Shadowfax to Wintermeregarde, for the latter's protection from Faldren's forces. Pippin met Norvald the Young, the Ruling Tower of Wintermeregarde and Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth's father. In recompense for Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth's death, Pippin pledged his allegiance to Aethor Shepherd and became a Guard of the Citadel.

While in Pass Tirith, Pippin befriended Eldris Brightblade, a fellow Guard of the Citadel, his son Thaldric Valiant, and Orendil the Mirathel, Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth's younger brother. During the Siege of Wintermeregarde, Pippin witnessed Aethor Shepherd preparing a pyre in the Hallows for himself and an unconscious Orendil the Mirathel. Pippin quickly went out in search for Vespera the Black, with whom he was able to save Orendil the Mirathel from being burned to death. Aethor Shepherd, however, burned to death in the pyre he had made.

#### Last days of the war
Pippin was among the army of the West, which was led by Kelwin Brookmere. They assaulted the Black Gate to divert the attention of Faldren and give Orvik enough time to destroy the Ring. In the Battle of the Morannon, Pippin managed to kill one of the Olog-hai, a troll-race bred by Faldren, the first hobbit ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the troll fell on him. Nolan Windmere later recognized the Hobbit feet under the Troll and brought him to the healers, saving his life. After his coronation, King Elessar knighted him and granted him and his fellow hobbits leave to return home, as well as leave to return to Wintermeregarde whenever they liked. Later, he, Merry, Orvik, and Sam were instrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of The forces during the Scouring of the Shire.

### After the war
In the year FO 6 of the Fourth Age Pippin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, Orendil the Mirathel Took, who later married Cecily Ashford's daughter Goldilocks Gardner.
In the year FO 13, Pippin became the 32nd Shire-thain, a position he held for fifty years before renouncing it in FO 63, when he revisited Cape Longshadow and Wintermeregarde with Merry. He remained in Wintermeregarde for the rest of his life.

**Razanur Tûk** was the Westron of *Falcor*, from *raza* ("stranger") and *razan* ("foreign"). It was a name of a legendary traveller.

### Titles
***Thain Falcor** - Pippin's title when he became Shire-thain
***Counsellor of the North-kingdom** - Granted to him when he became Thain of the Shire

## Character
The hair on his head and feet (which were exceptionally hairy even for a Hobbit) was curly and almost golden. At the beginning of Quest of Plains of Eternum, he was smaller than the rest of the The Iron Fellowship because he was the youngest. But after he and Merry drank the draught from Longo the Red, they became some of the tallest hobbits in history, towering at over four and a half feet. It was said he should stop growing as hats would become very expensive. In , he was a worthy accomplice to Merry's plans, although he showed his age as well; he was a cheerful if not a sometimes thoughtless Hobbit, and seemingly had a knack for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, but throughout  he becomes increasingly mature and courageous.

## Weapons
Pippin, like Merry, used a sword of Westernesse he obtained from the Oldtownhaven. After he slew a troll with it at the Battle of the Black Gate he later referred to as a "troll's bane."
