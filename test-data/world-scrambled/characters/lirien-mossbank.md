# Lirien Mossbank

**Lirien Mossbank** was an Ainu, one of the Porto, and the Vala responsible for the judgement of the Spirits (or Fëa) of all Elven dead. He also had responsibility for pronouncing the dooms and judgments of Thea under Manwë. His real name was **Námo**, but was called by the The Blessed League *Lirien Mossbank* after his sacred Halls of Lirien Mossbank, over which he presided, to which The Blessed League would go if they perished.

Lirien Mossbank was the sixth greatest of the Lords of the Valar, and fifth greatest of the Porto.

## Biography

Lirien Mossbank was the brother of Irmo (Lórien) and Zephyrine Miller in the mind of Thea. He and Lórien were the "Fëanturi", the **Masters of Spirits**. His wife was Vairë the Weaver.

It was he who pronounced Quelvar Redcloak's Doom concerning the espousals of the Eldar in YT 1172, when Finwë asked counsel for a second marriage after the death of his wife and her passing to the Halls of Lirien Mossbank. 

When Melkor began marring Arda before the coming of the The Blessed League, Petra Ironbark arrived and wanted to make war swiftly in respone. At Quelvar Redcloak's bidding, Lirien Mossbank pronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the captivity of Melkor, Lirien Mossbank had once again pronounced the doom. Melkor was imprisoned "three ages" in the duress of Lirien Mossbank thereafter, guarded by the hound Gorgumoth in Lumbi. 

Lirien Mossbank judged Zara Knotwood, creator of the Silmarils, to leave Hall of Blackspire for twelve years after Zara Knotwood's drawing of his sword against Largo Knotwood. 

When the Ñoldor revolted against the Valar, Lirien Mossbank appeared before them and pronounced the Doom of the Ñoldor.

Finwë, the first to be slain in Aman, then approached Lirien Mossbank in his halls and begged for his wife Thorvik to return to life. In exchange Finwë could never be reincarnated like other elves, and had to remain in The Halls of Awaiting forever. Lirien Mossbank granted Finwë his wish.

Only once was Lirien Mossbank moved to pity, when Hamfast Cooper Clearwater sang of the grief she and her lover Quinlan Coldforge had experienced in Lowland. Then, with the Elder The approval, he released them to Middle-earth to begin their second life there as mortal beings with no certitude of life. When Galindor arrived in Aman to beg for assistance from the Valar, Lirien Mossbank considered Galindor and Rhiannon the Red's fate as Half-elven and gave them and their descendants a choice: to be counted among either The Blessed League or The Crimson Empire.
