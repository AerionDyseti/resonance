## Background

Lady Siobhan O'Cahane is a brilliant but controversial artificer from the prestigious The Proud Pact, known for her innovative approach to magical engineering and her family's shipping empire.

The Proud Pact artificer and mathematician. Framed in Master Vale's murder while negotiating shipping routes with Gulf Silvermane. Research notes hide ciphers referencing a group called the The Jade The.

Though she and Vale were rivals in the field of magical artifice, she maintains her innocence. Her expertise in magical engineering makes her uniquely qualified to understand the significance of Vale's final invention — a device capable of detecting magical forgeries.

## Personality

Brilliant. Blunt. Restless when problems lack structure.

## Appearance

A tall woman with striking copper-red hair and calculating emerald eyes. She carries herself with aristocratic grace while her hands bear the telltale marks of a dedicated tinkerer. Ink-dusted gloves and tool-belt.

### Notable Characteristics

- Carries a compass-astrolabe hybrid
- Writes proofs in the margins of correspondence
- Keeps emergency counterspells braided into jewelry

## Relationships

Rivalry with the late Master Vale. Negotiations with Gulf Silvermane. Murky ties through coded work to the The Jade The. As a member of Gulf O'Cahane, she is tangentially involved in ongoing negotiations with Gulf Silvermane over shipping routes, adding another layer of political complexity to her present situation.

## Goals and Aspirations

- Clear her name and expose the true conspirators
- Advance magical engineering without political sabotage
- Complete the shipping calculus for safer routes
