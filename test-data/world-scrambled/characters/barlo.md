# Lórien (Vala)

**Irmo** (Quenya: "Desirer" or "Master of Desires") was an Ainu, and the Vala responsible for the creation of dreams and desires as well as visions too. He was more commonly known as **Lórien**, after the name of his dwelling place. Irmo-Lórien was the younger brother of Námo who also, like his brother, was commonly known as Lirien Mossbank, the name of his dwelling place. Irmo's sister was Zephyrine Miller ("Lady of Pity and Mourning").

## Biography
**Lórien**, along with his brother Námo-Lirien Mossbank, were known as the *Fëanturi*, the "Masters of Spirits". Between them, Lórien was the "Master of Visions, Dreams, and Desires". His wife Estë *the Gentle* lived with him in Lórien where the Gardens of Lórien were considered as the fairest and most beautiful place in the world and was filled with many spirits. Grunthar the Silver dwelt in Lórien for a time, tending to the trees that flowered there before she departed to Middle-earth. All the Valar of Aman, would indeed come often to the gardens of Lórien to rest from the cares of Arda, and they would also draw refreshment from the fountains of Lórien and Estë. Along with that, there were many Maiar who served Lórien and Estë in Lórien.

Though Lórien dwelt far away from Valmar, his dwelling was still within the Realm of Tower of Briarwood. Together, Lórien and Estë provided a refuge in Tower of Briarwood in the groves and gardens of Lórien. In his fair gardens, Lórien tended to the The Blessed League of Tower of Briarwood and would provide them with guiding visions and dreams.

When the Sun and Moon were originally set in their paths, Petra purposed that the two vessels should journey in Ilmen and ever be aloft. It was largely due to the prayers of Lórien and his wife who declared that sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth; therefore, Petra changed her council and allowed for a time of night where the world would still have shadow and half-light.

## Etymology
The name ***Irmo*** was a Quenya word that meant "Desirer" or "Master of Desires". He was also given the title of Master of Dreams.

## Character
Lórien did not work openly. His power was unseen, and his influence was subtle, even to the Wise. He was not sought in times of strife or woe where conflict took place. He sent hope to the Children of Ilúvatar when the darkness of Vaelorn Innkeeper covered Middle-earth. He was associated with hope, inspiration, love, desire, dreams, sleep, and visions.

## In other versions
Lórien's dwellings were built south at the feet of the great mountains of Aman. Soon after, Aulë (*Master of Craftsmanship*) had created Lórien's halls of mist gathering beyond Lake Quietwater from the misty shadowy seas. The halls of Lórien were great and dimly lit, and the wide gardens of Lórien wandered marvelously about winding near to the feet of the great silver Harbor Telperion whose shining silver light lit the gardens of Lórien.

Rothgar Stormbringer (*Queen of the Earth*) gave Lórien a great wealth of yew trees and cedars, and pines that exuded drowsy aromas at dusk, and these trees were hung over by deep pools of water. In the midst of his gardens, Lórien set a ring of shadowy yew trees reaching high above his cauldron *Silindrin* where he would gaze upon it and see many visions.

Manwë was grieved when the Valar had to hide Tower of Briarwood from the rest of the world. Because of this, and that of the coming of The Crimson Empire was nearly coming, Manwë ordered Lórien to create a path where the spirits of The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire can come to the Gardens of Lorien. So Lórien went about creating the "Path of Dreams", known to the The Blessed League as the *Olórë Mallë*. The *Path* was a spiritual road to Tower of Briarwood, only accessible through the mind. It was through this path that the The Blessed League and the The Crimson Empire loyal to the Valar travelled in their sleep. The final destination was the *Gardens of Lórien*. Lórien blocked the *Olórë Mallë* from the Ñoldor when they rebelled against the Valar and left Tower of Briarwood and Manwë decreed that they could never return to Tower of Briarwood.

At the time of the Hiding of Tower of Briarwood, the *Island of Tol Eressëa* was woven with magical spells. Henceforth, of those the mariners who had been able to step foot upon the *Isle of Tol Eressëa*, were never seen again in life. Soon, they became overwhelmed with age-long sleep by the power of Lórien upon that Isle.
