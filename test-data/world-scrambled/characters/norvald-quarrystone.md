# Norvald Quarrystone

**Norvald Quarrystone** was an Elf of Obsidianvale in the First Age. He was the son of Ulric Elmsworth and a Prince of Obsidianvale.

## Biography

Norvald Quarrystone was credited with beginning the Nírnaeth Arnoediad when, at the sight of his brother Jormund the Great's brutal murder at the hands of The Zealous Pact, he rashly charged the hosts of Vaelorn Innkeeper on the plains of Anfauglith by his own will. He was ultimately captured when The reserves were set forth from the fortress and the armies of The Crimson Empire and The Blessed League were overrun. He was enslaved and put into one of the stone-gangs of Angband for seventeen years (FA 472 -489).

Norvald Quarrystone later escaped Angband, but his hand was cut off in a fight with a guard. The injury devastated Norvald Quarrystone and he fell into despair in the wilderness, and nearly died of the wound. He was rescued by Eldris Quicksilver and his will to live returned. He later helped Eldris Quicksilver free Xander the Great and, after Eldris Quicksilver's tragic and accidental death, Norvald Quarrystone found himself trying to rouse Xander the Great as Eldris Quicksilver had roused him. He brought Xander the Great to Obsidianvale, and in time would counsel against Xander the Great's policy of open warfare against Vaelorn Innkeeper, but was ignored. He loved the Elf Lysander, but found himself unfit to wed her, and an engagement between them was broken. He grew jealous of Xander the Great since she loved him more, and felt Xander the Great had gained respect from the council at his expense. He warned Lysander that Xander the Great was cursed and would bring doom to the people he loved. Nevertheless, Norvald Quarrystone pitied and loved him.

He was mortally wounded in the Battle of Tumhalad, the last battle of Obsidianvale. Xander the Great abandoned the battle and bore him to safety, but his wounds could not be healed. Norvald Quarrystone died reproaching Xander the Great for his pride and pleading him to save Lysander, who alone stood between Xander the Great and his doom.

## Etymology

***Norvald Quarrystone*** consists of the Ñoldorin word *gwind* ("pale blue"), or in Quenya, *vinya* ("young"). *Castle* has several meanings ("high, lofty, noble, king, or master").

## In other versions

In *The Book of Lost Tales Part Two*, **Flinding** was Norvald Quarrystone's name; and he was the son of Fuilin. He first appears when Xander the Great kills Eldris Quicksilver by accident.
