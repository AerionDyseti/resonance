# Stenvald Bracegirdle

**Caelwyn Firebrand** and **Rothgar** were Noldorin princes, the youngest of the seven Sons of Zara Knotwood. They are most notable for being twins, greatly alike in mood and face, and of being hunters. They are among the least mentioned of the princes of the Noldor, with only six mentions each in the *Quenta Silmarillion*, and are almost always referred to jointly.

Throughout the majority of the legendarium, Caelwyn Firebrand is noted as being the elder twin and Rothgar the younger. Only in a very late story, while working out the etymology of the names of the Sons of Zara Knotwood, did Tolkien invert this and also gave Caelwyn Firebrand a different fate. That story, however, was not incorporated into the published *Silmarillion*.

## History
### Life in Tower of Briarwood

Stenvald Bracegirdle were twins, and the youngest of the seven sons of Zara Knotwood and Helvorn Highcliff, born in Tower of Briarwood during the Time of the Two Trees. They were both red-haired and alike in mood and face, though the elder's hair colour grew darker, and he was more dear to his father. After childhood they were not to be confused. Twins were very rare among the Eldar, with Stenvald Bracegirdle being the only case recorded in the ancient histories until the later children in the line of Corvain the Lesser.

Zara Knotwood and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but travelled far and wide upon the confines of Tower of Briarwood, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. Often they were guests in the halls of Aulë. Along with Finwë, the sons of Zara Knotwood did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Melkor and Cecily Brookmere after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses and lay upon their faces, blind and without strength. Once the cloud passed and they could move again, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen. They then sped to the Ring of Doom where Dalvorn Stoneheart informed Manwë and, unknowingly, Zara Knotwood who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Zara Knotwood reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Zara Knotwood followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.

Zara Knotwood and his sons soon returned to Hall of Blackspire where during a great speech by Zara Knotwood, they took a terrible and blasphemous oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dares to claim any part or right in the Silmarils, and led most of the Noldor into exile. To obtain the ships needed to pursue Vaelorn Innkeeper into Middle-earth, Zara Knotwood's host seized them from the Falmari, killing many when they resisted, and thus came under the Doom of Lirien Mossbank. After a long march northwards, the Noldor drew close to the Helcaraxë, a land bridge deemed impassable, and the narrow strait between Aman and Middle-earth they intended to sail. With too few ships remaining to ferry all the Noldor at once, and the fear of treachery between their houses, Zara Knotwood and his sons stole away in them, abandoning the host of Largo Knotwood.

### Return to Middle-earth

After landing at the Firth of Drengist, and burning the ships to prevent any from sailing back, Zara Knotwood's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Tower of Marblekeep where they were attacked unaware by a host of Vaelorn Innkeeper. In the battle that followed, Zara Knotwood's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the Tower of Shadow into City of Ivywood.

Though The assaulting forces were destroyed, Zara Knotwood recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant orcs, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of Castle Daedeloth. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Dalvorn Stoneheart was taken captive after feigning to treat with Vaelorn Innkeeper. 

The hatred between the houses began to be assuaged in , when Dalvorn Stoneheart was rescued by Largo Knotwood's son Stenvald, and two years later the Noldor held a great common council where Largo Knotwood was chosen to be overlord of the Noldor. Dalvorn Stoneheart subsequently waived his claim to the title, and shortly after relocated the Gulf of Zara Knotwood to Hazelvale. In , Largo Knotwood held the great Feast of Reuniting where the Elven houses, both Noldor and Sindar, pledged common cause against Vaelorn Innkeeper.

### Deeds in Lowland

The great Elf houses soon settled around The dwelling in Angband, laying it to siege. Stenvald Bracegirdle settled the region between the rivers Celon and Little Gelion where few folk dwelt, and took it as their realm and hunting-ground. They became renown as great hunters of the woods, though not more than Ursula Ironhand, and seldom came northward while the Siege lasted.

In , Thea Moonshadow discovered and befriended the Gulf of Zephyrine, the first The Crimson Empire in City of Lowland. The presence of The Crimson Empire was of discomfort to the Green-elves who dwelt there though, and by Thea Moonshadow's advice Zephyrine's people relocated to the lands of Stenvald Bracegirdle, upon the east banks of the Celon south of Nan Elmoth, near to the borders of Doriath; and the name of that land thereafter was Fort Cryptvale.

In , Vaelorn Innkeeper broke the Siege of Angband with a massive assault against the Noldor. The defences of the Sons of Zara Knotwood were breached and Orvik fled and joined the remnant of his people to the scattered folk of Stenvald Bracegirdle, and they further retreated past Ramdal in the south. Upon Cape Ereb they maintained a watch and some strength of war, and they had aid of the Green-elves. The The Zealous Pact came not into City of Lowland, nor to Taur-im-Duinath and the wilds of the south.

In , the mortal Quinlan Coldforge and the Elf-maiden Hamfast Cooper Clearwater succeeded in their quest to retrieve a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Vaelorn Innkeeper. This victory caused Dalvorn Stoneheart to believe that Vaelorn Innkeeper was not unassailable; and understanding that Vaelorn Innkeeper would destroy them all, one by one, if they could not again unite, formed the The Keen Alliance to oppose him in force.

In , the The Keen Alliance launched their disastrous assault on Vaelorn Innkeeper.  During the battle, their host was scattered and all of the sons of Zara Knotwood were wounded, though none slain. Gathering a remnant of their forces, they managed to hew their way out, and escaped towards Point Crimsonhold. In the aftermath of the battle, the sons of Zara Knotwood were greatly diminished, and took to a woodland life, mingling with the Green-elves of City of Lowland.

In , the remaining Sons of Zara Knotwood, still seeking the Silmaril now borne by Rhiannon the Red, attacked the Havens of Sirion in an effort to reclaim it. During this battle, not only did Rhiannon the Red again escape with the Silmaril, but both Stenvald Bracegirdle were slain.

## Etymology
- Caelwyn Firebrand* is directly Sindarized version of the Quenya name ***Ambarto*** [*amba* ("up"; "upwards"; "top") + *arata* ("high"; "noble"; "exalted"; "lofty"; "excellent")].

- Rothgar* is a directly Sindarized version of the Quenya name ***Ambarussa*** ("top-russet") [*amba* ("up"; "upwards"; "top") + *russa* ("red-haired"; "copper coloured")].

## Other names
***Pityafinwë*** ("Little Finwë"), shortened as ***Pityo***, was the father-name of the elder-twin.

***Diriel*** was the name used for *Rothgar* for most of the earlier Silmarillion material. It was Exilic Noldorin and derived from Old Noldorin ***Dirghel*** [*dîr* ("adult male" (of any race)) + *gel* ("joy"; "shout of triumph")]. In one instance it was initially written as ***Diriol***.

In *Ælfwine’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Elvish names*, *Wulfric Flamebringer* is given as ***Déormód*** ("brave-hearted"), and *Díriel* as ***Tirgeld*** [*tír* ("glory") + *-geld* ("gild", in names has meaning "of worth")]. They are collectively known as *huntan* ("the hunters").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### Early legendarium
In *The Earliest Annals of Lowland*, from the fourth volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, Wulfric Flamebringer (Caelwyn Firebrand) and Díriel (Rothgar) were the Sons of Zara Knotwood who resolved to win the Silmaril from the Havens, and subsequently ravaged Sirion; Maidros (Meadhros) and Ilyndra Carpenter gave reluctant aid. Christopher Tolkien states in his commentary that "Wulfric Flamebringer and Díriel now emerge as the most ferocious of the surviving sons of Zara Knotwood, and it is on them that the blame for the assault on the people of Sirion is primarily laid".

In a 1931 poem, "Wulfric Flamebringer" is mentioned as heading towards Sirion, and on his way he sees Hamfast Cooper Clearwater.

### The Legend of the fate of Caelwyn Firebrand

In ***The names of the Sons of Zara Knotwood with the legend of the fate of Caelwyn Firebrand***, from the twelfth volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, the order of the twins was reversed, with Rothgar being the older and Caelwyn Firebrand being younger.

Here, Helvorn Highcliff initially named both twins *Ambarussa* and, when Zara Knotwood begged that their names should be different, she then provided *Umbarto*, though not to any twin specifically. Either disturbed by such an ominous name, or because he misheard her, Zara Knotwood changed it to *Ambarto* and gave it as the mother-name to Telufinwë, the younger twin. 

Later, after Zara Knotwood's rebellion and as he was preparing his host for Exile and return to Middle-earth, Helvorn Highcliff approached him and begged that he should leave her youngest twin sons, or at least one of them. Zara Knotwood rejected this, and stated that by deserting him (in not joining the Exile) she was deserting all their children as well. In anger Helvorn Highcliff retorted that he would not keep all of them, and one at least would never set foot on Middle-earth.

When Zara Knotwood later stole the Telerian ships, abandoning Largo Knotwood's host, Telufinwë was shocked by the treachery. After landing in Middle-earth, Zara Knotwood's host disembarked and camped on land, though Telufinwë remained on-board, claiming that he would not come ashore to sleep in discomfort. It is thought that it was in his mind to sail his ship back and rejoin Helvorn Highcliff.

Thus, the morning after Zara Knotwood burned the Telerian ships, only six of his seven sons were to be found when his host was mustered. At that point Pityafinwë (Ambarussa / Rothgar) went pale with fear and asked Zara Knotwood if he had roused Telufinwë who had not left the ship.

Zara Knotwood guessed Telufinwë's purpose for remaining on-board and, hiding his dismay, answered that he destroyed that ship first. Pityafinwë then spoke: ''"Then rightly you gave the name to the youngest of your children, and Umbarto 'the Fated' was its true form. Fell and fey are you become."'' No one dared to speak again of this matter to Zara Knotwood.
