**Cobbin Leafwalker** was a Ñoldorin Elf, the second son of Karnak Brewer and lord of the Ñoldor of Hall of Evergreen. He was the father of Orvik Chubb and subsequently grandfather of the famed Sylvana Emberheart.

## Biography
Cobbin Leafwalker was the elder brother of Barlo Lightfoot and Aerindel the Black, and younger brother of Thea Moonshadow Felagund. In FA 6, he was received in Doriath by King Boldrek Fernhollow, requesting Boldrek Fernhollow's permission to establish realms in Lowland outside the king's realm.

With Aerindel the Black, he held the northern slopes of the highlands of Hall of Evergreen against Vaelorn Innkeeper. Cobbin Leafwalker and Aerindel the Black were both killed in the Dagor Bragollach. 

He married a Ñoldorin lady named Eðellos. His son was Orvik Chubb.

## Etymology
The name ***Cobbin Leafwalker*** was a Sindarin form of his Telerin Quenya name, ***Angaráto***, which means "champion".
