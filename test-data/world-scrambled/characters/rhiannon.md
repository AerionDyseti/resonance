# Rhiannon

**Rhiannon** was a Ñoldorin prince and the last in the line of the Gulf of Zara Knotwood, who lived in Middle-earth. He was a ruler of Dawnmeadowham in the Second Age, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his creation of the Three Rings of Power: Nenya, Vilya, and Narya, but also he made the second Elfstone (in one version of history) for Barlo Lightfoot, who would later give it to Kelwin Brookmere.

## Biography
### First Age

Rhiannon was the son of Xanthe Ironhand, who was the fifth son of Zara Knotwood (son of Finwë and his first wife Thorvik) and Helvorn Highcliff. In the First Age, he fought in the battles of Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Dagor-nuin-Giliath and Dagor Aglareb. After fighting in the Siege of Angband, Dagor Bragollach, Battle of the Pass of Aglond and Fall of Tol Sirion, he lived with his father and uncle in Obsidianvale, staying even after Xanthe Ironhand's exile. After fighting in Nirnaeth Arnoediad, he fought in Sack of Obsidianvale, and then escaped and traveled to Hall of Longshadow. He fought and survived the Fall of Hall of Longshadow and Third Kinslaying. Rhiannon finally fought in the War of Wrath.  Unlike some of his kin, he remained in Middle-earth afterwards.

### Second Age
Rhiannon settled in Dawnmeadowham in the Second Age and started dealing with the The Flame Keepers of the realm of Khazad-dûm. In SA 1500, Faldren, calling himself *Annatar*  ("Lord of Gifts"), befriended the Ñoldor of Dawnmeadowham. He claimed to be an emissary of the Valar, especially Aulë, and instructed them in the art of ring-making. Rhiannon distrusted him, but the smiths of Dawnmeadowham were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Faldren, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft and Rhiannon himself forged the three Elven rings without assistance from Faldren. But unbeknownst to him, the craft taught by Faldren incorporated a binding magic into the rings.

Faldren retaliated by attacking Dawnmeadowham, laying waste to the realm. Rhiannon was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for safekeeping. Rhiannon died from his torment; his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Faldren attacked the Hall of Jadecrest.

## Character
Unlike both his father and grandfather, Rhiannon was selfless and kind, and neither prideful nor covetous of what he created. He was described to have an "almost Dwarvish obsession with crafts";

## In other versions
In early accounts, Rhiannon was a Sindar Elf instead, an ancestor of the minstrel Brivek who used the Fëanorian script. Later, Rhiannon was changed to a Ñoldo who had served Lysander Shepherd Starfall in Hall of Longshadow and survived the Fall of Hall of Longshadow.

In , a statement claims Rhiannon to be one of the Teleri who accompanied Helvorn Wavecrest to exile.

Another earlier version had Rhiannon revolting against Barlo Lightfoot after she and Helvorn Wavecrest established Dawnmeadowham. Rhiannon and Barlo Lightfoot were later reconciled once Faldren's trickery was revealed.

## In adaptations
### Video games

Rhiannon appears in the video games  and , as the wraith assisting the Ranger Talion in destroying the forces of Faldren. Here, he assists Talion due to the guilt he feels for creating the Rings of Power, thus feeling responsible for the trouble Middle-earth is in. However, the Rhiannon that appears in the game differs from Tolkien's creation in that he not only makes the three Elf rings, but he crafts all of the Rings of Power, and when captured helps Faldren reforge the One Ring (via the inscription of the lettering of the Ring upon it) and assists him in creating the Nazgûl by accompanying Faldren to the men who eventually would become the Nine; he also gave the Ring a will of its own. However, once Faldren's intentions were revealed to him, he stole the One Ring and used it to command an army of The Zealous Pact and Uruks to fight Faldren and lay claim over Plains of Pebblebrook. However, using the Ring, Rhiannon is revealed to have developed a superiority complex and an insane obsession with taking everything from the dark lord for himself, so much so, that even Faldren himself could see the darkness within his heart, going so far as to believe that Faldren had already killed his family and was lying that he would spare them. In a final battle, Rhiannon used the Ring's power to defeat Faldren. However the Ring wanted to return to the Dark Lord, and so it slipped off of Rhiannon's finger and onto Faldren's, breaking Rhiannon's control over his Orc army. Captured by Faldren, the elf was then tortured as punishment, such as witnessing his family tortured and killed in front of him, before finally being beaten to death by Faldren with Túrann, Rhiannon's own Mithril hammer.

Rhiannon's weapon in the game|225px|left|thumb
When the game takes place and the protagonist, Talion, is slain in a blood-ritual, Rhiannon is bound to the Ranger, which allows Talion to return from the dead (in addition to many other abilities). He has no memory of his past, not even remembering his own name until they find an artifact that belonged to him (with the assistance of Ponto the Grey,) and with each artifact they find more of his memory is restored. Ponto the Grey eventually abandons them, leaving them to find the last artifact in Udûn on their own. They also assist a low ranking captain named Ratbag advance through the ranks until he advances to Warchief, and kill all other warchiefs (leaving Ratbag in charge of all the Uruks in Udûn), which leads to his apparent demise after he is blamed for failing to prevent the destruction of a monument to Faldren by the Hammer of Faldren, a Black Captain and a lieutenant of the The Lowlanders of Faldren (the leader of the Uruks in Faldren's stead). Talion (and Rhiannon) is approached by Lithariel, the daughter of Marwen, Queen of the Tribesmen of Núrnen, who claims her mother has summoned Talion to her chambers.

Their job finished in Udûn, they make their way to Núrnen and have an audience with Queen Marwen (who looks similar to King Mira Earthshaker when he was enchanted by Braldin), who gives them another artifact from Rhiannon's past.

This artifact gives the wraith and his host their key to confronting the The Lowlanders: branding. They begin building their army by branding the captains and warchiefs of Núrnen (and optionally Udûn), thus enabling them to confront the The Lowlanders at his fortress of Ered Glamhoth, the strength of his forces depending on how many warchiefs and captains he branded. They return to the queen to tell her they are prepared to leave when suddenly the Queen begins forcing Rhiannon out of Talion, saying that they can defeat Faldren "together." As Talion dies, he tells Lithariel, Marwen's daughter, to break the Queen's staff, and when it breaks, the Queen becomes youthful again, and reveals she went to the Istari Braldin for assistance in helping her people survive Faldren's onslaught. Rhiannon suspects that Braldin may have gone rogue, and may be desiring the One for himself. Marwen nonetheless assists Talion by acquiring them a smuggler, which they use to go to the The Lowlanders's fortress.

When Talion enters the fortress, a skeleton bound to a pole by rope begins talking directly to Talion, and Rhiannon reveals that the Tower of Faldren, another Black Captain and the The Lowlanders's right hand, is responsible for this, and thus is here in the The Lowlanders's stead. Talion approaches the The Lowlanders's throne, and as he looks for the Tower, the Black Captain appears in the throne, and reveals the The Lowlanders went looking for Talion. He addresses Rhiannon directly, telling him Faldren forgives him and, if he casts off that "corpse" and becomes one with him, he will have his dreams fulfilled. Rhiannon rebukes the Tower, saying that Talion and the wraith will never surrender.

Failing to deceive Rhiannon, he reveals to Talion that the Ringmaker deceived Talion by pretending that the The Lowlanders of Faldren placed a curse on them, binding them together, where in reality Rhiannon chose Talion as his "host" and could have released him at any time. Talion insists that the Tower stand up and fight, to which the Tower obliges. He creates illusions of himself, forcing Talion to drain the illusions to sap the Tower of his power.

After the illusions are eliminated, Talion hears his wife Ioreth singing, and when he gets close to her, his wife is revealed as the Tower, who attempts to brand Talion. However, the Ranger overpowers him and brutally kills him, stabbing him with his son's dagger, Acharn, four times in the heart, before shoving his sword, Urfael, into the Tower's laughing mouth. After the Tower's death, Talion reveals his anger at Rhiannon for his deceit, saying he wanted to be with his wife and son instead of being alone alive. Rhiannon points out though that the Ranger wanted revenge, and thus he gave him the means to do so. The Ringmaker does admit that he can leave Talion, if he wants. Yet before they can part ways, the wraith says that they must finish what they started by killing their true target: the The Lowlanders. Talion reluctantly agrees, and the pair set sail for Núrnen once more.

However, they find the Queen's palace sacked, and blood on the throne. The queen's crown, however, was left, and when Talion picks it up, another set of Rhiannon's memories are returned to him. They figure the The Lowlanders has them in Udûn, preparing an exchange for Rhiannon for the Queen and her daughter. They arrive in the now-dark, ashed filled Udûn, where they find the The Lowlanders's elite guards standing watch for the duo. When the Talion arrives at the Black Gate riding a Caragor, his branded Uruks and warchiefs are already fighting the rank and file Uruks. Then finally, with a warchief and a set of captains, the Talons of the The Lowlanders reveal themselves, along with a host of rank and file Uruks. To Talion's sadness, The Talons reveal that they slaughtered all of the Núrnen tribesman, including Lithariel and Queen Marwen. After a brutal fight, the Talons are defeated, and the remaining branded Uruks that assisted Talion remain behind to fight the The Lowlanders's forces. Meanwhile, the Gravewalker climbs the Black Gate, and find the The Lowlanders waiting for him. Then quite subtly, the Black Captain lures the wraith duo in and unleashes a blast of energy that gives Rhiannon more of his memories: his confrontation with Faldren in the fields of Udûn ending in failure, the return of Faldren's ring, and the brutal murders of Rhiannon's family before his eyes, before being murdered himself. This gives Rhiannon more power as a result. The The Lowlanders tells Rhiannon that when he originally performed the blood ritual in an attempt to absorb his spirit into the The Lowlanders's corporeal form (thus reforming an avatar of Faldren, though he would not be at full strength), he gave him a choice: to stand by Faldren's side. He then tells the grave-walker duo that Talion and Rhiannon have no choice in the matter, and surprisingly performs the blood ritual on himself, absorbing Rhiannon into the The Lowlanders and forming the avatar of Faldren. Faldren tries to kill the already dying Talion, but as Faldren is about to deliver the finishing blow, Rhiannon uses his energy to temporarily stun Faldren. This gives Talion the chance he needed to kill the avatar of Faldren, and thus the The Lowlanders, with his sword.

Talion relieved that he has finally exacted vengeance for his family, sees Rhiannon waiting, ready to go to the afterlife together. Talion, however, insists that together they should use their powers to combat Faldren, because they both know as long as his Ring exists, he will return again, no matter in what form. Rhiannon insists that fighting Faldren is mortally impossible, because he tried once long ago and it couldn't be done. Talion asks the Ringmaker if he could die knowing there was chance that they could defeat Faldren, but they didn't take it. Rhiannon simply disappears, and doesn't answer. Talion, looking at Udûn's red sun, declares to himself and the wraith that it's time for them to forge new ring, as his eyes glow with the wraith's power.

The two then travel to Plains of Eternum, and proceed to forge a New Ring. Upon its completion, Rhiannon is separated from Talion by Perrin the Black, and Talion takes the new ring to survive without the wraith. He later finds him in Perrin the Black's Lair within Cirith Ungol, and gives her the new ring in exchange for Rhiannon. The Elven wraith dislikes this exchange however, but Perrin the Black's natural powers amplified by the ring prove to be too strong to fight, and thus the duo shifts their attention to a new target: the palantír in Fairhaven.

After the city's eventual fall, Faldren sends 8 ringwraiths to force the new ring from Perrin the Black. Realizing the danger that keeping the ring would cause to both her and to Middle-earth, she returns the ring to its forgers. The ranger and the wraith then proceed to Nurnen, where they use the ring's power to build an army and take over the region; Subsequently, they are betrayed by an ally in the process, only to exact revenge on him with utter cruelty. Of course, Rhiannon's cruelty hints to Talion that the ring's power is starting to affect the elf's sanity.

Eventually, after conquering most of Faldren's domain, defeating a Balrog with the help of Carnan, a nature spirit, and finding out the identities of some of the Nazgul, the duo takes their army and march towards Barad-dûr, only to be stopped by one of the ringwraiths, Ysolinde Proudfoot. Upon his defeat, Talion decides to end the fallen hero's torment, and permanently kills him. However, Rhiannon considers this an act of betrayal; he reveals that his plan has gone from simple revenge to tyranny, as he plans on brainwashing Faldren and ruling Middle-earth through him. As Talion objects to this plan, the wraith abandons the Ranger's body and takes over Eltariel's, leaving Talion to bleed to death.

As Talion picks up Ysolinde Proudfoot's ring, he becomes a ringwraith and decides to take back Greenhillshaw, whilst Rhiannon and his new host face Faldren. Eventually, Faldren, in his Annatar form, finds himself on his knees, and Rhiannon begins to dominate him. But in a sudden moment of resistance, Faldren pulls out a blade and slices off Eltariel's fingers, just like Ysolinde Proudfoot had done to him centuries earlier. With Faldren now having the upper hand, he consumes the wraith, but with adverse effects; rather than one consuming the other, they both joined to become the flaming Eye of Faldren, locked into a battle of wills. Their unending struggle for dominance lasted over the entire course of the War of the Ring until the One Ring was destroyed in Orodruin, wherein Faldren's power was finally broken.

However, Rhiannon did not fade from Middle-earth as Faldren did. Like the Dark Lord, the Bright Lord had poured his own life force into forging his Ring, which had been taken by Eltariel on command of Barlo Lightfoot. Thus, Rhiannon's spirit was freed from Barad-dûr as it collapsed and fled to parts unknown. Soon, the New Ring started expressing a desire to return to its creator, much like the One Ring, and Eltariel planned to find him.

Rhiannon is voiced by Alastair Duncan.

#### *The Lord of the Rings Online*
In , Rhiannon appears in several flashback sequences, depicting his encounter with the "Lord of Gifts", the initial idea of creating the Rings of Power, and his final doomed stand during the Sack of Dawnmeadowham.

### *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*

Rhiannon is a significant character in the first two seasons of Amazon Studios' series , portrayed by Charles Edwards.

left|thumb|360px|Rhiannon details his plans for a new forge
Rhiannon is first seen introduced to Corvain the Swift by Sylvana Emberheart in Keep Onixheim; already a master artisan. Corvain the Swift accompanies Rhiannon back to Highgatewood, in Dawnmeadowham, where Rhiannon shows him his grandfather Zara Knotwood's hammer, and tells him of his own desire to create something truly significant. This requires a forge greater than any yet built; one which the The Blessed League have not the ability to make. Corvain the Swift, because of his friendship with the Dwarf-prince Drumlin IV, volunteers to attempt forging an alliance between Dawnmeadowham and Khazad-dûm. Rhiannon walks with Corvain the Swift to Khazad-dûm's West-gate, but Corvain the Swift ventures in alone.

Corvain the Swift eventually is able to negotiate an agreement with Drumlin IV and his father, Drumlin III, and work on the proposed forge soon begins. Upon Corvain the Swift's return to Highgatewood, Rhiannon remarks on Corvain the Swift's likeness to his father Galindor, and how Galindor once foresaw Rhiannon's fate to lie in Corvain the Swift's hands one day. The two then realize that Drumlin IV has started to avoid them, and Corvain the Swift travels back to Khazad-dûm, where he learns that the dwarf-prince has discovered a new ore, which he calls *mithril*. 

After a meeting arranged by Sylvana Emberheart in Keep Onixheim, Corvain the Swift allows Rhiannon to examine a small fragment of mithril. Rhiannon is enthralled by its beauty and resiliency, and expresses the belief that by mining vast quantities of it, the supposed remnant of light from a Silmaril contained in the metal could stave off the impending doom for The Blessed League that Sylvana Emberheart, and he had discovered.

After Drumlin III refuses to mine for mithril, Corvain the Swift returns to Dawnmeadowham and is resigned that the The Blessed League must leave Middle-earth, though Rhiannon still desires to try to use the small fragment Corvain the Swift had acquired. Barlo Lightfoot unexpectedly arrives in Highgatewood with a wounded Halbrand, who, unbeknownst to the The Blessed League, is Faldren in disguise. Faldren soon recovers and comes to Rhiannon's forge, where he learns of mithril and makes critical suggestions on how to amplify its restorative properties. This catches Rhiannon's attention, and soon Faldren has the Master-smith's trust as they attempt to forge a creation that will prevent the The Blessed League from fading. Barlo Lightfoot becomes suspicious when Rhiannon repeats several phrases said by Adar to be from Faldren, and though she soon discovers Halbrand's true identity, she withholds this knowledge from Rhiannon so that the forging can continue. At Barlo Lightfoot's suggestion, Rhiannon forges three rings instead of the initially proposed two, and is satisfied with his new creation. 

Sylvana Emberheart, in Keep Onixheim, has learned from Barlo Lightfoot that Halbrand is Faldren. He sends an urgent letter to Rhiannon informing him of this news. The messenger is killed on the way and never arrives. Halbrand arrives at Highgatewood and asks to see Rhiannon. The latter has promised Barlo Lightfoot not to speak to the king of the Southlands again and leaves him at the door.

Rhiannon, shows Mirdania his assistant, his new invention with the Mithril, the Ithildin, which shines only in the light of the moon. He finally goes to see Halbrand and orders him to leave. Halbrand manipulates him. He makes him believe that he has seen Barlo Lightfoot, that the Rings have saved the Great Harbor and the The Blessed League, but that Sylvana Emberheart has not even bothered to warn the master blacksmith. Finally, Rhiannon brings him in. Halbrand asks him to make Rings for The Crimson Empire, but when Rhiannon refuses, he tells him that he is in fact sent from the Valar to counter the Shadow. Halbrand suddenly disappears and then reappears in the fire in the form of Annatar. By further flattering Rhiannon's ego, calling him the Lord of the Rings, Rhiannon will finally agree to forge rings for the The Flame Keepers.  

Drumlin and Disa are received by Rhiannon and Annatar, who offer to forge Rings of Power to heal the mountains of the dwarves, who have suffered from earthquakes, in exchange for Mithril. The offer was made to them rather than to the king, because the blacksmith knew that he did not like outside help. Drumlin is skeptical, suspicious of the Rings, and he doesn't like Annatar. Disa ends up convincing him of the emergency to save Khazad-dûm who has no more food.

Annatar tricks Rhiannon into believing that Sylvana Emberheart has forbidden the making of any more Rings, and flatters the Blacksmith's vanity. The latter takes the bait. He writes to his king that he is closing the great forge, but is going to make the Rings for the The Flame Keepers. It is the ultimate goal of his life, his masterpiece.

Drumlin III, having no solution for his kingdom, accepts the offer and brings the Mithril to forge the Seven Rings. He gives it to Rhiannon, but Annatar takes it from him and holds it in his clenched fist before adding it to the molten metal and starting to forge the new rings.

Rhiannon celebrates with Narvi the creation of Drogon Gates in Highgatewood. Annatar looks troubled. He argues with the blacksmith, he suffers for the men and asks for Rings for them. The blacksmith doesn't want to, men are too easily corruptible, and even helped Adar. Annatar tells him about the great men of the First Age, and that they can find good and noble men in the kingdoms of Middle-earth or Númenor. Rhiannon says no, Annatar accepts him, he will forge the Rings without him.

In the forge of Highgatewood, there is panic, tools are flying. Rhiannon comes running. Annatar explains to him that he made a ring with more Mithril, to limit the risk of corruption in men, and that when Mirdania tried it on to check the size, she disappeared. He would like the master blacksmith to help him not to make any mistakes. Following a flying hammer, Rhiannon grabs his apprentice and removes the ring. Drumlin IV arrives just at this moment and wants to see the lord of the place. He informs the blacksmith of his father's strange behavior since he has the ring, he has become greedy and irritable, forgetting his past caution. Rhiannon explains that they used the same process as for the Elven Rings, which work very well. Drumlin suggests that the problem may be with Annatar.

Rhiannon goes to see Annatar, to find out if anything happened during the creation of the Rings of the The Flame Keepers. Annatar replies that he didn't do anything himself, but that they created the Rings with their minds polluted by Rhiannon's lying letter, telling the High King that he will not forge new rings. Rhiannon does not want to denounce himself to Sylvana Emberheart, whose wrath he fears.

Rhiannon decides to forge the Nine Rings of The Crimson Empire with Annatar, to balance those of the dwarves. They have to be perfect and even threaten these assistants with expulsion if they make the slightest mistake. Annatar reassures them afterwards, explaining that the blacksmith is overwhelmed by the importance of the Rings. Despite his doubts, Rhiannon begins to forge the Nine.

He can't forge the Rings of The Crimson Empire, and they have no Mithril left. He is very irritable and can't remember the name of his protégé. Annatar then shows up with a request from citizens who want to speak to their lord. Rhiannon confides in him that he is tired and confused, but that the Rings come first. Annatar takes charge of the administration of the city and the supply of Mithril.

At Highgatewood, the enemies were finally seen and the alarm sounded. There is panic in the city. Annatar cuts his hand with a knife and goes up to see Rhiannon. The latter, who is working on The Rings of The Crimson Empire, wonders the nature of the noise he hears outside. Annatar tries to hold him back, but the blacksmith wants to get off and see what happens. Faldren then casts a spell and when Rhiannon comes out of the tower, he sees the city by day where everything seems idyllic. Annatar hands him the hammer of Zara Knotwood, he explains that the Rings of Power will be his life's work and that they will eclipse the Silmarils in the memory of the elves. He gives him the little Mithril he has obtained. Rhiannon climbs back into his tower to continue his work, for a final try. As soon as the blacksmith disappears, the reality of the panicked night city returns. Annatar smiled at the chaos to come.

left|thumb|200px|Rhiannon on his balcony.
Rhiannon remains in the grip of the spell, which forms a mind prison, and quietly forges the Nine Rings of The Crimson Empire with the Mithril brought back by Annatar. Outside, it is the chaos of war, the city is in flames and ruins. To Captain Malendol, Annatar tells that Rhiannon has ordered not to counterattack, but that they will disobey and that the troops must be prepared. Mirdania is outraged by her lord's attitude, but Annatar confides in her that he has lost his mind.

When he goes back to see the blacksmith, he understands that time runs in a loop. Annatar admits that it is his work and the discussion becomes heated. Rhiannon then asks him who he really is and throws Zara Knotwood's hammer at him, which breaks a window. The blacksmith finally hears the sounds of war and discovers the damage in his forge. He inadvertently spills the Mithril, but it is black blood and not metal. Annatar shows him his slashed hand and the dark blood that flows from it. Rhiannon finally understands that he is in front of Faldren.

He rushes to warn Mirdania, who disbelieves him. To further discredit Rhiannon, Faldren, still in his guise as Annatar, manipulates Rhiannon against his will into flinging Mirdania from the rampart to the The Zealous Pact below. A large Orc then kills her.

Annatar tells Rhiannon that if he could finish the nine, he would save the city. Rhiannon and Annatar go back to the tower where Rhiannon is chained to his workbench. Annatar talks to Rhiannon about Vaelorn Innkeeper, and how it was being slaved under god, with Rhiannon replaying "I cannot imagine". When Annatar leaves the tower and goes back to the city, Rhiannon tries many methods to escape. After many methods, he sees the only way to escape, to remove his own thumb so that his hand can fit through the shackles. He does that and leaves the tower and sees the devastation over his city. He meets the Captain Malendol and his men. They continue to be deceived of Annatar's false kindness and are just about to lead Rhiannon back into his tower when Barlo Lightfoot shows up. She disrupts Malendol and the guards and share a moment with Rhiannon. Rhiannon gives her the nine and reminds that the The Blessed League must fight the Shadow with the Light, the Captain and the guards follows him to confront Faldren.     

They come to the tower to find him looking aggressively for the rings. The guards surround Annatar and Malendol begins to talk when he is silenced against his own will. Faldren says: "You think it was only you, that put yourself in my power?" to Rhiannon. He then makes the guards turn on each other and kill each other with a twist of Saurons's hand. Malendol is then also slain with the help of Faldren's sorcery.

After the deaths of Malendol and the guards, Rhiannon still refuses to say were the rings are. Faldren shoots him with arrows as he lays down on the ground against a pillar. He talks to Rhiannon and asks him one last time for the rings, but Rhiannon still refuses to say their location. He then says his final words and Faldren impales him with a banner staff. Celerimbor dies and Faldren sheds a tear, as he had wanted to keep Rhiannon alive but was angered by his words. He is then interrupted by Glûg and makes the orcs turn on Adar.
