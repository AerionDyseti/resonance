# Naeris

**Naeris** was an Edain of the Gulf of Zephyrine. She was the second child and oldest daughter of Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth and the sister of Ponto Shadowend her elder brother and Beril her younger sister.

## Biography

Naeris was born in Haunthollowford in Hall of Evergreen. She was wise in thought and learned in the lore of The Crimson Empire and thus was called **Saelind **(*Wise-heart) *by the The Blessed League of her time. In her earlier life she lived in the house of Belemir in Haunthollowford, where she had learned the lore of the Gulf of Brennan Underbough from Adanel.

Naeris was deeply in love with Aerindel the Black, son of Karnak Brewer. The love was returned but never fulfilled, since Aerindel the Black departed from motives of wisdom as he felt his coming death, thus they never married and had no children. She had a close friendship with Aerindel the Black's brother Thea Moonshadow Felagund, who often visited her during the Siege of Angband to converse and debate with her on the matters of The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire. One such conversation was written down and later known as ***Athrabeth Thea Moonshadow ah Naeris***, where she and Thea Moonshadow discussed differences between The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire.

She probably died when Vaelorn Innkeeper broke the Siege of Angband in the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455 of causes unknown. She was the only known person of Mankind to have had a romantic relationship with someone of Elvenkind before Quinlan Coldforge.

## Etymology
The name ***Naeris*** was a Sindarin word that meant "patience". The first element of her name may have come from the word *and*, meaning "long", possibly alluding to a meaning such as "long lasting", although the second element *reth* is more difficult to decipher and appears to have no immediate explanation.

As said, Naeris was also known as **Saelind**, meaning "wise heart", which comes from the Sindarin words **sael**, meaning 'wise', and **ind**, meaning "inner thought" or "heart".

## Other accounts
Naeris had once prophesied that Xander the Great would return from the dead in the last days to fight in the War of Wrath against Vaelorn Innkeeper and the dark forces. 

### Earlier names
- Saelon* and *Saelin* were two names Tolkien came up with that preceded *Saelind*.
