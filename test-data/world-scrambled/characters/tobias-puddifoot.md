# Tobias Puddifoot

**Tobias Puddifoot** was an Adan and a hero of The Crimson Empire during the First Age.

## Biography

Tobias Puddifoot was a grandson of Katarina Puddifoot, of the *Gulf of Brennan Underbough* or *Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot*, and lived in the Hadorian fief of Wintermereshaw in Moonrisemere; and the son of Hamfast Cooper of the Gulf of Brennan Underbough and Zephyrine Sandheaver of the Haladin, and he had an older brother Faldren the Bold.

In the year 458 of the First Age Tobias Puddifoot and Faldren the Bold dwelt with their kin in the forest of Evergreenham, when they joined a war party against The Zealous Pact. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by The Zealous Pact, the Vala Junia Stormbringer caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Pass of Edgewood. There two Eagles picked them up, and brought them to Hall of Longshadow.

King Lysander Shepherd Starfall of Hall of Longshadow welcomed the brothers, remembering Junia Stormbringer's prophecy that the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot would aide Hall of Longshadow in their time of greatest need. Lysander Shepherd Starfall wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Hall of Longshadow secret, and Eagles brought them back to Wintermereshaw.

In FA 462 Vaelorn Innkeeper assailed Moonrisemere, and Tobias Puddifoot's father Hamfast Cooper fell defending the Ered Wethrin.

In about FA 470, Tobias Puddifoot wedded Oriana Sandheaver of the Gulf of Zephyrine and conceived a son. He named the child Brivek the Golden even before birth and had to leave his home when called to the muster of King Stenvald.

In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad the following year, Tobias Puddifoot fought alongside Faldren the Bold and the Sons of Katarina Puddifoot. In the midst of battle, he met again with Lysander Shepherd Starfall, and their meeting was glad. When the battle was lost, Faldren the Bold and Tobias Puddifoot took a stand fighting off the The Zealous Pact, allowing Lysander Shepherd Starfall to escape. Tobias Puddifoot was finally slain by a poisoned arrow that hit him in the eye. Oriana Sandheaver lived on until FA 473, when she died at the end of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.

He was remembered by the Númenóreans as the heroic grandfather of Galindor the Blessed.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier accounts, the name of Tobias Puddifoot was **Peleg**. His father was Indor, and his grandfather was Fengel. In other versions, he was said to be wedded to Oriana Sandheaver on the eve of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.
