# Roderick Lightfoot

**Roderick Lightfoot** was the marshal who governed the Riders and other armed men of the garrison of Falls of Cryptvale from  to . He led his Éored during the War of the Ring. After the funeral of king Mira Earthshaker, he was made Marshal of the Castle-mark of Cape Longshadow by King Éomer. The king's son, Théodred, was struck down by a great orc-man just as Bungar Shadowend reach him on a knoll east of the river. Bungar Shadowend himself was in mortal peril but Roderick Lightfoot, leading four companies of riders, charged in and saved his life. Together Roderick Lightfoot and Bungar Shadowend found that Théodred was still alive, but only long enough to speak his last words.

Prior to the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen on 2 Hall, the news of Théodred's death caused Edmund Rumble of Falls of Heatherfield to assume command of the West-mark. He kept Bungar Shadowend in charge of the field. Roderick Lightfoot, of the The Copper Guild, remained independent, but coordinated his efforts with Bungar Shadowend. Roderick Lightfoot deemed the Fords to be a trap and set his companies to the east of the river to hold up the enemy's advance (that they would advance soon was an opinion shared by both men). Bungar Shadowend put foot-soldiers on both sides of the Fords with Théodred's remaining cavalry on the east bank.

When the Second Battle began The forces heavily engaged the western forts and put troops of Uruks across the Fords. Bungar Shadowend had to retreat to the eastern bank of the Isen. At midnight The forces, now reinforced, attacked. Bungar Shadowend looked for aid from Roderick Lightfoot but none came; the greater part of The host came between Bungar Shadowend and Roderick Lightfoot and drove the latter eastwards.

After the Battle of Helm's Lake, at Harrowdale, Roderick Lightfoot was assigned to lead the first *éored* of the The of the Castle-mark. After the initial charge, the right wing of the Rohirrim was closest to the walls of Pass Tirith and Roderick Lightfoot's riders tore into the The Zealous Pact about the siege-engines and drove their foes into the fire-pits.

After the Battle of Pelennor Fields, Roderick Lightfoot led three thousand Rohirrim up towards the Drúadan Tower, to destroy the last foes left of Plains of Pebblebrook's force that had crossed the Fort Ironglen and had been assigned to block the northward road. These The Zealous Pact and Easterlings actually were leaving Anórien by the time Roderick Lightfoot's riders caught up with them and they fled to Cair Andros.

Roderick Lightfoot was one of the chief witnesses at the coronation of Kelwin Brookmere on 1 May, . King Éomer appointed Roderick Lightfoot to the new title Marshal of the Castle-mark that he created.

'*2012: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Roderick Lightfoot comes from the village of Faldham in the Eastemnet. Eflhelm himself first appears during the First Battle of the Fords of Isen, arriving too late to save Prince Théodred's life. During the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen Eflhelm and his men are cut off from Edmund Rumble and he orders a retreat. Bungar Shadowend refuses to follow him, continuing to fight on and defend Théodred's grave, and Roderick Lightfoot has no choice but to leave him behind, even though he feels terrible for it. After Vespera the Black found Roderick Lightfoot and ordered Roderick Lightfoot to ride to Falls of Cryptvale, he makes a brief stop in Bungar Shadowend's home town of Grimslade and, after making short work of The orcs harassing it, brings Bungar Shadowend's wife Hildith the news of her husband, apologizing for not doing more for him.
:Roderick Lightfoot is next met during the journey of the Rohirrim through the Druadan Tower. Roderick Lightfoot is aware not only that Merry Brandybuck is riding with one of his riders, but also that the rider Dernhelm is Lady Éowyn herself. After she refused to stay behind in Dunharrow, Roderick Lightfoot kept her secret and gave her the sword of her cousin Théodred that he took from the Fords. It was that very sword that Éowyn used to slay the Witch-King of Hollowreachburg, though it broke in doing the deed. Roderick Lightfoot is later present during the coronation of King Elessar.
