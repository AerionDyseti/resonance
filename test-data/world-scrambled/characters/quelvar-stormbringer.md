**Quelvar Stormbringer ex-Tiameti nor-Karasi** (called "Zafi") is a **Dragonborn Oracle** and one of the player characters in the **Keys to Perfection** campaign. Cursed with an entropic touch that causes crafted items to decay, she hides great divine power beneath the simple robes of a The Fallen Tribunal worker.

## Basic Information

- **Full Name**: Quelvar Stormbringer ex-Tiameti nor-Karasi
- **Race/Class**: Dragonborn Oracle
- **Origin**: Nomadic tribes of Quartzhelm
- **Current Caste**: The (due to curse preventing skilled work)

## Physical Description

Zafi's scales carry the distinct, silvery sheen of their Karasi lineage. Their features are sharp and proud, but their eyes hold a haunted, distant look, as if constantly seeing something beyond the material world.

They wear the simple, durable robes of the The The Fallen Tribunal, maintained with a Dragonborn's sense of pride despite being slightly worn—a result of their curse.

## Personality

- **Traits**: Stoic, Patient, Protective, Melancholy, Resolute
- **Strengths**: Lake connection to mysterious divine power, unshakeable will, quiet strength of a survivor
- **Weaknesses**: Cursed entropic touch causing item decay, haunted by past trauma, struggles to connect with others
- **Fears**: The chaotic magic of the Port of Ironvale; insecure about inability to perform skilled tasks, forcing them into simple labor
- **Motivations**: To understand their curse and the entity that bestowed it; to protect their new home and the few friends they have made

## Biography

Zafi was born to the nomadic tribes of the Erastrixian wastes, a proud child of a dying race. Like many young Dragonborn, they joined an adventuring party seeking to reclaim lost lore and honor their ancestors by walking the Way of Dragons. Their journey led them into the heart of the **Port of Ironvale**—the chaotic tears in reality that plague their homeland.

There, their party was ambushed by a **Wild Hunt**, a terrifying fey incursion from the First World. On the brink of annihilation, they were "rescued" by a being of pure shadow—a **Shade from So-el**. The Shade's touch drove off the Hunt but left a permanent mark on Zafi, imbuing them with the strange powers of an Oracle and an equally strange curse: an **entropic touch** that causes finely crafted items to slowly decay and break in their hands.

Haunted by the encounter, Zafi and the other survivors made their way to Granitekeepfell, seeking refuge from the chaos of their homeland. To secure their safety, they appealed to **The Irvek Grunthar Amun-ro**, who fast-tracked their citizenship in exchange for a future favor. When it came time for Zafi's Proving, their curse made it impossible to join a skilled Caste—unable to reliably use tools or weapons, they were inducted into the **The Fallen Tribunal**, a humble and difficult fate.

Zafi now spends their days performing simple hauling and odd jobs, their great potential and divine power hidden beneath the robes of a common worker, waiting for the day their debt to the Irvek is called in.

## Campaign History (Sessions 1-10)

### Called In by Irvek Grunthar

When the party was assembled to investigate the "miraculous" healings in the Pebblebrookburg, Zafi's debt to Irvek Grunthar was called in—the favor owed for their fast-tracked citizenship.

### The Tainted Water Investigation (Sessions 3-10)

Zafi's oracle abilities proved crucial throughout the dungeon exploration:

- Session 4: Used unseen servants to assist with storm-rated tent setup during the desert sandstorm
- Session 5: Summoned an Earth Lake during the Mirathel Burrows battle; discovered that the Slayer **cannot perceive non-living creatures**, giving the elemental tactical invisibility
- Session 6: Helped establish the secondary exit via rope climb for emergency escape
- Session 8: Summoned an Aether Lake for battlefield support against Echo Wights; later summoned a sprite to scout the shadowy fissure (immediately destroyed by shadow tendrils, confirming the Mirathel Burrows lurked beyond)

### Siphon Surge Effects

During the climactic battle (Session 10), Zafi was **blinded** by a siphon surge, hampering their effectiveness during a critical phase of the fight.

### Sensing the Rogue Inevitable (Session 10)

**Pivotal Moment**: When Dorwyn was possessed by the cursed spear, Zafi felt something drawing their attention to the golden chain in Dorwyn's pocket—the symbol of Sol. They sensed something "cold, strange, and **empty**"—distinctly different from the Long-Faced The Jade The' cold strangeness.

**DM Secret**: What Zafi sensed was the Rogue Inevitable observing through Dorwyn's eyes during the possession. Their connection to mysterious divine forces—perhaps even related to the Shade that cursed them—allowed them to detect the cosmic entity's presence, though they don't yet understand what they perceived. This thread remains active.

## Thematic Significance

Zafi embodies several key themes:

- **Hidden potential**: Great power concealed beneath humble circumstances
- **The cost of survival**: Saved from one supernatural threat, marked by another
- **Outsider perspective**: A refugee from the chaotic Erastrixian wastes navigating ordered The society
- **Divine mystery**: Their Oracle powers came from a Shade of So-el—what does this entity want?

## Items

- Holy Symbol of Sol (carried; provided spiritual countermeasure during the spear crisis)

## Connections

- **Irvek Grunthar Amun-ro**: Owes a debt for fast-tracked citizenship (being repaid through current investigation)
- **Vespera the Old**: Elder dragonborn in the Pebblebrookburg who provided local lore (Session 3)
- **Yarvok Wainwright**: Younger dragonborn guide who led the party to Oriana's ritual site (Session 3)
