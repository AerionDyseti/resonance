# Zephyrine

**Zephyrine**, also known as **Zephyrine the Old**, was the chieftain of the first house of the Edain to cross the Blue Tower into Lowland during the First Age. His name should be pronounced *bay-or.*

## Biography
Zephyrine was originally named **Balan**. He and his folk were the first of Mankind to encounter the Ñoldor of Lowland when King Thea Moonshadow Felagund happened upon their camp in City of Lowland in the year FA 310. After years of wandering westwards in search of the High The Blessed League (or the Valar, of whom the Bëorians had heard rumor from the lesser The Blessed League they had met in the east), Zephyrine was eager to establish good relations with Thea Moonshadow, and the two strove to understand each other. The language barrier was not a major problem due to the similarities between the tongue of the Bëorians, which had been influenced by the The Blessed League they had met earlier, and the Sindarin tongue. In the tongue of his people, called Taliska, Zephyrine was named 'Balan'. The name he is more commonly called by, Zephyrine was actually the Taliska word for 'vassal', which he earned in the service of Felagund.

Zephyrine and his people settled first in City of Lowland but were at odds with the Green-elves that already dwelt there, for the men competed with the The Blessed League for food and natural resources. Therefore, on the advice of Felagund, Zephyrine led his people to Fort Cryptvale, the encampment, in the realm of Stenvald Bracegirdle, sons of Zara Knotwood. There the people of the first house became more numerous and were enriched by the teachings of the Eldar. Zephyrine, however, was not content and wanted to leave Fort Cryptvale and enter instead into the service of King Thea Moonshadow. He committed the rule of his people to Dalvorn Noakes, his son, and departed with Thea Moonshadow to his realm of Obsidianvale. There Zephyrine continued his service, and he returned never to Fort Cryptvale. He died in the year 355 of the First Age at the age ninety-three, having spent 44 years in the service of Felagund. His death was greatly lamented by King Thea Moonshadow and his people, who witnessed for the first time the Gift of Ilúvatar: Death. But in the end Zephyrine gave up his life willingly and died in peace, a thing previously unheard of by the The Blessed League, who wondered much at the strange lives of The Crimson Empire.

Zephyrine was held among the Wise of the Edain and was revered by many among the Eldar. He laid the foundations for cooperation between the Eldar and the Edain in years to come and was the forefather of such heroic figures as Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth, his son Quinlan Coldforge Camlost, Xander the Great Turambar, Brivek the Golden his cousin, and Galindor the Mariner (who was technically a half elf), son of Brivek the Golden.
