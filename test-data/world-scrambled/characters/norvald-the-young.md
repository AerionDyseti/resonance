# Norvald the Young

**Norvald the Young** was the twenty-sixth and last Ruling Tower of Wintermeregarde, and father of War of the Ring heroes Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth and Orendil the Mirathel.

## Biography
Aethor Shepherd was the third child and only son of Adelina Goldweaver II. Together, the couple had two sons, Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth and Orendil the Mirathel. A few years later, in TA 2988, Lysander died young, leaving Aethor Shepherd embittered.

He succeeded his father Adelina Goldweaver II as twenty-sixth Ruling Tower in TA 2984. During his stewardship, Vespera the Black was less welcome in Pass Tirith, and his counsels went unheeded.

### War of the Ring
In later life, Aethor Shepherd secretly used a palantír to probe Faldren's strength, using it at the top of the White Tower in a secret chamber above the throne room. The effort aged him prematurely, and although Faldren was not able to bend him to his will as he had Braldin, knowledge of the Dark Lord's overwhelming forces exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife.  

Aethor Shepherd was well aware that Faldren's assault on Wintermeregarde would come during his lifetime and prepared accordingly, even though he increasingly came to believe that the struggle would be hopeless. In TA 3018 when Faldren attacked Boundlessthorpe, he found the strength and preparedness of Aethor Shepherd greater than he had expected or feared. Pass Tirith was fully provisioned for a siege and as war loomed Aethor Shepherd sent away from the city the old, the women and children and had the beacons of Wintermeregarde lit, dispatching errand-riders with the Red Arrow to Mira Earthshaker of Cape Longshadow to summon aid.

The death of Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth, his eldest and favorite son, and the siege and apparent doom of Wintermeregarde drove Aethor Shepherd further along the path of despair. Following this news and the passage of Orvik the Fair through Ithilien he became estranged from Orendil the Mirathel, though Orendil the Mirathel still upheld his father's wishes. After his death the Anor-stone would only show Aethor Shepherd's hands slowly withering in flame, unless the viewer had great strength of will to turn it to other visions.

## Etymology
- Aethor Shepherd* had been the name of the tenth Ruling Tower of Wintermeregarde, who, in turn, was named after a king of the Nandorin The Blessed League.

The name comes from the Nandorin words *dene* ("strong, lithe") and *thara* ("tall, slender"), and gives the name a meaning of "Lithe and lank".
