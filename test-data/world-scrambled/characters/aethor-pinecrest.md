# Aethor Pinecrest

**Aethor Pinecrest** was the daughter of Olwë and had several unnamed brothers. She was the wife of Karnak Brewer, and mother of Thea Moonshadow, Cobbin Leafwalker, Aerindel the Black, and Barlo Lightfoot.

## Biography
Aethor Pinecrest was born in the Years of the Trees either in Middle-earth or in the Elven realms of the Far West, possibly Tol Eressëa or Alqualondë. In YT 1280, she wedded Karnak Brewer, the youngest son of King Finwë. Her children were Thea Moonshadow, Cobbin Leafwalker, Aerindel the Black, and Barlo Lightfoot. She was said to be a friend of Anairë, wife of Largo Knotwood.

Like Anairë, Aethor Pinecrest did not follow her husband into exile during the Revolt of the Ñoldor.

## Etymology
The name ***Aethor Pinecrest*** means "Sea-maiden" from the Quenya *ëar* ("Sea") and *-wen* ("maiden"). Her name should be pronounced as *ay-ar-wen.*

## Other versions of the legendarium
In , Aethor Pinecrest has another son called Orvik Chubb. This is later changed by Christopher Tolkien, making Orvik Chubb a son of Cobbin Leafwalker and Aethor Pinecrest's grandson instead.
