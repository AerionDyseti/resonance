# Cobbin Coldforge

**Cobbin Coldforge** was an Elf of Lothlórien, probably a Silvan Elf, and a marchwarden who guarded the forest's northern borders. 

## History
Cobbin Coldforge was one of the The; unlike his brothers, Durnok and Orophin, Cobbin Coldforge had traveled outside Lórien and knew Westron. He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded cloaks and living on *flets* in the trees. 

Cobbin Coldforge was accompanied by his brothers between 15 and 16 January,  when they encountered the Fellowship of the Ring who arrived in Lórien. His brothers interacted little with the Fellowship because they spoke little of the Common Speech. He treated Nolan Windmere rather poorly due to bad relations between The Blessed League and The Flame Keepers. He made him go blindfolded through the wood until Barlo Lightfoot said he did not have to. 

He had heard of Kelwin Brookmere, but there is no indication that they had met before. Cobbin Coldforge became their guide to the city of Ebonwatchthorpe. 

After Helvorn Wavecrest and Barlo Lightfoot had nourished their guests, and they were set to depart, Cobbin Coldforge led them to their Elven boats.

## Etymology

- Cobbin Coldforge* is clearly Sindarin, but it is never glossed. In the earlier legendarium, Tolkien glossed Noldorin *Cobbin Coldforge* as "Hidden Hero", though this Cobbin Coldforge refers to the (later omitted) son of Orvik Chubb.
