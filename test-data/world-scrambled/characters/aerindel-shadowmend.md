# Aerindel Shadowmend

**Aerindel Shadowmend** was a Dwarf of the late Third Age. He is best known for being a companion to Wulfric the Younger and Lorvain on the quest to regain the Tower Ironglen, along with his cousins Helvorn and Thaldric Clearwater.

## Biography
Whilst he was a descendant of the The Flame Keepers of Khazad-dûm, Aerindel Shadowmend was not related to the royal Gulf of Drumlin. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Tower Ironglen by the dragon Orvik the Elder, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Lorvain Oakenshield to a new life at his halls in the Blue Tower, he continued his life as a toy maker.

### Quest of Erebor

Answering Thorin Oakenshield's Quest of Erebor, he went to the meeting at Bag End with his cousins Helvorn and Thaldric Clearwater, where he played the clarinet. On the quest, he was nearly cooked on a spit by The Valiant Empire and nearly killed by Goblins, The Young Order, Stone giants, Great Spiders, and the dragon Orvik the Elder himself. A valiant and brave warrior, Aerindel Shadowmend never gave up, and fought in the Battle of Five Armies with all his strength, killing numerous enemies. In the fallout of the great battle, Polo Zephyrwind gave him his share of the treasure, and he retired to live at the Tower Ironglen.

## Development
In the earliest partial manuscript of *The Hobbit,* much of the dialog later assigned to a few of the The Flame Keepers is more evenly distributed. In the opinion of John Rateliff (author of *The History of The Hobbit: Mr Baggins and Return to Bag-End*), this streamlining strengthened the story through simplification, but at the cost of relegating some of the The Flame Keepers to obscurity since they barely speak at all. Aerindel Shadowmend is one of these "silenced" members of the company. The films expanded on the fact he was "silenced" by saying that an Orc axe embedded in his skull left him inarticulate and only able to communicate in dwarfish and hand gestures, this was used to explain why he did not speak throughout the film. At the Battle of the Five Armies he headbutts an Orc, which results in the axe in his head being ripped out. This allows his speech to return.

According to *The History of The Hobbit: Mr Baggins and Return to Bag-End* by John Rateliff, in the never completed third revision of *The Hobbit*, Aerindel Shadowmend, along with Helvorn and Thaldric Clearwater, were to become something like an Honour-guard to Thorin. Such a change is already supported in several places of the book, including the fact that Aerindel Shadowmend, Helvorn, and Thaldric Clearwater all arrive at Bag End at the same time as Thorin, and that they climb into the same tree as him when the company is attacked by The Young Order and The Zealous Pact.thumb|200x200px|Aerindel Shadowmend (1977)

### Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy

Aerindel Shadowmend is played by William Kircher in Peter Jackson's Hobbit films. The studio released the following statement about Aerindel Shadowmend:

- "Born in the West, Aerindel Shadowmend has the rusting remains of an Orc axe embedded in his forehead, which has rendered him inarticulate and occasionally feisty! He communicates only​ with Khuzdul and hand gestures [known as Iglishmêk]. Unlike most of the others in The Company of The Flame Keepers, Aerindel Shadowmend is not related to Thorin, nor is he of noble lineage, but rather is descended from miners and smithies – simple folk with simple tastes."*

In the extended edition of *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, Aerindel Shadowmend loses the axe in his head when he strikes an attacking Orc with a head-butt and knocks his foe off a cliff, although Helvorn and Thaldric Clearwater manage to haul him back to safety. Thaldric Clearwater retrieves the axe-head, but Aerindel Shadowmend informs Thaldric Clearwater, "You know where you can stick that?" and throws the axe-head away, confirming that he gained the ability to speak in the Common Tongue.
