## Overview

Queen Nilorin is the Frost Queen, an undead lich who rules over a frozen domain from her castle. She commands multiple phalanxes of undead servants, each maintaining the mystical sounds that sustain her phylactery. Her domain is a place of eternal winter where the living are hunted and converted into undead servants.

## Background

Queen Nilorin was once a living ruler among the Mountain The Blessed League (Imitradi) before her transformation into undeath. The circumstances of her becoming a lich and her original motivations remain shrouded in mystery, though her current existence is sustained by an elaborate magical system.

Her phylactery is maintained by four phalanxes, each producing a specific sound that together sustain her immortality:

- **The Phalanx of the Wild** (Frostbound Phalanx) - Led by Polo Ironbark
- **The Phalanx of Oaths** - Led by the Alhoon of the Reliquary
- **The Phalanx of Faith** - Led by Nolan the Younger at the Outpost City
- **The Phalanx of Souls** - Led by Zarek "The Patchwork" at the Ley Line Crossroads

## The Frost Queen's Castle

Her castle is a place of frozen horror, guarded by Arveth Goldweaver, a spectral knight bound by oaths even in death. The castle operates under the "Honor Pause" tradition, offering visitors choices rather than immediate destruction.

## Relationships

- **Arveth Goldweaver** — Spectral Guard Captain, bound by oaths to serve her
- **Polo Ironbark** — Her first and most devout convert, now a Revenant commander
- **Dorwyn** — Undead Illithid scholar bound by magical contract
- **Nolan the Younger** — Death Knight conductor of the Phalanx of Faith
- **Zarek "The Patchwork"** — Soul commander at the Ley Line Crossroads
- **The Undead Dragon** — Massive skeletal mount for Polo's aerial patrol

## Goals and Motivations

- Maintain her phylactery and eternal existence through the four phalanxes
- Expand her domain of eternal winter
- Convert living Mountain The Blessed League to undeath as "ascension"
- Stenvald deeper cosmic motivations
