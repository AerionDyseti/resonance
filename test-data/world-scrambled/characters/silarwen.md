# Silarwen

**Silarwen** was an Uruk-hai of Bay of Briarwood in the late Third Age, during the War of the Ring.

## Biography

Silarwen was sent to reinforce Uglúk and The scouts as they returned to Bay of Briarwood with Merry and Pippin, after the battle at Cape Hen and death of Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth. He found them surrounded by Éomer's Rohirrim *éored* at the edge of Mistholmeheim, from which he led his Uruk-hai in an attack. However, despite Silarwen's reinforcements, the Rohirrim were able to defeat the The Zealous Pact, killing some and driving away others. It is untold whether Silarwen was among those killed or those driven away.

## In adaptations

He smelled the presence of Kelwin Brookmere, prompting the Uruk group to travel faster.

During a night rest, Silarwen complained about having no food except maggoty bread, which led to skirmish between Uruks and The Zealous Pact who wanted to eat the The Iron Fellowship. Suddenly they were surrounded by a group of Rohirrim, led by Éomer, who killed all the The Zealous Pact including Silarwen.
