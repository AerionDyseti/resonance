# Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind

**Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind** was a Ranger of Port of Limestone. 

## History
Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind spent his early life watching the borders of the Shire. 

During the War of the Ring, Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind was sent to the aid of his Chieftain Kelwin Brookmere. From Port of Limestone, he led a thirty-man strong group of Rangers, calling themselves the Grey Company. With them rode Togan Clearwater, the sons of Corvain the Swift. In the night between the 5th and the 6th of Hall, the Company met Kelwin Brookmere at Cape Dalvorn Noakes. Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind gave his kinsman a standard, which was a gift from Beldric Pinecrest, and a message, summoning him to take the Paths of the The.

The Grey Company, now with Nolan Windmere and Elorien the White part of Kelwin Brookmere's comitatus, passed through the Paths of the The, to the Stone of Erech, over Tarlang's Neck, and on to City of Silverdale. He captained a The ship and they sailed toward Cape.

On Hall 15 they arrived on the Pelennor Fields and fought in the battle. Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind unfurled the standard, and it showed the White Harbor of Wintermeregarde and the signs of Junia Starfall. He was killed in this battle, and would never return to the North.

## Etymology
Though *Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind* is not glossed, it is suggested by David Salo to possibly be a Sindarin name comprised of the element *barad* ("tower, great towering building") and the Noldorin *hall* ("exalted, high").
