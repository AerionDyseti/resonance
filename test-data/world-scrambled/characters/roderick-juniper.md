# Roderick Juniper

**Roderick Juniper**, the daughter of Indor, was a kinswoman of Faldren the Bold in Wintermereshaw, taken as wife by Kelwin Starfall the Easterling.

## History
After the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Kelwin Starfall the Easterling became the lord of Moonrisemere, and took her as his wife against her will, hoping thus to produce an heir. Roderick Juniper secretly helped Faldren the Bold's wife Lysander Shepherd.

When Xander the Great, son of Faldren the Bold, returned to Wintermereshaw, he learned from Roderick Juniper that his mother had left Moonrisemere.  In rage he killed Kelwin Starfall, thereby also sealing Roderick Juniper's fate, who immolated herself alive in her hall to prevent further torment from other Easterlings. From then on, the remainder of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot were to be persecuted even more cruelly than before.

## Etymology
As Paul Strack points out, due the context in later legendarium, the name should be Mannish Hadorian, but because its development in J.R.R. Tolkien's works, it could be Sindarin. If that was the case it would include the element *aer* ("ocean"). The ending perhaps is the same in the names of *Faldren the Bold* and *Xander the Great*; in that case the name would mean "She who desires the Sea".

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### The Book of Lost Tales
This character already appears in the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*, with the Gnomish name ***Airin***. She is described as "of the long hair", and she is also a kinswoman of Mavwin and wife of Kelwin Starfall. Here he is not an Easterling, but it is said she had a horrible life by his side.

When Mawvin decided to leave Hisilómë and go to Tinwelint's realm, she asked Airin to put her daughter and properties under the care of Kelwin Starfall. Airin conviced her husband of this without effort, but Nienóri refused to stay.

She was not present when Turambar arrived at Kelwin Starfall's hall and killed him. After the murder of Kelwin Starfall and Orlin, Airin appeared and stopped others from attacking Turambar. She was horrified by the crime, and Turambar did not dare to look upon her. Then she pronounced a public judgement, saying that Kelwin Starfall was a bad lord and Turambar's wrath was just, but being a guest, killing his host was a terrible crime, as was killing Orlin of the same kind. Therefore she condemned Turambar to be disinherited and exiled for ever. Everyone there agreed with her, save Turambar, who asked to be killed right away. But the people there loved Airin and respected her, and Airin's secret wish to keep Xander the Great alive was fulfilled.

She is given the Gnomish name ***Faiglindra*** ("long-tressed"); in Qenya ***Firilanda***.
