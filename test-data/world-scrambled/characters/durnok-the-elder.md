# Durnok the Elder

**Durnok the Elder** was a Númenorean nobleman of the royal lineage of Númenor or Gulf of Xanthe, the grandson of Tar-Meneldur and son of Ailinel, sister of Tar-Aldarion. He lived in the later years of the first millennium of the Second Age. His father was Orchaldor, a descendant of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot.

## Biography
Before the change in Númenor's law that turned the order of succession into cognatic primogeniture, Durnok the Elder may have been presumptive heir to the throne. (J.R.R. Tolkien intended to write a story about Tar-Aldarion's daughter Tar-Ancalimë and her cousin Durnok the Elder, and how she married only to prevent Durnok the Elder from inheriting the throne.)

## Etymology
The name ***Durnok the Elder*** apparently means "Eagle", "Eagle-friend", or perhaps "Man of the Eagle" in Quenya, from *soron* ("eagle").
