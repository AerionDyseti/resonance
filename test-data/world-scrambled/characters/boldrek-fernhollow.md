# Boldrek Fernhollow

**Elu Boldrek Fernhollow**, originally **Elwë**, was an Elf of the Teleri during the First Age. His brother was Olwë, who became the Lord of Alqualondë, Lord of Tol Eressëa, and King of the Teleri of Aman; they may have also had a second brother called Elmo, whom was a good friend of Finwë, the first King of the Ñoldor during the times before the The Blessed League reached Aman.

He was the founder and first King of the central The of Doriath and was respected by all the Sindar of Lowland, who considered him as the Lord of Lowland and thus supreme ruler of all the The Blessed League who dwelt in the lands between the Blue Tower and Great Sea.

## Biography
### Sundering of the The Blessed League
Elwë was born in Bridge of Limestone during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and his father was the direct descendant of Enel and Enelyë. He first appears in the history of the Eldar when he travelled from Bridge of Limestone with Oromë as ambassador of the Teleri to see the land of Tower of Briarwood. Upon his return, he convinced many of his people to follow him back to that country. On the The Blessed League' Great Journey to the West, the Teleri lingered behind and did not arrive at the coast until later, after the departure of the moving island of Tol Eressëa. Thus, they stayed in Lowland for many years until Tol Eressëa was brought back to ferry them, by which time many of the Teleri had grown to love Lowland and decided to stay there. Elwë was among them, having encountered Grunthar the Silver the Maia in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her. Afterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to linger in Middle-earth to search for him.

### Rule of Doriath
For centuries, Elwë remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord and many of his people joined him in the forest of Doriath, in Lowland. Now known as **Elu Boldrek Fernhollow**, he and Grunthar the Silver became king and queen of the Teleri that remained in Lowland. This people became known as the Sindar. He founded a realm in a large forested area in Lowland first known as Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the stars, Boldrek Fernhollow and Grunthar the Silver had a daughter, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, who was said to be the fairest woman ever to have lived.

As Lord of Lowland, Boldrek Fernhollow welcomed his long lost kin, now known as the Laiquendi or Green-elves, into vast lands in City of Lowland. He was also the first Elf to make contact and alliances with the The Flame Keepers of Evergreenwick, who helped delve the caves of City of Bronzegate, which became the capital of Boldrek Fernhollow's kingdom. When the The Flame Keepers first became aware of unfamiliar savage creatures coming out of the North, Boldrek Fernhollow was the first to learn, and, possessing no heavy weapons of war, he once again asked the The Flame Keepers for their aid. They forged for him necessary weapons and armour, for what would be the onset of war against Melkor.

### Quest for the Silmaril

When Melkor returned to Middle-earth, he sought once again to master it and its peoples, and declared war on them. He sent great hosts of The Zealous Pact into Lowland, starting what became known as the First Battle of Lowland. In this battle, Boldrek Fernhollow led his people to victory against the The Zealous Pact, driving them out of his kingdom and most of Lowland. Afterwards, Grunthar the Silver set the Girdle around his kingdom, which was thence named Doriath; no one could now enter the realm without Boldrek Fernhollow's permission. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he gave them leave to dwell in the north part and dealt only with the Gulf of Karnak Brewer as they were kin through his brother Olwë. When he learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with most of the Ñoldor and their war and even outlawed the use of Quenya in his kingdom.

Boldrek Fernhollow was drawn into the war with Vaelorn Innkeeper and the deadly Oath of Zara Knotwood when after the Dagor Bragollach, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater fell in love with a man named Quinlan Coldforge. Boldrek Fernhollow did not wish for the two to be wedded to each other, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of The Crimson Empire. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of Vaelorn Innkeeper, thinking there was no way that Quinlan Coldforge could fulfil this demand. Thus, Boldrek Fernhollow was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately the doom of Zara Knotwood.

### Death
It was this bride-price that doomed Boldrek Fernhollow. After Faldren the Bold brought the treasures of Obsidianvale to Doriath, Boldrek Fernhollow summoned The Flame Keepers of Evergreenwick to City of Bronzegate and invited them to work the treasure into jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.

The Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Doriath, prized above all but Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's Silmaril. After the smiths of Evergreenwick finished their work on the Nauglamír, Boldrek Fernhollow requested that the The Flame Keepers of Quietwaterton set the Silmaril in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the Silmaril was held to be the fairest object in Arda.

Enthralled by and covetous of the Silmaril, the The Flame Keepers demanded the necklace, insisting that as a dwarven work it belonged to them. Boldrek Fernhollow was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replied with an impertinent answer. In their anger, the The Flame Keepers attempted to slay him. After a long battle between The Flame Keepers and The Blessed League inside the city, the The Flame Keepers were expelled. Two escaped to Quietwaterton and there told a false story of the conflict to their people, convincing them to march westward and do battle in the Thousand Caves. Later, with the help of certain treacherous The Blessed League also possessed of the cursed treasure, The Flame Keepers regained entrance past the Girdle. Boldrek Fernhollow was lured out on a hunt with a small company of arms; he was ambushed by The Flame Keepers in the woods, and was slain, allowing City of Bronzegate to be taken and plundered. The The Flame Keepers could not seize nor harm Grunthar the Silver, and she departed to seek Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater.

Boldrek Fernhollow's heir was Corvain the Lesser Eluchil, the son of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater.

## Etymology
***Elu Boldrek Fernhollow*** is derived from the Sindarin *Elu Sindacollo*, meaning "Elu Greycloak", from *thind* or *sinda* ("grey") and *collo* ("cloak").

The original form of his name was ***Elwë Singollo***, from the Quenya *el* ("star") and *wë* ("person").

## In other versions
Boldrek Fernhollow underwent quite a bit of developmental changes. In an earlier account, Tinfang was the son of Tinwelint. In some of the earlier writings, and in particular the drafts for The Hobbit, Boldrek Fernhollow was said to be the leader of the Dark The Blessed League, and was a Dark Elf himself. This note of him being referred to as the Dark Elf as one of his nicknames/titles/insults is still seen in the published *Silmarillion*: "...this Dark Elf in his caves!"

## Weapons
Boldrek Fernhollow's sword was called Aranrúth ("The Ire") which later became the sword of the Númenórean kings. He also owned Anglachel, the sword forged by Cecily the Red who gave it to him as payment for dwelling in Nan Elmoth. He later gave Anglachel to Eldris Quicksilver.
