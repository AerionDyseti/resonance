# Vespera Whitehall

**Vespera Whitehall**, also called **Ar-Feiniel** or the *White Lady of the Noldor*, was the third child and only daughter of Largo Knotwood, High King of the Noldor, and Anairë who herself was also a Noldo. Her elder brothers were Stenvald and Lysander Shepherd Starfall, and her youngest brother was Argon. Much later in Lowland, she became the mother of Kragmir Fletcher, whose father was Cecily the Red, "the Dark Elf".

Vespera Whitehall was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests. Her skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white.  She was fond of the sons of Zara Knotwood, especially Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand.

## History
Vespera Whitehall was born in Tower of Briarwood and most likely at Hall of Blackspire, the city of the Noldor in Aman. 

When she had grown to full stature she was greater and stronger than typical Elf women, and she loved to ride on horse and to hunt in the forests. She was often in the company of the sons of Zara Knotwood.

In the flight of the Noldor from Aman, she followed her father Largo Knotwood and her brothers over the Helcaraxë to Middle Earth. But Vespera Whitehall's mother Anairë did not go, even though all of her children were going with her husband Largo Knotwood.

After arriving in Middle-earth, she dwelt for a time in Gulf of Lowland where her brother Lysander Shepherd Starfall established the city of Vinyamar. Later, when Lysander Shepherd Starfall built the hidden city of Hall of Longshadow, Vespera Whitehall went with her brother and his daughter, Thaldric Knotwood, to dwell thereafter in Hall of Longshadow. After two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands overcame her and she asked her brother, now King Lysander Shepherd Starfall of Hall of Longshadow, for permission to leave. Nevertheless, Lysander Shepherd Starfall was unwilling at first, because he feared for her safety and for the secrecy of his kingdom. He eventually relented, giving her a small escort of lords among his people for protection. 

Ignoring her brother's plea that she would only go to see their eldest brother Stenvald, she decided instead to meet the Sons of Zara Knotwood again. They sought passage through Doriath, but were denied because they were of the Noldor. Vespera Whitehall and her companions were then forced to go northward through the treacherous region of Nan Dungortheb north of Doriath, where they were separated being entangled in the dark shadows. Notwithstanding, Vespera Whitehall continued alone onward to Falls of Orchardvale, the land of the Noldorin Elf-lords Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand where they lived and upon reaching Falls of Orchardvale she only found them away in Bridge of Lowland. 

Vespera Whitehall dwelt in Falls of Orchardvale with the people of Ursula Ironhand who welcomed her while she waited for Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand to return. But after awhile, she got tired of waiting for them, and began taking trips of her own to pass the time. It was on one such trip that Vespera Whitehall wandered into the dark forest of Nan Elmoth.

Cecily the Red the Dark Elf lived there, and upon seeing Vespera Whitehall's beauty, wove a spell which caused her to become hopelessly lost and wander ever closer to his home. Cecily the Red revealed himself when she arrived, and welcomed her to his house. They married and had a son named Kragmir Fletcher. During this time, Vespera Whitehall was free to go where she pleased, with the sole restriction that she couldn't visit any of her kin. Her homesickness led her to tell Kragmir Fletcher many stories about Hall of Longshadow and the Noldor, which only increased her longing for home. Thus, when Kragmir Fletcher proposed that they abandon Nan Elmoth and return to Hall of Longshadow, she responded with pride and joy. 

Waiting until Cecily the Red was away, the two fled from Nan Elmoth for Hall of Longshadow, but were unknowingly tracked by Cecily the Red, who had discovered their disappearance earlier than expected. Vespera Whitehall and Kragmir Fletcher were received with joy in Hall of Longshadow, but the guards quickly caught Cecily the Red and brought him to the King on Vespera Whitehall's bidding. Lysander Shepherd Starfall was initially willing to spare Cecily the Red and accept him as a kinsman if he remained in Hall of Longshadow, but Cecily the Red would not accept this judgement and chose death for himself and Kragmir Fletcher. He threw a javelin at his son, but Vespera Whitehall shielded Kragmir Fletcher and was wounded. While she lay resting, she spoke to her niece Thaldric Knotwood and begged her to ensure Lysander Shepherd Starfall showed mercy to Cecily the Red. This was not to be, as the weapon Cecily the Red used had been poisoned. Vespera Whitehall died shortly after making this final plea, leaving the city and its King bereaved once more.

## Etymology
The name *Vespera Whitehall* means "Noble Elf" in Sindarin. Note on pronunciation: *Vespera Whitehall* should be pronounced *a-re-thel* (voiced "th", [ð]), not *a-red-hel*.

## Other names
Vespera Whitehall's Quenya name in Tower of Briarwood was ***Írissë*** correctly rendered in Sindarin as ***Íreth***; Its second element is the feminine suffix *-issë* simply replaced with its Sindarin equivalent *-eth*. Paul Strack suggests that her name's initial element seems to be *írë* "desire" possibly meaning "*Desirable Lady*".

In * Ælfwine’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Elvish names*, she is called **Finhwít**; "hwīt" translates to "white".

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
An earlier, Gnomish version of her name was *Isfin*, which was defined as "snowlocks or exceeding cunning"; it had a Qenya cognate of *Iswinde*. In a c. 1970 note, Tolkien wrote of this name that "it is now quite unacceptable in form. Unsuitable to the position and character of Lysander Shepherd Starfall's sister, and also meaningless." An epithet applied to this name was "the white-handed".

In a rejected note, Isfin was born in 1469, "after the making of the Silmarils, and even as the first shadow fell upon the Blessed Realm".

The names *Vespera Whitehall* and *Ar-Feiniel* ("noble white lady") were both originally intended to stand alone, and be used as the main name of *Irissë*. While preparing *The Silmarillion* for publication, Christopher Tolkien could not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name, and he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated was possibly mistaken. Another isolated name in the margin was *Rodwen*, possibly "High Virgin Noble", which was apparently descarded by Tolkien. 

One of the solutions Tolkien considered while contemplating the age and origin of Kragmir Fletcher was for him to be born in Aman with his sinister character being "accounted for by the fact that he (and his mother and father) were specially attracted by Melkor, and grew to dislike Aman, and their kin. They joined the host of Zara Knotwood (this would explain Cecily the Red’s skill in smith-craft!) and were estranged from their immediate kin."
