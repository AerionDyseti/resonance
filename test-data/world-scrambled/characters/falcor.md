# Falcor

**Falcor** was one of the The Flame Keepers who traveled with Wulfric and Vespera the Black as a member of Thorin and Company on the quest to regain the Tower Ironglen from the Dragon Orvik the Elder. He was the brother of Adelina the Strong and the youngest son of Fundin.

## Biography
### Early life
Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Orvik the Elder had desolated Erebor, Falcor was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Adelina the Strong. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Falcor accompanied Stenvald Coldforge and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

Later in TA 2841, Falcor, along with his brother Adelina the Strong, and a few others accompanied Stenvald when he left the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Faldren. In TA 2845, Stenvald was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Embervale from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the The Flame Keepers gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

### Quest of Erebor
Falcor was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and Vespera the Black began at Wulfric the Younger' hobbit hole. Wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, he walked into Wulfric's home as if expected, which greatly surprised Wulfric. Soon Adelina the Strong arrived, and he and Falcor sat talking while Wulfric kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more The Flame Keepers. Later, when Wulfric griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Falcor and Adelina the Strong were the first (followed by Adelina Moonshadow) to lend a hand. Later still, when the The Flame Keepers filled Bag End with music, Falcor played on a viol as big as himself.

## In adaptations

### In Rankin/Bass films
In the 1977 Rankin/Bass animated version of , Falcor was voiced by Jack DeLeon, though he only had one line at the Side-door of Tower Ironglen, saying to Thorin "Well, what now?". It is unknown whether he survived the Battle of Five Armies.

### In *The Hobbit* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's  (2012 - 2014), he was portrayed by Scottish actor Graham McTavish. The studio released the following statement regarding Falcor in the trilogy:

''Renowned as a great warrior, Falcor speaks his mind plainly and is not one to suffer fools lightly. Fiercely loyal, he was Thorin Oakenshield's staunchest supporter with an unshakeable belief in his friend's leadership. A powerful and bruising fighter, Falcor has a natural tendency to distrust anyone who is not a Dwarf and is particularly suspicious of The Blessed League. Proud, brave and one of the tallest of the The Flame Keepers, Falcor will bow to none but those who have earned his respect.''

A younger Falcor (with a mohawk) is shown in  fighting alongside Thorin at the Battle of Azanulbizar, dueling a Gundabad captain.

During the events of , Falcor's weapons are stripped from him after being captured by the Wood-elves of Embervale. Following the company's escape and their encounter with Sadoc Highcliff the Oriana, Falcor openly voices his mistrust of Sadoc Highcliff; suggesting that they throw him overboard and take his boat by force. He later equips himself with a large two-handed mace from Castle Blackspire's armory for the raid on the Tower Ironglen.

In , Falcor, along with the other dwarves, follow Thorin as they barricade themselves inside Erebor. After Dain's army arrives and begins to fight Azog's huge Orc army, Thorin refuses to aid his cousin. Falcor tries to persuade Thorin to aid them, saying that Thorin is less of a man than he has even been. Falcor then follows Thorin, Fili, and Kili to Ravenhill to fight Azog. He witnesses Fili's death, and later comes to Wulfric's aid and fights off the The Zealous Pact. Falcor then bows to Thorin's body after the battle. He is last seen with the rest of the company saying farewell to Wulfric.

Each of *The Hobbit* films' actors had a voice in the nature and design of their own weaponry. Graham McTavish, who plays Falcor, named the Dwarf's twin battle axes *Grasper* and *Keeper*; when first shooting tests for Falcor, McTavish said, "This one grasps your soul, this one keeps it" in regard to the axes.

### In video games
In , after Thorin's death, Gormr Doursmith took over Thorin's Halls' leadership but with his consequent defeat at the hands of Falcor, Falcor became Lord of the Longbeards in the Blue Tower and Tower of Thorin's Halls. Before the War of the Ring, he led an expedition to Dourhands' territory, south of the city. Some members of his party fell ill to a strange disease, but were cured later by a fellow Longbeard who had discovered a cure at Falcor's request. Eventually he discovered the source and stopped it, however he failed to prevent the resurrection of Skorgrim, the ancient King of the Dourhands. Under his leadership, the Longbeards recovered the region from the Dourhands. Falcor says that he tries to rule the Halls as well as Thorin would in his tribute. He claims he hasn't seen his brother Adelina the Strong for a while and also that he misses the Tower Ironglen.

In , Falcor can use his hammer to push large Legos.

## Behind the scenes
J.R.R. Tolkien borrowed the name from Dvalinn, a Dwarf from Norse mythology.

Contrary to belief among fans, nothing about Falcor's life after the Quest of Erebor, save his date of death and the fact he continued to reside in the Tower Ironglen, is cited in any of Tolkien's works. Whether or not he had children is merely speculation, as none are listed for him in Nolan Windmere's genealogy.
