## Overview

Coldscale Shifter Grave Cleric, one of the player characters in the Heroes for Hire campaign. A member of the Ghral-Varin people whose Circle was destroyed by temporal poison.

## Time Pool Visions (Session 9)

### Past (Slow Pool)

Saw themselves with their Circle, back when they were happy—before their death by the explosion's poison gas.

### Present (Medium Pool)

Saw the Glen; learned the Shifters are only just now discovering the death of their Circle.

### Future (Fast Pool)

Saw themselves worn and tired, covered in memory-tokens of dozens of people with strange names—a Coldscales tradition honoring those they couldn't save. This is foreshadowing of their life if they return to the Age of Enlightenment.

## The Circle's Death

Brienna the Golden's entire Circle was killed by noxious fumes from an explosion that hasn't happened yet.
