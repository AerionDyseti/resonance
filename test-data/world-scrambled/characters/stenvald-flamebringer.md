AI summary: The Stenvald Hyrian Warrior, found in the ancient cistern, was a soldier in old Hyrian armor, killed by his brother-in-arms during a desperate moment of starvation. This act transformed the spear used in the murder into a cursed artifact. The warrior's remains were discovered alongside his killer's, and the party chose to leave them undisturbed after retrieving the spear for purification.

## Overview

The Stenvald Hyrian Warrior was a soldier whose skeletal remains were discovered by the Keys to Perfection party at the bottom of the fissure in the ancient cistern beneath the Mistholmemere oasis. His body was found in old Hyrian armor, impaled by the cursed black spear.

## Identity

His true name is unknown. He served alongside the warrior who would become the Mirathel Burrows, and though they were not blood relatives, they had survived enough together that they considered each other brothers. He wore the armor of a Hyrian soldier from the era of the Darkness Wars.

## Death

When the two warriors fell into the cistern during their mission to transport the spear, they became trapped with no escape. As their rations ran out and starvation set in, his brother-in-arms descended into madness. In a moment of overwhelming, irrational hatred, the other warrior murdered him with the very spear they had been trying to protect.

The trauma and evil of this act was absorbed by the spear, transforming it into a cursed artifact. His killer became the Mirathel Burrows, doomed to haunt the cistern for centuries.

## Discovery

When Dorwyn touched the cursed spear, she experienced fragmentary visions of the warrior's final days from his killer's perspective—including the moment of his murder, driven by starvation-induced hatred.

## Remains

His skeleton was found alongside his brother's remains at the bottom of the fissure. The party chose to leave the bodies undisturbed after removing the cursed spear for purification at the Lake of Light.
