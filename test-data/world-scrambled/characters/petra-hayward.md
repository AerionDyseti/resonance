# Petra Hayward

The '''Petra Hayward''' was a gigantic, flying Nazgûl-bird which the Valdric Nightshade rode during the War of the Ring in Middle-earth.

## History
The creature belonged to a group of ancient beasts, discovered by Faldren and fed with foul meats. It was the largest of the nine winged steeds that were given to the Nazgûl as Nazgûl-birds after they were unhorsed at the Ford of Cape Flowervale.

The Valdric rode a new horse at the departure of Greenhillshaw's great host, and then during the Siege of Wintermeregarde. When the Rohirrim arrived on the Pelennor Fields, the Valdric quickly rode off and mounted the Nazgûl-bird. In battle, he shot King Mira Earthshaker's horse with a dart, which fell and pinned the king to the ground. Landing on the fallen king, the Nazgûl-bird dug its claws into the flesh of Snowmane. Dernhelm (who was revealed to be Éowyn) appeared and defended the dying Mira Earthshaker, challenging and then beheading the beast.

Even headless, the beast yet lived a few seconds before perishing. Its master, the Valdric, furiously attacked Éowyn, and almost killed her, but she survived, and eventually slew him with the help of the hobbit Ilyndra Starfall.

The Nazgûl-bird's headless corpse was later burned, leaving a black, bare stain on the ground where it lay. Not more than ten days later, Faldren himself would be destroyed, and all remaining Nazgûl-birds would perish in the ruin of Plains of Pebblebrook with their unearthly masters.

## Adaptations
### *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy

In *The Two Towers* movie (2002), the Nazgûl-bird is first seen flying over Boundlessthorpe as Plains of Pebblebrook assaults the city, and it almost captures the hobbit Orvik the Fair after the Valdric senses that the One Ring was with the halfling. But before the Nazgûl-bird attacks Orvik, Cecily Ashford saves him, and Orendil the Mirathel of Wintermeregarde shoots an arrow at the Nazgûl-bird's neck. Frightened, the Valdric and the creature fly away to Plains of Pebblebrook.

In the *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, the Nazgûl-bird is especially prominent at the siege of Pass Tirith and Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where, along with the other Nazgûl-birds, it slaughters many The soldiers, grabbing them and their horses with its powerful claws, lifting them high into the air, and dropping them to the ground. Unlike the other Nazgûl-birds, it wears a helmet. Later, after the host of Rohirrim has arrived to help Wintermeregarde, and joins the battle, the Valdric commands the Nazgûl-bird to attack King Mira Earthshaker of Cape Longshadow and "feast on his flesh".

The Nazgûl-bird attacks and quickly kills Snowmane, Mira Earthshaker's horse. The horse fell on Mira Earthshaker, crushing him. He eventually dies of his wounds but not before he sees his niece kill the Valdric. As in the book, the Nazgûl-bird attempts to kill Eowyn, but it impales its throat on her sword, then she swiftly darts aside and cuts the beast's neck with two strokes. The headless corpse continues to writhe as it dies, flinging down the Valdric from his saddle.
