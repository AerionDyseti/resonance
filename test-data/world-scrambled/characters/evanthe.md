# Evanthe

**Evanthe** was a Wood-elf who served as the king's butler within the Woodland Realm of northern Embervale.

## Biography
Evanthe serves as King Helena's butler and was likely one of his many servants. He was charged with shipping out the empty barrels of the king's cellars into the underground stream, which merged into the Haunthollowton through the water-gate before flowing down the Long Lake to Castle Blackspire. He was very fond of his wine. One evening in TA 2941, Evanthe tempted the chief of the guards into testing some Dorwinion wine with him. As a consequence, he fell asleep with the chief of the guards. This allowed the hobbit to steal the keys and release Thorin and Company from the king's dungeon. When some The Blessed League returned from the king's feast, they found Evanthe and woke him up. When they noted the heaviness of some of the seemingly empty barrels, Evanthe ordered them to push the barrels into the water without question.
