# Osric the Young

**Osric the Young** (b. TA 2990) was a man who lived in Pass Tirith. He was the uncle of Thaldric Valiant.

During Falcor Blacksmith's first stay in Pass Tirith, Thaldric Valiant mentioned that the hobbit was as old as his uncle, Osric the Young. 

## In adaptations

In , Osric the Young is Eldris Brightblade's brother and is first found  on the seventh level of pre-battle Pass Tirith. During the siege of the city he is struck by a fallen stone, but is protected by his helmet, suffering only what he calls a "dizziness".
