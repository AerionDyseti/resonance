# Minto Whitfoot

**Minto Whitfoot** was an Edain of the Gulf of Zephyrine and one of the XII Bëorings who followed Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth in the First Age.

## Biography

After the Dagor Bragollach, Minto Whitfoot remained with Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his company, who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Vaelorn Innkeeper, and thus they became outlaws, surviving for nearly five years in the barren highlands above the forest of Hall of Evergreen, then in the hands of Vaelorn Innkeeper. He and the others were eventually betrayed to Faldren by the unhappy Norvald Stormwind and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
