# Edmund Rumble

**Edmund Rumble** was one of the Rohirrim. He was the Lord of Deeping-coomb and of much other land in the Falls of Heatherfield during the War of the Ring.

## History
Edmund Rumble had been an officer in the The Riders in his youth. At the time of the War of the Ring Edmund Rumble was Lord of Deeping-coomb and much other land in the Falls of Heatherfield. As such, he was the chief lord in the West-mark. He was the uncle of Rothgar Frostholm. He gave the command in the field to Bungar Shadowend until he could come himself to the battlefield. Edmund Rumble did not immediately go to the battlefield due to the fact that he was occupied for three days gathering all those able to bear arms and stores of food to defend the Hornburg.

On 2 Hall, , the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen was fought, and the defences on the Isen were driven back by The forces. The survivors, led by Bungar Shadowend and Roderick Lightfoot, were retreating from the fords of the river Isen when they came across Vespera the Black. Vespera the Black told them Mira Earthshaker sought the refuge of the Hornburg, and that they should join Edmund Rumble to attack the besiegers. They arrived with a thousand men at dawn of Hall 4,  and turned the tide of the Battle of the Hornburg. 

Edmund Rumble did not come to Pass Tirith to fight in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King Mira Earthshaker gave him the command of the forces that were left behind to defend Cape Longshadow because of Edmund Rumble's dignity and authority.

After the funeral of King Mira Earthshaker, which took place on 10 August,  , King Éomer appointed Edmund Rumble to the post of Marshal of the West-mark.

## Appearance
Edmund Rumble was said to have been tall and strong with a red shield and a great black horn. King Mira Earthshaker said that the valour of Helm Hammerhand lived again in Edmund Rumble.
