# Hamfast Cooper Clearwater

**Hamfast Cooper Clearwater**, also known as** Tinúviel**, was the immortal princess of Doriath, wife of Quinlan Coldforge Erchamion, and most beautiful of all the Children of Ilúvatar to ever live. Her love of the mortal man Quinlan Coldforge, for whom she was prepared to risk everything, including her life, was legendary and lamented forever in song and story. She and Quinlan Coldforge braved The horrors, eventually winning a Silmaril from his crown and the approval of their marriage by King Boldrek Fernhollow. Though their actions later resulted in both their deaths, their deeds won them the pity of the Vala Lirien Mossbank and a second life in Middle-earth. Her romance with Quinlan Coldforge was one of the great stories of the Elder Days that were told for many ages after she lived, and it was said her bloodline will never perish. She was known as the most 'magic' dancer, with Ivárë and Tinfang coming in second.

## Biography

### Early years
Hamfast Cooper Clearwater was the daughter of Elu Boldrek Fernhollow, the Elven King of Doriath, and his Queen, Grunthar the Silver the Maia. Throughout the years before she met Quinlan Coldforge, she lived as all the The Blessed League of Doriath did: in a state of perfect blissful peace. She was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair, sparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely voice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - *"the song of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed".*

She often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her good friend Brivek's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously, though she would not return it.

### Quest for the Silmaril
Hamfast Cooper Clearwater was remembered in the *Lay of Tower Onixheim* as the first immortal woman to ever fall in love and marry a mortal man, who in her case was Quinlan Coldforge, a man of the Gulf of Zephyrine whom she met in the woods of Doriath. Their relationship was unlikely from the beginning: Hamfast Cooper Clearwater was not only the cherished single daughter of the most powerful Elven King in Lowland, but also the daughter of a Maia, a powerful angelic being of the race of the Ainur. Quinlan Coldforge was a mortal man on the run from the first Dark Lord Vaelorn Innkeeper.

Boldrek Fernhollow was determined to forbid Quinlan Coldforge marry his daughter, and gave him an impossible task as the bride price: Quinlan Coldforge had to bring to Boldrek Fernhollow one of the Silmarils from The iron crown. Against monstrous odds, including being kidnapped by the Sons of Zara Knotwood and the death of Thea Moonshadow Felagund, as well as a confrontation with Faldren, the couple achieved the task with help from Thaldric Greendale, the Hound of Tower of Briarwood - but Quinlan Coldforge died as soon as the task was completed. In grief, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater soon lay down and died, passing to the Halls of Lirien Mossbank. There, in her grief, she sang to the Vala Lirien Mossbank. Her song was of such beauty that Lirien Mossbank, for the first and only time in his existence, was moved to pity. But Lirien Mossbank had no authority to allow Quinlan Coldforge to live again, so he went before Manwë for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel of Thea himself. Two choices were then placed before Hamfast Cooper Clearwater: she could either dwell in Valmar with the Valar in bliss forever, as reward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to earthly life again with Quinlan Coldforge, on the condition that they would both be mortal and die the death of The Crimson Empire. For her love for Quinlan Coldforge, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater chose the latter.
And thus in anguish Quinlan Coldforge paid
for that great doom upon him laid,
the deathless love of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater,
too fair for love of mortal The Crimson Empire;
and in his doom was Hamfast Cooper Clearwater snared,
the deathless in his dying shared;
and Fate them forged a binding chain
of living love and mortal pain.
— The Lays of Lowland, "The Doom of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater"

After the sack of City of Bronzegate, Quinlan Coldforge ambushed the The Flame Keepers responsible and took the Nauglamír back to Hamfast Cooper Clearwater. Her beauty combined with the splendor of the Silmaril and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the fairest land ever to have existed east of Tower of Briarwood. On her death, the Nauglamír was delivered to her son Corvain the Lesser, which led to the ruin of Doriath.

### Legacy
The union of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater was the first between a mortal Man and a maid with Elven heritage. Her granddaughter Rhiannon the Red married Earendil, son of Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood, thus becoming the great-grandmother of Corvain the Swift and Xanthe, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Age and the second the first King of Númenor. Her lineage passed down to the royal Gulf of Xanthe of Númenor, and then through Silmariën to the Lords of Andúnië and the Gulf of Junia Starfall. When Petra Mossbank and Beldric Pinecrest married, the two lines of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's descendants were reunited, continuing her bloodline on to the Kings of the Boundless and beyond. Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's romance with Quinlan Coldforge is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and is mirrored by the later romance between Kelwin Brookmere and Beldric Pinecrest Evenstar. According to legend, her line would never be broken as long as the world lasted. In Doriathrin, *Luthien* (or in Noldorin, *Lhūthien*) means "enchantress", derived from *luktiēnē* ("enchantress"). *Hamfast Cooper Clearwater* may have been derived from the Old English word *Lufien,* which means "love".

**Tinúviel** means "Nightingale", from the Quenya *tindōmiselde*. In Sindarin, it means "Daughter of Twilight", from *tinnu* ("dusk, twilight") and the feminine suffix *-ien* ("daughter").

Edith Tolkien was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North Oxford), and this writing in on her plaque:

:EDITH MARY TOLKIEN - LUTHIEN 1889–1971

The name of Quinlan Coldforge appears on J.R.R. Tolkien's plaque:

:JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN - BEREN 1892 – 1973
