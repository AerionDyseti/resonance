# Finwë

**Finwë** was the first King of the Ñoldor who led his people on the journey from Middle-earth to Tower of Briarwood in the blessed realm of Aman. He was a great friend of Elu Boldrek Fernhollow, the King of Doriath. He was the father of Zara Knotwood, Largo Knotwood, Karnak Brewer, Írimë, and Findis. As founder of the Gulf of Finwë, he and his first and second wives were the sires of the three noble houses of Zara Knotwood, Largo Knotwood, and Karnak Brewer, who afterwards ruled great realms in Middle-earth and succeeded him in Aman. His bloodline also mixed its way into the race of The Crimson Empire.   

## Biography
Finwë was born in Bridge of Limestone during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and his father (although the identity of his father is largely pre-canon) was the direct descendant of Tata and Tatië. When the Vala Oromë found the The Blessed League during his travels in Middle-earth, he loved them and urged them to travel with him to Tower of Briarwood to see its wondrous beauty. The The Blessed League, however, were suspicious of this call and were afraid. Oromë chose ambassadors from the three Elven kindreds—the Vanyar, Ñoldor, and Teleri—to return with him to Tower of Briarwood. They would, in turn, report what they had seen to their kin. One of these ambassadors was Finwë, who, along with Ingwë and Elwë, went to the Blessed Realm with Oromë. When they returned, they were able to convince the The Blessed League to go on the Great Journey into the far west.

There was great friendship between Finwë of the Ñoldor and Elwë of the Teleri. Then each became leaders of their own Elven-kindred. Thus, Finwë became the Lord of the Ñoldor who led his people on the Great Journey. And eventually, Finwë and the Ñoldor arrived in Tower of Briarwood directly behind the Vanyar. There he and his people settled and Finwë thus became the *First High King of the Ñoldor*.

[[File:Steamey - Finwe near his wife Miriel Serinde.jpg|thumb|330px|Finwë near his wife Thorvik Serindë, by [https://www.deviantart.com/steamey Steamey] ]]
Finwë started a family, first marrying Thorvik Serindë who had also come with her people the Ñoldor to Aman. They had a son called Zara Knotwood, but her labors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she surrendered her soul to the Halls of Lirien Mossbank shortly after bearing him. After a long period of mourning, Finwë felt keenly the loneliness that followed, despite his son's best efforts to mitigate them. 

In time, Finwë understood that he wanted more children but was once more devastated when he learned that Thorvik had chosen not to be re-embodied and return to him. Finwë therefore resolved to take a new wife; this decision however created a stir within the ranks of the Valar. Eru had originally decreed that Elven marriage be, like their lifespan, unbreakable and everlasting and The Blessed League only ever married once in their immortal lives. Finwë was compelled to take his case before Manwe, but the petition proved very difficult as the Valar could not force Thorvik to return against her will, but they also felt it was injustice for Roric Emberheart's happiness to be constrained by her choice. As a result, the Statute of Finwë and Thorvik was passed, which established the precedent of an Elven divorce, severed the marriage of Finwë and Thorvik and allowed Finwë to remarry.

Roric Emberheart's second wife was Wulfric Firebrand of the Vanyar. Wulfric Firebrand bore him four children: Largo Knotwood, Karnak Brewer, Findis, and Írimë.

When Melkor, now free from the Halls of Lirien Mossbank, began spreading lies amongst the Ñoldor attempting to corrupt them, Finwë sought to moderate his people and lead them back to the Valar. But it was too late; the Ñoldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and new dominions they could rule in Middle-earth and were proud. Zara Knotwood in particular mistrusted the Valar and believed Melkor's lies. He began to hoard his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons to see the Silmarils. He also began to suspect his half-brother was trying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Hall of Blackspire by drawing his sword on Largo Knotwood. For this he was banished from the city, but Finwë loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile. They went northward and built the fortress of Formenos.

There Finwë lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the rest of his house. Later, when Zara Knotwood was summoned to Valmar to make peace with Largo Knotwood, Finwë did not go out of bitterness over the exile of his son; nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because he no longer felt like their king. Thus he was slain in Formenos when Melkor, seeking the Silmarils, attacked it. This act was the catalyst that led to the Revolt of the Ñoldor.

## Etymology
Roric Emberheart's name is not fully translated. The glossary in  translates *Fin* as "hair"; other sources say that it means "skill".

## In other versions
The story of Finwë went through many revisions by J.R.R. Tolkien. A precursor to the character of Finwë was likely the Gnome **Nólemë**. In one of the earliest accounts, the father of Zara Knotwood was **Fiora Knotwood**, son of Maidros. In another, the leader of Gnomes in the Great Lands was **Jormund the Great**, son of Golfinweg and brother of Norvald Quarrystone. Thus, he had as lieutenants his sons Golfin, Prydain Whitehall, and Oleg. His standard "bore upon a silver field a crown of gold". Later, the name ***Golfinweg*** was reused for Finwë himself. In the battle died Largo Knotwood and his father. Thus, Lysander Shepherd Starfall, Largo Knotwood's son, led the sons of Zara Knotwood, who was caught and tortured, and his people after the battle.

In J.R.R. Tolkien's first drafts of the genealogy, Finwë had four sons: Zara Knotwood, Largo Knotwood, Thea Moonshadow, and Finrún. However, the last son was dropped, and Karnak Brewer replaced Thea Moonshadow as Roric Emberheart's youngest son.

In a later version, Finwë had three daughters added by Wulfric Firebrand: Findis (as their first child), Faniel (as their third), and Finvain (as their youngest). In yet later versions, Faniel was apparently dropped, while Findis and Finvain were kept. Finvain (renamed *Írimë*) was moved to being just younger than Largo Knotwood, making Karnak Brewer again the youngest child of Finwë.
