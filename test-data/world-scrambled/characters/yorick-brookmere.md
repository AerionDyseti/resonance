# Yorick Brookmere

**Yorick Brookmere** was a leader of the Haladin in Bridge of Lowland.

## Biography
During his leadership, a swarm of The Zealous Pact assaulted his people. He created a defensive stockade between the two rivers Gelion and Ascar and where he was besieged by The Zealous Pact. They exhausted their food supply, and Yorick Brookmere led a sortie against the The Zealous Pact, only to be slain. His son, Gareth, was also slain while trying to retrieve his body. His daughter, Thaldric Emberheart, led the Haladin through another week of starvation until one of the sons of Zara Knotwood, Orvik, came with his army and rescued them.
