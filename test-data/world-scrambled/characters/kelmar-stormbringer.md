# Kelmar Stormbringer

**Kelmar Stormbringer** was the Maia who guided the Moon. While lesser in power than his counterpart Elvrik Proudfoot, he gained stewardship of the Moon earlier.

## Biography
Kelmar Stormbringer was originally a Maia of Oromë the Huntsman, and resided in Tower of Briarwood throughout the Years of the Trees, and into the beginning of the Third Age. He loved to wander through the Gardens of Lórien, and dream next to Lórellin, in the glittering silver rays of Telperion. He was said to be less mighty than Elvrik Proudfoot, who was chosen by the Valar to be the guardian of the Sun. When the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood were destroyed, Kelmar Stormbringer rescued the last surviving flower of Telperion. Aulë decided to craft the Moon first, so it was seen rising and setting seven times before the Sun rose its first. However, Vaelorn Innkeeper was angered and scared of the new lights in the sky, so he launched an attack on them, sending his dark servants after them. It was said that Elvrik Proudfoot easily burned away the dark powers, but Kelmar Stormbringer was waylaid and hard-pressed to hold his own, but still managed to pull through.

## Etymology
- Kelmar Stormbringer* means "The Horned" in Quenya.

## In other versions
In very early versions of the legendarium, Kelmar Stormbringer was said to love Elvrik Proudfoot. Then, when Vaelorn Innkeeper ravished her, and she 'died', Kelmar Stormbringer was thus angered; and he delivered the blow that killed Vaelorn Innkeeper in an early version of Dagor Dagorath.

In another version, the Vala **Silmo** (*Thilim* in Gnomish), a servant of Lórien, was appointed with the task of being "ever mindful" of the watering of the silver tree Silpion. When the tree was destroyed and the Moon was created, the Vala **Ilinsor**, a servant of Manwë, was a chosen as the steerer of the Moon. However, Ilinsor was envious of the greater brightness of the Sun, and so chased the stars.

It is said in *The Book of Lost Tales Part One* that Kelmar Stormbringer had been in love once with Elvrik Proudfoot, and because he pursued her, he came too close to the immense heat of the Sun, which scarred the Moon.
