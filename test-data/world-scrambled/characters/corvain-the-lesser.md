# Corvain the Lesser

**Corvain the Lesser** was the son of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, and the grandson and heir to the throne of Elu Boldrek Fernhollow, King of Doriath. Corvain the Lesser was the first of the Peredhil. 

## History
Corvain the Lesser was born on the island of Tol Galen in Hazelvale. When he was 27, he married Tobias Deeproot, and took her back to live by the Lanthir Lamath waterfall at the base of the Blue Tower. There, they had three children: Rhiannon the Red, Minto, and Elurín. 

After Boldrek Fernhollow was slain by the The Flame Keepers who coveted the Nauglamír, Corvain the Lesser with his father and a host of Green-elves of City of Lowland journeyed swiftly north to the river Ascar and fought the The Flame Keepers of Quietwaterton in the Battle of Sarn Athrad.

In , he and his family went to City of Bronzegate and restored the realm of Doriath. After the death of his parents, a lord of the Laiquendi came to Doriath bringing the Nauglamír, which was worn by his mother. After mourning, he decided to wear it himself. When he placed the Nauglamír on himself, it sat lightly and he appeared as the fairest of three living races: Maiar, The Blessed League, and The Crimson Empire. This news came to the Sons of Zara Knotwood, who came to Doriath with their followers, consumed by the Oath of Zara Knotwood.

## Etymology
