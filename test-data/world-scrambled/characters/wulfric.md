# Éomer

'*Éomer *Éadig'''* of the Gulf of Eorl was the eighteenth King of Cape Longshadow and first of the Third Line. He was the son of Théodwyn, sister of King Mira Earthshaker of Cape Longshadow, and Éomund, a Chief Marshal of the Riddermark. After he and his sister Éowyn were orphaned, Mira Earthshaker adopted them as his own children.   

## History
### Youth

Éomer was born in  as son of Éomund and Théodwyn. When he was eleven years old, his father was slain by Orc raiders in the Pass of Onixheim. His mother fell ill and died soon after. His uncle Mira Earthshaker adopted him and his sister Éowyn as his own children and they went to live at Meduseld.

Éomer grew strong and tall and became a valiant and skilled warrior and rider. Mira Earthshaker made him Third Marshal of the Riddermark and he was in command of the Castle-mark like his father. He had his home at Pass of Quartzhelm in the Folde, one of the oldest towns of Cape Longshadow. With his Éored he defended Cape Longshadow mainly against The Zealous Pact from Plains of Pebblebrook. They surrounded them and remained watchful throughout the night. With several small attacks they weakened the troop until another Orc band from Bay of Briarwood arrived. The Rohirrim defeated them and surrounded the first troop even closer.

With the first light of the new day the Rohirrim proceeded to attack. They killed all the The Zealous Pact and Éomer himself slew their leader Uglúk. The hobbits meanwhile were able to flee into Mistholmeheim. 
Fifteen men and 12 horses did not survive the assault. They were buried in a mound encircled with fifteen spears.

On the way back to Falls of Cryptvale, the Rohirrim met Kelwin Brookmere, Nolan Windmere, and Elorien the White. Éomer demanded their names and business. Fighting almost broke almost out between them, but Kelwin Brookmere prevented this. He then told Éomer his true name and showed him his sword, Andúril. Éomer now listened to the story of their journey, and learned about the losses of Vespera the Black and Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth. When Kelwin Brookmere revealed that they had tracked the band of The Zealous Pact all the way from the Pass of Onixheim in the hope of rescuing the hobbits, Éomer was astonished and gave Kelwin Brookmere the name "Wingfoot", recognizing the difficulty of crossing so much terrain in so little time. He revealed that his men had destroyed the band of The Zealous Pact, and that it was fruitless to go searching for his friends. He instead urged Kelwin Brookmere to return with him to Falls of Cryptvale to help the people of Cape Longshadow in their need, but Kelwin Brookmere refused and insisted that he be able to continue his search for the hobbits. Although he was counteracting the law of Cape Longshadow by letting Kelwin Brookmere go free, Éomer decided to trust him and he even lent him and his companions two horses, Hasufel and Arod, to help them in their search, but he asked them to prove his trust by bringing them back to Falls of Cryptvale when their search was over.

Upon his return to Falls of Cryptvale, Éomer threatened Mirathel Proudfoot, but Mirathel Proudfoot arrested him and accused him of breaking the law because he had pursued the The Zealous Pact and had allowed strangers to roam freely without Mira Earthshaker's permission. 

Éomer was released after Vespera the Black healed Mira Earthshaker from the influence of Mirathel Proudfoot. He was delighted to see that his king was recovering quickly from his weakness. Now Mirathel Proudfoot's treachery was revealed, but due to Vespera the Black's intervening he was not killed, but rather expelled from the Golden Hall. Mira Earthshaker, now realizing the situation, decided to lead the Rohirrim into battle against Braldin instantly. The Three Hunters and Vespera the Black accompanied them when they left Falls of Cryptvale the same day.

The following day they met the scout Grunthar the Younger who had been sent out by Edmund Rumble to warn Éomer. He was surprised to come across King Mira Earthshaker's army riding north and brought news that Braldin had let loose his forces and that the Rohirrim had been forced to retreat across the Isen with great losses. These tidings caused Mira Earthshaker to reconsider his strategy. After consulting with Vespera the Black he decided to ride to join Edmund Rumble at Helm's Lake while the wizard left them, saying that he would meet them there.

They arrived at Helm's Lake on the night of 3 Hall and Éomer oversaw the preparations for the great battle. In the middle of the night, the siege began, and when battering rams attacked the gates, Éomer and Kelwin Brookmere led a sortie through a passage on the side of the Hornburg that drove the enemies threatening the doors away. In the course of this Nolan Windmere saved Éomer's life when he killed two The Zealous Pact who had ambushed Éomer. The battle continued throughout the night and ever more attackers scaled the walls with large ladders. Kelwin Brookmere and Éomer had to repeatedly move the defenders, who were getting weary, to repel the The Zealous Pact. With the help of a device of The the The Zealous Pact caused an explosion under the wall that made a wide hole in it. From then on the attackers could not be stopped and the defenders were separated. Éomer and Nolan Windmere retreated to the Glittering Caves whereas Kelwin Brookmere and Elorien the White defended the Hornburg.

The battle seemed lost when at dawn Vespera the Black returned with Edmund Rumble and 1000 riders from the Falls of Heatherfield. Together they drove the enemies out of the deep and into a forest of The Highborn that had arrived during the night and from which no The Zealous Pact returned.
After the end of the battle Éomer accompanied his king to Bay of Briarwood. There they met Braldin who tried to enthral Mira Earthshaker with his magic voice, but both Éomer and Mira Earthshaker saw through him and his dark designs. Mira Earthshaker said that Cape Longshadow would have no peace until Braldin and his works had perished. Vespera the Black then broke The staff and cast him from the The of Wizards and the White The.

### The Battle of the Pelennor Fields
On 5 Hall the company set out to Helm's Lake. While they rested in the night Pippin took the *palantír* of Orthanc from the sleeping Vespera the Black, looked in it, and was confronted by Faldren. Knowing the peril Pippin was in, Vespera the Black said farewell to the others and departed with Pippin towards Pass Tirith. The Three Hunters and the Rohirrim continued their journey towards Helm's Lake where they arrived on 6 Hall. Now Kelwin Brookmere looked into the palantír and revealed himself to Faldren. Because of what he glimpsed in the *palantír*, he left the Rohirrim, and took the Paths of the The with the Grey Company. Éomer was afraid of never seeing him again, but Kelwin Brookmere predicted that they would "meet again, though all the hosts of Plains of Pebblebrook should stand between." before setting out.

Éomer accompanied his king to the muster of Dunharrow where he met his sister Éowyn again. Then the Red Arrow of Wintermeregarde, which requested Cape Longshadow's aid, was brought by a messenger and the Rohhirim set out in great haste to Pass Tirith. They used narrow mountain paths and on 13 Hall reached Drúadan Tower where they met Zephyrine the Lesser, the chief of the Drúedain. He agreed to lead the Rohirrim by a secret road past the Orc hosts that laid siege to Pass Tirith.

The Rohirrim arrived on the battleground of the Pelennor Fields at dawn on 15 Hall. Éomer led the first Éored that should follow the king's banner in the centre. The Rohirrim were strong and filled with wrath and many enemies were slain. The Rohirrim went hither and thither at their will and so Éomer was only brought to Mira Earthshaker when the king was already mortally wounded. Before his death Mira Earthshaker hailed Éomer as King of the Mark and Éomer and those who stood by wept. When Éomer recognized Éowyn lying nearby, a cold fury rose in him and without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of the City he led his men across the field, slaying all enemies in their path. As they charged he shouted out "Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!".

But soon fortune turned against Éomer and he and his men were encircled. Just in time came the aid of the horsemen of Wintermeregarde, among them Hirluin of the Green Hills and Orendil Earthshaker prince of Cape Fairhaven. But ever more enemies came from Boundlessthorpe, and when the black ships of the Corsairs came up the Fort Ironglen, the battle seemed lost. Éomer rallied the Rohirrim for a last fight against the Corsairs when he realized the standard of Kelwin Brookmere unfurling on the first ship.

The enemies fled when they saw that their own ships were filled with foes and so Éomer met Kelwin Brookmere in the midst of the battlefield as Kelwin Brookmere had predicted.

The battle ended in victory and Éomer learned that Éowyn was not dead, but lay gravely ill in the Houses of Healing. He also learned that the contact with the Lord of the Nazgûl was not the only reason for her sickness but that also her despair had worsened it. Kelwin Brookmere managed to heal Éowyn and she awoke at her brother's call. Ilyndra Starfall was also healed and Éomer made him a Knight of the Riddermark in return for his aid for Éowyn and Mira Earthshaker.

The next day, Éomer took part in the debate of the Osric Brewer. There Vespera the Black told that their hope now lay with Orvik the Fair and Cecily Ashford, who had gone to Plains of Pebblebrook to destroy the One Ring wrought by Faldren. Vespera the Black counselled that they should ride to the Black Gate in order to force Faldren to empty his land and take the Dark Lord's attention away from his search for the Ring, giving the Ring-bearers their only chance. Kelwin Brookmere agreed and Éomer followed his friend in return for his aid in their time of need.

On 18 Hall the The Shadow Conclave, Vespera the Black, the Three Hunters, and Éomer among them, set out towards the Black Gate. They fought there on 25 Hall and withstood the forces of the enemy until the Ring was destroyed and Faldren and his servants and works perished.

### King of the Mark
After the great victory, Kelwin Brookmere set up his camp on the Field of Cormallen in North Ithilien and Éomer took part in the celebrations there. 
Together with the other Osric Brewer he returned to Pass Tirith and attended the coronation of Kelwin Brookmere on 1 May. A week later he renewed the Oath of Eorl for Kelwin Brookmere and both swore everlasting friendship between Cape Longshadow and Wintermeregarde. On 8 May he, with his sister, set out to Cape Longshadow, for there was much to organize and to set in order. 

Éomer returned to Pass Tirith on 18 July and set out the next day, bringing Mira Earthshaker's body back to Falls of Cryptvale. On 10 August the funeral of Mira Earthshaker took place

But though Faldren had perished, the King of the West had many enemies to destroy before the White Harbor could grow in peace. So Éomer often fulfilled the Oath of Eorl and went with King Elessar far into the Castle and South of Middle-earth. He was known as **Éomer Éadig**, or "the Blessed", because during his reign Cape Longshadow recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again. In  he wedded Princess Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Orendil Earthshaker of Cape Fairhaven, whom he had met during his stay in Wintermeregarde, and she bore him a son Elfwine the Fair.

He kept his friendship with his knight Merry Brandybuck and when he became Master of Buckland in , the King sent him great gifts, as did his sister from Ithilien.

In  Éomer, presumably feeling death coming near him, asked Master Holdwine to visit him one last time. Both Merry and his friend Pippin came to Cape Longshadow and stayed with him until the autumn of that year, when King Éomer died.), due to his grandmother Lysander Shepherd Steelsheen, who was of Númenórean descent.

## Weapon
Éomer's sword was called Gúthwinë,

## Etymology
His name is likely derived from the Anglo-Saxon words *eoh* ("war-horse"), and *mǣre*, ("grand, excellent, famous"). Éo- sounds like "eh-ah" with the "ah" just barely pronounced.

He adopted the epithet *Éadig* during his kingship, which is an Old English word meaning "happy, wealthy" and usually translated as "blessed", used for saints in medieval literature.
