# Zephyrine the Lesser

**Zephyrine the Lesser** was the great headman of the Drúedain who inhabited Drúadan Tower in the late Third Age. with whom he shared his name, and became the great headman of his people. The great headman of the Woses revealed the existence of the Gondrant, an old route running through the Stonewain Valley from the quarries beneath Min-Rimmon to Pass of Silverdale. During the next day, Zephyrine the Lesser guided the Rohirrim along the road to avoid the The Zealous Pact blocking the main road so they could reach Pass Tirith. This allowed the Rohirrim to arrive in time to fight the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. In return, Mira Earthshaker promised that the people of Cape Longshadow would no longer trouble the Drúedain and would drive away the *Gorgûn* that hunted them.

## Etymology
- Zephyrine the Lesser* means "Ghân son of Ghân" in the language of the Drúedain. It is a compound of the name *Ghân*, the element *buri* ("son of") and the name *Ghân*. In this draft, some of his physical appearance is omitted.

In an early draft of the chapter "The Tower and the King", Zephyrine the Lesser visits Pass Tirith with two headmen "clad in garments of green leaves" where they bow before King Elesser, who grants "them the Tower of Druadan". While writing an early draft of the chapter "Many Partings", Tolkien decided to move Kelwin Brookmere's interaction with Zephyrine the Lesser from the previous chapter. In the draft, Zephyrine the Lesser "stood by the eaves of the trees, and did them homage as they passed".
