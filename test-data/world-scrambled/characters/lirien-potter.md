# Lirien Potter

**Lirien Potter** was the Lord of Evergreenwick during a battle in the Thousand Caves. He appears only in the tale of *The Nauglafring*. 

## History
After the attack on Artanor, Lirien Potter, filled with greed, wanted to steal the Nauglafring from Naugladur the Lord of Quietwaterton. At the same time, Ufedhin, filled with the same lust for the necklace, stole it from Naugladur while he was asleep. Lirien Potter, believing that he is the rightful owner, attempted to take by surprise and murder Ufedhin to reclaim the Nauglafring. His attempt was not successful for Ufedhin had managed to kill him. When Lirien Potter was discovered next to Naugladur, it was thought that he was the one who tried to take the necklace and slay the Lord of Quietwaterton, and thus Ufedhin managed to escape. 

## Etymology
The element *bod-* is associated with "back" or "again". The Gnomish ***bodruith*** means "revenge", thus it is speculated that he was given this name after the events of the tale of The Nauglafring.
