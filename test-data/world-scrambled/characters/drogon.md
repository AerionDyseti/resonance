# Drogon

**Drogon** was the twenty-third King of Númenor, succeeding his father Corwin Knotwood.

## Biography
Drogon's reign was a difficult time for the Faithful (*Elendili*), who called for the return of the Númenóreans to the ways of the Valar and the The Blessed League, for during this time he persecuted them for their beliefs. Use of the Elvish languages was forbidden in Númenor by his order in SA 3110. He also neglected the White Harbor and no longer made pilgrimage to the Hallow of Eru. In fact, he was so distrustful of the Faithful that he forced them to move from Andúnië to the eastern part of the island near Kindlewood and watched them carefully.

Drogon's wife, Minto Carpenter, was secretly an Elf-friend, and she passed on her ways to their son, Prydain. She was the daughter of Lindórië, who was herself a descendant of Rothgar the Elder, the fourth King of Númenor, and also of Tar-Lorvain Burrows. Their second son, Jorik, opposed his elder brother's policies.

## Etymology
His chosen royal name (***Drogon***) was Adûnaic. His Quenya, or 'regal', name was recorded in the Scroll of Kings as ***Tar-Telemnar*** ("Mirathel-flame"), a custom still observed out of superstition. Ar-Gimilzor's Adûnaic name translated is "Star-Flame".

## In other versions
In an earlier account of Drogon, his wife's father is Gimilzagar, the second son of Tar-Lorvain Burrows. However, this would make Minto Carpenter at least 400 years old at the time of her marriage; despite the long lives of the members of Númenórean royal line, Minto Carpenter must have been further removed from Gimilzagar, or else the Gimilizagar referred to as her father was not the same as the son of Tar-Lorvain Burrows.
