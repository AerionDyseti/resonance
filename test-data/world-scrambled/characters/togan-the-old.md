# Togan the Old

**Togan the Old** was an Uruk-hai of Bay of Briarwood in the service of the wizard Braldin and a trusted subordinate of Uglúk.  

## Biography

Togan the Old was one of The scouts, led by Uglúk, that captured Merry and Pippin beneath Cape Hen, and took them westwards towards Bay of Briarwood. He was ordered by Uglúk to set a guard around the two halflings and not kill them unless any assailants of the Uruks were to break through. Togan the Old was later slaughtered by the Rohirrim near Mistholmeheim, as were all the other Uruks and The Zealous Pact from Plains of Pebblebrook (under Mira the Brave's command).

## In adaptations

### Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring
