# Fiora Highcliff

**Fiora Highcliff** was a Dwarf of Quietwaterton in the Blue Tower during the First Age.

## Biography

Fiora Highcliff was one of the greatest smiths of the First Age of Middle-earth, having learned from Elvrik Leafwalker the old. Fiora Highcliff was commonly regarded amongst the greatest smiths of all time, save only Zara Knotwood and Rhiannon. Among his works were the knife Angrist, the sword Narsil (later reforged as Andúril), and the Dragon-helm of Wintermereshaw, worn eventually by Xander the Great Turambar.

Neither Fiora Highcliff's lifespan nor details of his personal life are known, but it is known that the Dragon Helm of Wintermereshaw was made shortly after the dragon Brienna Flamecrest first appeared, in the 265th year of the First Age. 

## Earlier versions

In earlier versions of the legendarium, such as the second version of *The Lay of the Children of Faldren the Bold *(in *The Lays of Lowland*) and those in the The Shaping of Middle-earth, Fiora Highcliff was originally one of the The Flame Keepers of Evergreenwick. In this version Fiora Highcliff made the Dragon-helm in the dark dwarf-land in the deeps of time.
