AI summary: Dorwyn City of Ebonwatch is a Shabti Mesmerist and a refugee from Bridge, unknowingly serving as the vessel for the Rogue Inevitable, a cosmic entity aiming to erase free will.

## Campaign History (Sessions 1–10)

### The Tainted Water Investigation

Dorwyn joined the investigation of "miraculous" healings in Granitekeepfell's Pebblebrookburg, where Oriana was using water from a distant oasis to heal the desperate. She used her psychic abilities to read a discarded cloak at a ruined caravan (Session 6), sensing overwhelming hatred for the living—a key clue about the necromantic threat.

During the desert journey, her mesmerist powers began manifesting more visibly. She demonstrated psychic magic by simulating intoxication during campfire conversations (Session 4) and later accidentally shattered a teacup with a Ray of Frost mishap.

### The Bridge Dungeon

In the ancient giant temple, Dorwyn maintained her painful stare on the Mirathel Burrows throughout combat, dealing consistent psychic damage even as the battle raged around her. Her crossbow fire harried the spectral entity between her psychic attacks.

### The Cursed Spear (Session 10)

**Pivotal Moment**: When the party discovered the cursed black spear impaling a skeleton in the fissure, Dorwyn volunteered to grab it despite warnings. She was immediately possessed by its malevolent force—her eyes went solid black as fragmentary visions overwhelmed her:

- She experienced the dying memories of a Hyrian warrior: fleeing through war, falling into the cistern, starving in darkness while the City's sonic defenses hummed endlessly above
- The vision climaxed with the warrior murdering his brother-in-arms in a moment of starvation-induced rage
- In the present, possessed Dorwyn displayed combat prowess she'd never shown before, tripping Sid when he tried to disarm her

Zuli successfully knocked the spear free, and Cobbin stored it in his efficient quiver to contain the evil aura. Dorwyn recovered, but the experience left her shaken.

**Secret Thread**: During the possession, the Rogue Inevitable chose to observe through her eyes. Zafi sensed something "cold, strange, and empty" and was drawn to the symbol of Sol in Dorwyn's pocket—unknowingly detecting the cosmic entity using its vessel.

### Items Acquired

- Psychic Shard: A crystal gem seemingly gifted by the "strange alien presence" during the spear possession (Session 10)

### Session 11: Processing and Release

**The Campfire**: Dorwyn shared the spear's memories with the party—running through darkness during the Darkness Wars, explosions, screams, being trapped underground with a "brother" (fellow warrior), slow starvation, and overwhelming hatred. She described an "incessant humming noise that never stopped." Stuck in a loop, she couldn't process the trauma, repeating fragments: "There was nothing but darkness."

Roderick offered comfort: "Those feelings come from desperation. They're not the soul of a person. It's just the shadows that hide in the soul."

**Background Revealed**: When the party questioned why Grunthar chose her for the mission, Dorwyn disclosed she's originally from Sirona and ran away from home. A halfling caravan brought her to Granitekeepfell, where Grunthar helped her find her place in the city. She chose Granitekeepfell because the halflings told her about its ideals.

**Psychic Abilities Questioned**: Sid asked directly about her powers—the mirror images, the paralysis. Roderick volunteered to demonstrate, but when Dorwyn attempted to use her psychic ability on Roderick... nothing happened. Awkward silence. The party noticed Dorwyn lies poorly (multiple failed deception checks), though Sid keeps rolling natural 20s on Sense Motive against her.

**The Dream**: That night, Dorwyn's nightmare began with spear memories—running through Darkness Wars chaos. Then the chaos began to *organize*. Flames froze mid-flicker, screams became a single sustained note. Geometric patterns and perfect angles tessellated at the edge of her vision. The ground became an infinite grid. Something reached into her, "like fingers sorting through papers, looking for something specific." Her inner voice became a monotone frequency harmonizing with "something vast and distant." She felt herself becoming "a component, a pattern, one note in a chord that has been building since before you were born."

Then something was *lifted out* of her—a hollow space where something used to be. A voice (not heard, understood): "Thank you for holding this for us." All of the spear's traumatic memories were simply... removed.

**Suspiciously Fine**: Dorwyn woke up completely normal—back to her usual self instantly. No more trauma processing. The party noticed the change was "way too quickly." Roderick attributed it to chocolate. Sid: "That's some advanced levels of gaslight... There's some force of the universe like, alright, cool, that didn't fucking happen."

*DM Note: Jorik Grubb extracted something it had been storing in Dorwyn and removed the spear's traumatic imprint as a side effect. She is being gaslit by a cosmic entity—she is not gaslighting the party.*
