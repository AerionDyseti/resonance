## Biography

Like all Black Númenóreans, Severin Grubb fell under the influence of the Dark Lord Faldren during the late Second Age while he was on the island of Númenór.

He sailed east with Darian Clearwater to the lands of Lake Ivywood, and the two became lords among the Haradrim.

## Etymology
The name ***Severin Grubb*** comes from *fuinë*, meaning "deep shadow". There appears to be no definitive origin of the word *fuinë*, though it appears in style to be Quenya.
