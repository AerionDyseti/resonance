## Biography

Zara Whitehall was born into a politically controversial family in the elven forest of Falls of Greenhill. Her family's progressive political stance regarding the separation of religious and governmental power was the rumor of every conversation about her. Eventually, their vocal opposition to the theocratic system led to their ostracization from the community.

Rather than allowing this setback to define her path, Zara channeled her experiences into academic pursuit, earning admission to the prestigious College of Moonrisedale. Her keen intellect and determination quickly set her apart from her peers, and she developed a particular interest in magical artifacts and their historical significance.

This passion led her to join the The Old Circle, where her leadership qualities and expertise in artifact research propelled her through the ranks. Eventually, she assumed leadership of the guild. Despite it’s unpopularity, the guild has made numerous significant discoveries under her guidance that expanded magical knowledge and understanding.

A pivotal moment in Zara's life came when she encountered the The. Recognizing the immense potential for collaboration between these powerful individuals and the magical resources of Moonrisedale, she made the bold decision to invoke an obscure clause in the Isle’s charter, allowing her to take a position on the city-state's The in order to advocate for the The's access to Moonrisedale's vast repositories of magical knowledge and power.

Following the recent destabilization of the The and the subsequent upheaval in Moonrisedale, Zara was forced to abandon her position and seek refuge elsewhere. She now resides in the Ironglenwood, where she has found solace in studying an ancient Elven Forge. This focus on academic pursuit serves as both a distraction and a coping mechanism, keeping her thoughts far from the political chaos and personal losses she has endured. Through her research of the forge's mysteries, she seeks to rebuild not just her understanding of ancient elven craft, but perhaps also her sense of purpose.
