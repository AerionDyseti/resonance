## Description

Known simply as "Boldrek the Red" to most, this ancient black dragonborn is one of the last remaining elders of her kind. Her scales, once gleaming obsidian, have dulled to a weathered gray, marking her advanced years. Despite her age, she carries herself with dignity and purpose, serving as both a spiritual leader and living historian for her dwindling people.

## History

In her youth, Boldrek the Red was a formidable warrior who defended the dragonborn settlements of City of Clearbrook against numerous threats. Now, she dedicates herself to preserving the ancient traditions and knowledge of her race, understanding that each passing year brings them closer to extinction. The loss of draconic magic from the land has meant fewer and fewer dragonborn hatchlings, a reality she faces with stoic determination.

While she rarely speaks of it, Boldrek the Red is one of the few remaining dragonborn who remembers the exact moment when the draconic magic began to fade from the land. She keeps this memory close to her heart, along with the hope that perhaps, somewhere in the world, there might still be a way to restore what was lost.

## Relationships

Her wisdom is sought by many, both dragonborn and other races alike. She often serves as a mediator in disputes and offers counsel to those in need. Despite the weight of her responsibilities and the shadow of extinction looming over her people, Boldrek the Red maintains a warm demeanor and dry sense of humor, often sharing ancient dragonborn proverbs with a knowing smile.

Boldrek the Red maintains a vast collection of scrolls and artifacts in her modest dwelling, documenting the history, customs, and magical practices of the dragonborn. She spends much of her time teaching the younger generations about their heritage and the significance of their draconic bloodline. Though she knows her people's fate may be sealed, she believes that their legacy must survive even if their race does not.
