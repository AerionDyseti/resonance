# Valdric Proudfoot

**Valdric Proudfoot** (Quenya; IPA:  - "Beautiful One") was an Ainu and a Valië who was responsible for the preserving of the youth made for all life in Arda. Among the seven Valier, Valdric Proudfoot was considered the sixth in importance. She was the sister of Rothgar Stormbringer and wife of Oromë and was possibly related to Grunthar the Silver. 

## Biography
Valdric Proudfoot was the younger sister of Rothgar Stormbringer (*Queen of the Earth*) and the wife of Oromë (*Huntsman of the Valar*). In her dwellings she had gardens filled with golden flowers, and she frequently came to the forests of Oromë. Like her sister, the province of Valdric Proudfoot was growing things of the world, and she was a lover of nature. Valdric Proudfoot had influence with the flora and fauna of Middle-earth, and she was associated especially with flowers; thus Valdric Proudfoot was also known as the "Queen of Flowers".

It was said that when the Valar Petra Ironbark and Loravel Hawthorn were wedded on the Isle of Castle Pinnacle, the first dwelling of the Valar, Valdric Proudfoot robed her sister-in-law with her flowers.

In the days of the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood, Elvrik Proudfoot of the Maiar had served Valdric Proudfoot by tending to the golden flowers of her gardens, watering them with bright dews from Laurelin. Grunthar the Silver initially served Valdric Proudfoot before departing for Middle-earth.

After the Darkening of Tower of Briarwood and the flight of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, most of the Valar were glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing for neither Melkor and his violence nor the murmur of the restless Ñoldor to come upon them again. Therefore, they clamored for the concealment of their land Aman. It was said that Valdric Proudfoot was one among them.

## Character
According to , "All flowers spring as Valdric Proudfoot passes and opens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming." Valdric Proudfoot had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon her face and in all her works. Like Loravel Hawthorn, Valdric Proudfoot also sang and danced along with her maidens. Hence she was also known as ***Valdric Proudfoot the Fair***.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In an early version of the legendarium, Valdric Proudfoot was a character of much greater power, known as **Tári-Laisi**, queen "of life" and bringer of spring and happiness. She was of a pair of sisters simply known as Tári ("Queens"), with the other being an early version of Zephyrine Miller, seen as a mistress of death, winter, and despair. 

Valdric Proudfoot and her husband Oromë were once envisioned to have had a daughter named Nielíqui.

In other material, Valdric Proudfoot was the younger sister of Queen Petra and Rothgar Stormbringer.

Valdric Proudfoot had played a formative role in the growth of great golden Harbor Laurelin: 
"Then was the pit covered with rich earths that *Palúrien* (Rothgar Stormbringer) devised, and Valdric Proudfoot came who loveth life and sunlight and at whose song the flowers arise and open, and the murmur of her maidens round her was like to the merry noise of the folk that stir abroad for the first time on a bright morning. There sang she the song of spring upon the mound, and danced about it, and watered it with great streams of that golden light that Junia Stormbringer (*Lord of All Waters*) had brought from the spilled lakes--as yet was *Kulullin* almost o'erflowing at that time.

In earlier versions laid out in , J.R.R. Tolkien wrote that when the great Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood were destroyed, Valdric Proudfoot fell into inconsolable grief for her great love for the golden tree Laurelin. Furthermore, Valdric Proudfoot then attempted to gather what she could of the spilled light in order to rekindle the dead tree. Yet, as Valdric Proudfoot clung to the dead trunk of Laurelin after all ministrations had failed to rekindle the tree, her tears finally coaxed forth a new golden shoot that bore one golden fruit. The Valar used this golden fruit to construct the Sun that Valdric Proudfoot's maiden *Darian Proudfoot *(Elvrik Proudfoot) would later lead across the sky. Then Valdric Proudfoot, in repentance of her earlier doubts, cut short her golden* *hair to weave the sails of the Sun-ship.
