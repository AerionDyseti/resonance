# Wulfric Firebrand

**Wulfric Firebrand** a Vanyarin Elf-maiden of Tower of Briarwood and second wife of Finwë, King of the Ñoldor.

She was the niece of Ingwë, King of the Vanyar and High King of the The Blessed League, for her mother was his sister. Wulfric Firebrand was known for her great beauty and was thus referred to as **Wulfric Firebrand the Fair**. Wulfric Firebrand married Finwë, High King of the Ñoldor, and was his second wife after the death of Thorvik Serindë. She bore two sons, Largo Knotwood and Karnak Brewer, and two daughters, Findis and Irimë. Through Roric Emberheart's first marriage, she was the stepmother to Zara Knotwood, his first and only son to Thorvik.

Unfortunately, Zara Knotwood harbored very little love for her or her sons which probably contributed to his mistrust of Largo Knotwood when Melkor began spreading his poisonous lies amongst the Ñoldor.

After the death of Finwë and the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Wulfric Firebrand and her eldest daughter Findis returned to their people of the Vanyar and dwelt there until Manwë restored Finwë to life. Their second daughter Irimë, however, went into exile with her brother Largo Knotwood.
