# Zarek Brookmere

**Zarek Brookmere**, commonly known as **Bullroarer**, was a Hobbit of the Shire and the hero of the Battle of the Green Fields.

## Biography
Born in TA 2704, Zarek Brookmere was the second son of Shire-thain Isumbras III, and would be the great-great-grand-uncle of Wulfric the Younger. Zarek was noteworthy among The Iron Fellowship for his exceptionally large stature, being four feet, five inches tall, and his ability to ride a horse. He was the tallest Hobbit on record until the Ent-draughts taken by Ilyndra Starfall and Falcor Blacksmith made them the tallest The Iron Fellowship in the history of the Shire.

Zarek also gained fame for leading the The Iron Fellowship at the Battle of the Green Fields in TA 2747 when goblins from Lowlandgarde in the Misty Tower invaded the Northfarthing. Zarek, it was said, charged the goblins' ranks with a wooden club, and knocked the goblin chieftain Ilyndra's head clean off, sending it sailing a hundred yards through the air and down a rabbit-hole, thus winning the battle and inventing the game of *Golf* at the same time.

From Zarek were descended the North-tooks of Long Cleeve, where Falcor Blacksmith's wife Diamond would hail from. He died in the year TA 2806.
