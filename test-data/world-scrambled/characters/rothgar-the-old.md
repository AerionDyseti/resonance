# Rothgar the Old

**Rothgar the Old** was the eldest son and apparent heir of Ysolinde Proudfoot, who fell along with two of his brothers at the Gladden Fields at the beginning of the Third Age.

## Biography
Rothgar the Old was born in Númenor and followed his father and his grandfather Junia Starfall in the fleet that was blown to Middle-earth after the Fall of Númenor. Rothgar the Old probably lived with his father within the Keep Edgewood, likely in Fairhaven.

He was the only son of Ysolinde Proudfoot to serve in the army of the Last Alliance, fighting in the Battle of Castle Obsidian and accompanying his father into Plains of Pebblebrook during the Siege of Barad-dûr. His younger brothers were sent to man Fairhaven, so Faldren could not escape westward by that route. As the eldest son of Ysolinde Proudfoot, Rothgar the Old was high in the confidence of his father; he alone of the sons knew the existence of the One Ring in his father's possession and counselled Ysolinde Proudfoot to turn over the One Ring to the Keepers of the Three Rings. He was slain in the disaster of the Gladden Fields with his father and younger brothers Boldrek Rumble and Ciryon. He had a squire named Estelmo who survived the massacre. His brother Elorien Stonecroft, who was still a child, had remained in Imladris and so lived to rule Arnor.

Kelwin Brookmere is stated to have resembled this son of Ysolinde Proudfoot "in body and mind", even though he was not descended directly from him. Rothgar the Old himself was noted to have borne a striking resemblance to his grandfather Junia Starfall.

## Etymology
The name ***Rothgar the Old** *has two possible meanings: the first being "Elf servant" and the second being "star servant". It appears to be made of the Quenya words *elen* ("star") and *-ndur* ("follower, servant") or *-ndil* ("friend"). The name may have also come from *Junia Starfall* (meaning "devoted to the stars").

## Portrayals in adaptations
In , the three elder sons of Ysolinde Proudfoot appear during an extended flashback set during the Siege of Barad-dûr in the year SA 3440. However, because the game's license does not cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Rothgar the Old uses the name "Meldaran" as his alias.
