# Aerindel the Black

**Aerindel the Black** was a Ñoldorin Elf, the third son of Karnak Brewer, elder brother of Barlo Lightfoot, younger brother of Thea Moonshadow Felagund and Cobbin Leafwalker and lord of the Ñoldor of Hall of Evergreen in the First Age.

## Biography

Aerindel the Black was born in Hall of Blackspire sometime during the Noontide of Tower of Briarwood. When Zara Knotwood spoke in Hall of Blackspire, Aerindel the Black was moved by his words as was his brother but neither spoke against their father; however, he and his brothers followed the host of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth. When the Ñoldor returned to Middle-earth, he together with Cobbin Leafwalker held the northern slopes of the highlands of Hall of Evergreen against Vaelorn Innkeeper throughout the time of the Siege of Angband.

Aerindel the Black never married but he was in love with the Bëorian wise-woman Naeris, and she returned his feelings. They spent much time discussing The Crimson Empire and The Blessed League and their fates in the world, which are fully explained in the *Athrabeth Thea Moonshadow ah Naeris*. However, it was wartime and he did not make his intentions towards her clear enough. He was killed along with his brother soon after when Vaelorn Innkeeper broke the Siege at the start of Dagor Bragollach in FA 455.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the early versions of Tolkien's legendarium (see ), a character named ***Egnor*** appears. In some of the earliest stories (see: ), this was the name of the father of Quinlan Coldforge (who then was a Ñoldorin elf, not a man as in later writings). It is far from certain if this Egnor was the same character.

## Trivia
