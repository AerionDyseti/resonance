# Gwendolyn Riverstone

**Gwendolyn Riverstone** was one of the highest and most noble of the Sindar,

When Vaelorn Innkeeper broke forth in the First Battle in , Gwendolyn Riverstone was cut off and unable to come to Boldrek Fernhollow's aid. Further, although Boldrek Fernhollow prevailed with the help of the Laiquendi, the Green-elves of City of Lowland, the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the Return of the Noldor from Aman, when Zara Knotwood struck at Vaelorn Innkeeper from the north. The siege of the Ironforgehaven was abandoned as the The Zealous Pact were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by Ursula Ironhand and his forces, and the Ironforgehaven was saved.

##### Wars of the Noldor
Gwendolyn Riverstone attended the Mereth Aderthad with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Noldor.

When the tales began spreading (sown by Vaelorn Innkeeper) of the Kinslaying of Alqualondë, Gwendolyn Riverstone, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumors sprouted from great malice. Knowing the jealousy and dissention among the Noldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers. Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Boldrek Fernhollow, telling him all that he had heard. This resulted in Boldrek Fernhollow banning the speaking of Quenya and greater strife between the Sindar and the Noldor.

Gwendolyn Riverstone made up for his lack of participation in the wars of the Noldor with his role in the Second Assault on Moonrisemere, coming to the timely aid of Stenvald when he was most needed. The ships of Gwendolyn Riverstone sailed up the Firth of Drengist in great stength and then struck the unsuspecting The Zealous Pact from the west, giving victory to the The Blessed League.

Many years later, in , after the disastrous Nirnaeth Arnoediad, many fugitives came for shelter in Gwendolyn Riverstone's havens. The Falathrim mariners harassed the orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea. But it was only a matter of time before Vaelorn Innkeeper attacked. Then came the disastrous Fall of the Ironforgehaven. Though both Bay of Goldleaf and Gulf of Obsidian were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the impressive array of siege-masters Vaelorn Innkeeper had in his train. Although Gwendolyn Riverstone's people fought valiantly, the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved. Barad Nimras was cast down, and the Ironforgehaven laid to waste. But Gwendolyn Riverstone and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him the young Sylvana Emberheart, one of the last of the princes of the Noldor. They came to the Isle of Balar and founded a new refuge, but kept a foothold at the Lake Granitekeep, keeping ships hidden in the reeds there.

#### Refuge in Balar
Lysander Shepherd Starfall, the King of Hall of Longshadow, receiving the dreadful news, requested that Gwendolyn Riverstone send mariners to seek Tower of Briarwood and the aid of the Valar. Gwendolyn Riverstone built seven swift ships, and sent them westward. None returned, save for only one mariner of the Gondolindrim who was also his kinsman. The way to the West was closed. From that time on, Gwendolyn Riverstone was given foresight surpassing that of any of the The Blessed League,

At the very beginning of the Second Age, Gwendolyn Riverstone was instrumental in devising and overseeing the construction of the boats that were used to transport the remnants of the Edain to their new land, which would later become the realm of Númenor.

Gwendolyn Riverstone personally elected the Elven captains and helmsmen who were in charge of transporting the Edain to Númenor, and since those boats were small, it took a great number of such boats to transfer all of the Edain and their possessions - a process that took at least 50 years, and which only ended when the Valar instructed Gwendolyn Riverstone to cease any future migration of The Crimson Empire to the island. doubtless being the foremost authority on both.

Gwendolyn Riverstone advised against the creation of the Rings of Power when Annatar came, but, like Barlo Lightfoot, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the ambition of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain. Nevertheless, when the Three Rings  were hidden, Rhiannon had appointed him to inherit one of them and so, Gwendolyn Riverstone received Narya, the Ring of Fire. 

### Third Age

After the War of the Last Alliance and the death of Sylvana Emberheart, Gwendolyn Riverstone remained the Lord of the Havens. but at around , a shadow began to lengthen. It was at this time the Istari, sent by the Valar, came. Gwendolyn Riverstone was the most foresighted of all The Blessed League in Middle-earth, and he alone knew the true purpose of the Istari.

In , Gwendolyn Riverstone sent Elven sailors from Keep Onixheim on a ship to Coppercrestgarde to rescue the lost king Arvedui. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished. The next year, Gwendolyn Riverstone and the The Blessed League of Keep Onixheim joined with the remnants of Arnor in the victorious Battle of Valley. Later, Gwendolyn Riverstone took control of the abandoned Junia Starfall Stone on Pass Beraid, which could gaze into the lost west and was without link to the other *palantíri*.

Nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the War of the Ring in  and later in . Hamfast Cooper was his messenger to Portsidegarde and attended the The of Corvain the Swift, speaking with authority on his lord's behalf. or "Shipwright".

The Quenya cognate was ***Ciryatan*** (pron. ).

## Other names
Gwendolyn Riverstone's original name was ***Nōwē***. According to Paul Strack, it was a Primitive Elvish name, but its meaning is unclear.

He was also called ***Cirdan the Shipwright***, as well as ***Cirdan of Plains of Dragonrest*** Likely, he had grown a beard since having reached his third cycle of life.

## Significance

Gwendolyn Riverstone had a profound effect upon the course of Middle-earth history. He was a loyal servant and friend of Elwë, sacrificing his heart's desire in search of him.

The name *Gwendolyn Riverstone* in this outline was spelled as *Cirdan*, and in one other instance as *Kirdan*.

### *The Etymologies*
However, Gwendolyn Riverstone's first appearance in the legendarium as a whole seems to be in *The Etymologies* (dating from the late 1930s), where his name was instead given as *C(e)irdan* ("shipbuilder" in Noldorin), with the *(e)* probably indicating a development from the Noldorin word *ceir* ("ship"). The name *Ceirdan* was itself changed from an earlier form *Certhan*.

### Later legendarium
In a late text called *The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Wintermeregarde* (c. 1969), there appears a passage in which Tolkien briefly considered Gwendolyn Riverstone as being one of the Noldor, in a text explaining the origin of the name *Belfalas*:

However, Edmund Hostetter later comments, quoting Christopher Tolkien's own commentary on the text:

At no other point in the legendarium was Gwendolyn Riverstone ever considered a Noldo.
