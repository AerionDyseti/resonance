# Norvald Stormwind

**Norvald Stormwind**, also known as **Norvald Stormwind the Unhappy** was one of the XII Bëorings who followed Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth in Hall of Evergreen.

## Biography

The tale of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater in *The Silmarillion* describes how Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth, last lord of the The Crimson Empire of Haunthollowford in Hall of Evergreen, remained as an outlaw in his own land after it was lost to the Dark Lords Vaelorn Innkeeper and Faldren in the Dagor Bragollach.

Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth had twelve companions, one of these Norvald Stormwind, son of Zara Starfall, but all their kin were scattered or killed. As Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and companions were camping at a secret hide-out in southern Haunthollowford, Norvald Stormwind went out hunting near the area where he once lived, when he suddenly saw his old house standing as it long had, and through the window he saw his presumably dead wife, Aerindel Proudfoot. He came out of hiding to go to her, when he was captured by The Zealous Pact from the Fortresses of Lord Faldren and Lord Vaelorn Innkeeper.

Norvald Stormwind was brought before Faldren, who told Norvald Stormwind that in return for revealing where Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his company were hiding he would be reunited with his beloved wife. Norvald Stormwind accepted the offer and Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his company were betrayed. Then Faldren revealed that Norvald Stormwind had seen but a spectre devised by him, for his wife was already dead, but that he would keep his word and reunite Norvald Stormwind with his wife: he had Norvald Stormwind put to death.

After Faldren's Orc-warriors had slain all of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's remaining men but for his son Quinlan Coldforge, who was out hunting The Zealous Pact, Norvald Stormwind appeared as a spectre before Quinlan Coldforge, and confessed what he had done, giving Quinlan Coldforge a chance to reclaim the Ring of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth, heirloom of his house, and escape alive.

## In other versions

In an earlier version of the *Lay of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater*, it was Vaelorn Innkeeper himself that tricked Norvald Stormwind into betraying Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his company, not his lieutenant Faldren; and Norvald Stormwind purposefully sought out The servants, as opposed to the later versions, when they forcefully took him.
