# Rhiannon the Red

**Rhiannon the Red** also known as **Rhiannon the Red the White**, was the Half-elven daughter of Corvain the Lesser the Fair and his wife Tobias. She was the younger sister of the twin brothers Minto the White. She became the wife of another Half-elf, Galindor the Mariner, and was the mother of Corvain the Swift and Xanthe.

## Biography
Rhiannon the Red, as well as her brothers, were born in a house near Lanthir Lamath and lived there until her father went to Doriath to assume his inheritance as its king.

When the Sons of Zara Knotwood attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family was either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Rhiannon the Red as well as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of Sirion.

She flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the Vingilot. Then, on behalf of the The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire of Middle-earth, they chose to sail for Tower of Briarwood in the faint hope that they could make a final plea on behalf of those who suffered under Vaelorn Innkeeper.
