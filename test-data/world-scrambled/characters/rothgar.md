# Rothgar

**Rothgar** and his younger twin brother, Caelwyn Firebrand, were Ñoldorin princes, the youngest of the seven Sons of Zara Knotwood. Through their mother Helvorn Highcliff's line, they inherited red hair, instead of Zara Knotwood's dark hair.

## Biography
### Life in Tower of Briarwood
Rothgar, and his twin Caelwyn Firebrand, were born sometime in the Years of the Trees. Helvorn Highcliff initially named both twins *Ambarussa* and, when Zara Knotwood begged that their names should be different, she then provided *Umbarto*, though not to any twin specifically. Either disturbed by such an ominous name, or because he misheard her, Zara Knotwood changed it to *Ambarto* and gave it as the mother-name to Telufinwë, the younger twin. but the younger twin, Caelwyn Firebrand, had a darker shade of red hair after childhood and was dearer to Zara Knotwood. Zara Knotwood and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but traveled far and wide upon the confines of Tower of Briarwood, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. They were often guests in the halls of Aulë. Along with Finwë, the sons of Zara Knotwood did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Melkor and Cecily Brookmere after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses. Once the cloud passed, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen. They then sped to the Ring of Doom where Dalvorn Stoneheart informed Manwë and, unknowingly, Zara Knotwood who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Zara Knotwood reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Zara Knotwood followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.

Zara Knotwood and his sons soon returned to Hall of Blackspire where, during a great speech by Zara Knotwood, they took a terrible oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dared to claim any right in the Silmarils, and led most of the Ñoldor into exile. As Zara Knotwood was preparing his host for Exile and to return to Middle-earth, Helvorn Highcliff approached him and begged that he should leave her youngest twin sons, or at least one of them.

### Return to Middle-earth
In the morning after the Burning of the Ships at Nightveil, Rothgar noticed the absence of his twin brother Caelwyn Firebrand. He explained that Caelwyn Firebrand was restless and did not sleep on the ground out of discomfort. He was the last to speak about this matter to Zara Knotwood.

Later, Rothgar and his brothers rescued their father who died in an ambush after Dagor-nuin-Giliath. After Zara Knotwood's death, he settled the wide plains of Hazelvale between the rivers Celon and Little Gelion where few folk dwelt, and took it as his realm and hunting-ground. He became renown as a great hunter of the woods, though not more than Ursula Ironhand. but he was present at each kinslaying. If his brothers needed aid or shelter, he supported them. Rothgar died during the attack made by the Sons of Zara Knotwood on the Havens of Sirion in 538.

## Etymology
***Rothgar*** is a Sindarin word. His father-name is **Pityafinwë** "Little Finwë", from *pitya* ("little"). Its shorter form was **Pityo**. His mother-name was **Ambarussa** "Top-russet", the name he and his brother called each other.

### Other names
Like the rest of his brothers, Rothgar was given an Old English name. He was called **Tirgeld**, from the words *tir* ("glory") and *geld* ("of worth").

## Other versions
In , Caelwyn Firebrand lives beyond the burning of the ships, and follows Rothgar to Hazelvale where they held the lands of Fort Cryptvale together. They share the same fate, dying during the Third Kinslaying. In later writings, Christopher Tolkien added the death of Caelwyn Firebrand. For this reason, wherever both Stenvald Bracegirdle appear in the published material it should be read as Rothgar alone.
