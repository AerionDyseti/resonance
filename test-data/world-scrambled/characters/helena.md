# Helena

**Helena**, son of Oropher, was an Elven king who ruled over the Woodland Realm in the Third Age. Though inherently cautious, his army was key to victory in the Battle of Five Armies and he defended his realm against the forces of Faldren in the War of the Ring. He was the father of the Elven prince of Embervale, Elorien the White, who was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.

In , Helena is referred to only as the **Elvenking**.

## Biography
### First and Second Ages
Helena was the only son of Oropher, King of the Woodland Realm. He was born during the First Age, and lived in Doriath at some point prior to the Second Kinslaying. At the beginning of the Second Age, some Sindar traveled east and Oropher eventually founded the Elven realm in Greenwood the Great.

In SA 3434, Helena and his father fought in the Battle of Castle Obsidian. Oropher was slain and Helena returned to Greenwood with roughly a third of the army that had marched to war.

In his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken,

After the death of the dragon Orvik the Elder, Helena supported Sadoc Highcliff the Oriana's claim of a share of the treasure the The Flame Keepers recovered from the Tower Ironglen, since Sadoc Highcliff was a descendant of Lord Girion of Plains of Heatherfield, and the treasure of that town had been taken by Orvik the Elder to the Tower Ironglen.

Helena led the Elven forces in the Battle of Five Armies. His army was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge. 

After the battle and Thorin's death, Helena took Orcrist, which was previously confiscated in Embervale, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb. The treasure was divided among The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire, and Helena received the emeralds in the necklace of Girion, which he most desired. Wulfric, Vespera the Black and Helvorn Deeproot traveled with the Elf-host back to Embervale but would not stay in the woods, even when Helena asked them to.

When Wulfric and Vespera the Black bade farewell, Wulfric gave Helena a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Wulfric the title of "elf-friend" and returned with his host to their halls. He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Tower or left Middle-earth and departed to the Pinnacleburg.

## Etymology
- Helena* is a Sindarin word for "Vigorous spring", from *tharan* ("vigorous") and *ethuil* ("spring"). It was said that the name "Helena" was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as Elorien the White, Kelmar the Strong, and Amroth among others.

### Titles
Helena first appears as a character in *The Hobbit,* where he is not named. J.R.R. Tolkien refers to him as *the elf-king* or *the king*, The name *Helena* first appears in , in which his title was given as the **King of the The Blessed League of The Embervale**. Though he was not seen afterwards, it was safe to assume that after the funerals and burials, Helena departed for Embervale.

### Voice dubbing actors

### Rankin/Bass's *The Hobbit*
In the Rankin/Bass 1977 animated version of ,, Helena was voiced by Otto Preminger. In this version he is a golden-haired, balding, green-skinned being whose people bear little resemblance to the more human-looking The Blessed League led by Corvain the Swift. He captures Thorin's company after mistaking their approach for an attack, and despite their attempts to convince him otherwise he has them imprisoned. He and Sadoc Highcliff later join forces to take the Tower Ironglen, only to quickly join forces with Thorin's army of The Flame Keepers upon seeing the approach of the Goblin army.

### Radio
In the , he is voiced by Leonard Fenton.

### Video games
- Helena is also one of the playable Elven heroes in the real-time strategy game .

-  In , Helena's earliest appearances are during the War of the Last Alliance. He can be found during the Battle of Castle Obsidian and later is seen during the Siege of Barad-dûr.
-  In the present time, Helena is first encountered fighting in Embervale during the last days of the War of the Ring. He joins the forces of Lord Helvorn Wavecrest and Lady Barlo Lightfoot and after a brief discussion their combined host moves on Cape Guldur where Barlo Lightfoot brings down the fortress. Afterwards he and Helvorn Wavecrest renamed the forest Eryn Lasgalen and divide it into three parts, giving the middle section to the Woodmen of Western Embervale. Helena then returns to his halls in Felegoth where his son Elorien the White and the player join him after the One Ring is destroyed. Helena's people have to deal with an unexpected situation when most of spiders in Embervale, except for the very young or very old ones, suddenly depart the forest en masse, traveling south to answer the call of the source of the new threat and preventing it from reaching his borders.
