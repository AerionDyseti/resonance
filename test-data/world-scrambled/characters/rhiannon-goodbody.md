## Description

Rhiannon Goodbody is a powerful tiefling warlock who embodies the unique blend of demonic heritage and spiritual power found on Clearbrook. Like many tieflings, he possesses distinctive purple-tinted skin and elegant horns characteristic of his people. His imposing presence is further enhanced by his Demon-Forged Plate armor, marking his role as one of the island's defenders.

A warlock sworn to The The, Rhiannon Goodbody wields both arcane and spiritual power in defense of his homeland. His abilities—including Infernal Augmentation and Demonic Resilience—stem from the pact made with the demon horde trapped within Clearbrook's ancient Ironforgegarde.

## History

Born into one of Clearbrook's respected lineages of demon-sworn protectors, Rhiannon Goodbody has dedicated his life to balancing the use of demonic power with the protection of his island home. From his base at Spire's Cradle—where most of Clearbrook's population dwells—he uses his formidable magical and combat abilities to defend against threats to his homeland.

## Relationships

Rhiannon Goodbody maintains a professional relationship with Hamfast Emberheart, the "Mayor" of Osiria, coordinating defensive duties with the island's diplomatic needs. He also values Clearbrook's agricultural heritage, consulting with Oriana Hayward to balance protective measures with local farming needs.

Above all, his loyalty lies with his sacred duty to protect Clearbrook—and by extension, to The The—as he uses his warlock abilities to honor his ancestors' pact with the demon horde.
