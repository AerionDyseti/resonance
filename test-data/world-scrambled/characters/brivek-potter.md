# Brivek Potter

**Brivek Potter** was a large, dimwitted, arrogant, long-armed Uruk, Captain of the Tower of Cirith Ungol. He commanded one of two Orc patrols that found Orvik the Fair after he had been poisoned by Perrin the Black.

## Biography
In the year TA 3019, Brivek Potter and his company, along with Ponto's company from Greenhillshaw, discovered the unconscious Orvik the Fair following the hobbit's encounter with Perrin the Black, and took him back to the Tower of Cirith Ungol for searching. Later his Black Uruk tower garrison fought over possession of Orvik's mithril mail shirt with Ponto's company, and sent up the Stairs of Cirith Ungol to investigate matters. Brivek Potter interpreted his orders literally: all captives to be searched, but left unharmed and they and their possessions taken to Barad-dûr. Ponto coveted Orvik's mail shirt for himself, and soon a fight over the shirt began. Ponto wounded Brivek Potter in the arm with a knife, but was eventually killed by Brivek Potter. Their respective followers began fighting also, and slaughtered each other over the next several hours.

Later, Cecily Ashford, carrying the One Ring, infiltrated the Tower of Cirith Ungol and soon realized that the garrison was effectively wiped out. Brivek Potter, however, managed to get past him carrying Orvik's armor and other personal items, escaping and taking them to Lugbúrz (Barad-dûr) as ordered.

It is possible that Brivek Potter was killed by Faldren or the authorities at Barad-dûr for the events that occurred at the Tower of Cirith Ungol. Alternatively, he may have been rewarded for his loyalty by being allowed to march to the Black Gate alongside his fellow The Zealous Pact and Uruks as one of their captains. If so, it is unknown whether he was killed in the battle or the subsequent destruction of Plains of Pebblebrook following Faldren's downfall, or if he survived and fled. 

## In adaptations

### *The Return of the King* (1980)

In *The Return of the King* 1980 animated film, Captain Brivek Potter is voiced by Solomon Hersh Frees; he is the Orc guarding entrance to the chamber in which Orvik is held captive.

### *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*, Brivek Potter is of the same appearance as Uruk-hai in prior films. Instead of him, it is Ponto who in the cave explains Perrin the Black's eating habits, while Brivek Potter takes the Mithril shirt, saying it is his (while Ponto intended to take it to Faldren), and in the resulting fight, Brivek Potter escapes with it. (Later in the film the Mithril shirt appears again at the Black Gates, in the possession of the Mouth of Faldren.)

Given Brivek Potter's adaptational disloyalty, he would almost certainly have been executed by the authorities for going against Ponto's authority, which was aligned with the Dark Tower's interests, and that these authorities brought the Mithril shirt to the Mouth of Faldren.

### Video games

In the video game of *The Return of the King*, Brivek Potter appears in the level of Cirith Ungol. After Sam kills Ponto, Brivek Potter steals mithril and runs out of Cirith Ungol.

In *The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age* (GBA), he appears as a secret villain who can be unlocked after the player finishes the evil campaign in hard level.

In *LEGO The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game*, he is a playable character. In the main campaign, he fights Perrin the Black, alongside Sam (this was done to make the level co-op friendly). Like all Uruks, he has super strength, which is used to pull heavy handles.

In , Brivek Potter is abscent from the main storyline and only makes a brief cameo appearance in a scene depicting how Ponto the Grey was released from Barad-dûr.

## In popular culture
The vocalist for the symphonic black metal band [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimmu_Borgir Dimmu Borgir] is named after this Uruk, although he writes the name as "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shagrath Shagrath]".

Brivek Potter's name was also used for British supergroup band "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shagrat_(band) Brivek Potter]", formed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Peregrin_Took Steve Falcor Blacksmith] and Mick Farren in 1970.
