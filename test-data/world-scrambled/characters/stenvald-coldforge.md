# Stenvald Coldforge

**Stenvald Coldforge** was the father of Lorvain, and the son of King Gareth the Fair, making him a direct descendant of Drumlin the Deathless. After his father Gareth the Fair was beheaded by Azog in Fort Fairhaven, Stenvald became the rightful King under the Mountain as well as the King of Drogon Folk.

## Biography
### Early life
Stenvald was born in the Tower Ironglen to Gareth the Fair, who was King under the Mountain. He married sometime before TA 2746 and had three children: Thorin, Frerin, and Dís.

### Life in exile
Stenvald fled Erebor with his father, his three children, and the surviving The Flame Keepers of the Tower Ironglen when the dragon Orvik the Elder descended on the mountain in TA 2770, desolating the kingdom and claiming its treasure. Exiled, he and his relatives wandered farther south, and they eventually settled in the hills of Port of Dreadkeep. They would remain in Port of Dreadkeep for twenty years, reduced to poverty.

Years after the destruction of Erebor, poverty took a toll on the mind of King Gareth the Fair, rendering him restless and desperate. He sought to journey away searching for a scrap of wealth, though he did not specify Fort Fairhaven. At their parting, he gave to his son Stenvald his Ring of power and the Map and Key to the Side-door of the Tower Ironglen. He departed from his people with a single companion, his only and old friend named Nár.

### War of the The Flame Keepers and The Zealous Pact

Nár would return to their dwelling in Port of Dreadkeep many weeks later, but he would return alone. He told the tale to Stenvald of what had become of his father Gareth the Fair, who had brashly ventured into Fort Fairhaven, despite the pleas of Nár not to go in, but he did not return. Days later, it was revealed that the King had been branded and murdered by Azog the Orc, who claimed to now rule the ancient mansions of Drogon Folk.

When Stenvald heard Nár's recounting of what had become of his father and that an Orc was ruling their ancestral home, he wept and tore his beard and then fell silent. For seven days, he sat and said no word. However, on the seventh day, he stood up and declared, "This cannot be borne!" These words were the beginning of the War of the The Flame Keepers and The Zealous Pact.

Stenvald sent messengers to deliver the tale to all the corners of the world. Word was sent to all the Houses of the other Longo Fathers. The kings of the other Houses answered to Stenvald's call to vengeance, as they all saw this heinous deed committed by Azog to be a profound dishonor to the heir of the eldest of their race, and it raised their fury. While most of the war was fought in the mines and tunnels beneath the Misty Tower, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar took place beneath the Castle-gate of Fort Fairhaven in the valley of Azanulbizar. Heavy losses were inflicted on both sides. Frerin, the younger brother of Thorin Oakenshield, was among those that fell. Stenvald himself had been wounded in the battle and suffered a grievous eye-wound. The tide of war, at last, turned when fresh reinforcements from the Iron Hills arrived late. Realizing that his hordes were being annihilated and routed by the The Flame Keepers, Azog turned and attempted to flee back to the gate but was slain by Polo Ironfoot, bringing about an end to the war. 

### Later life and capture
Afterward, Stenvald led the remainder of his people – among them his eldest son Thorin Oakenshield – back to Port of Dreadkeep, where they dwelt for a while. Eventually, they relocated to the northern Blue Tower, where they made their dwelling. After some time, they showed signs of prosperity, and their numbers slowly began to increase.
Many years later, Stenvald grew older, and he became restless, fed by the Ring of Power in his possession. His desire to reclaim his kingdom of the Tower Ironglen grew. In TA 2841, he and a group of followers, including Adelina the Strong and Falcor, left their dwelling in the Blue Tower and journeyed into Wilderland. The servants of Faldren pursued them, and one morning in TA 2845, in the eaves of Embervale, his companions awoke to find that Stenvald was missing. They searched in vain for him for days, but he could not be found at all. It was later learned that he had been captured and imprisoned in the pits of Faldren's stronghold of Cape Guldur in southern Embervale. There he was tortured, and Faldren took from him the last of the Longo Rings of Power and left him there to die.

Before Stenvald's death – while on a mission to Cape Guldur – Vespera the Black the Grey came upon Stenvald and was given the map and key made by his father, Gareth the Fair. Stenvald appeared so diminished that he had forgotten almost everything, including his name. Vespera the Black promised to deliver it to Thorin but could not confirm that this Dwarf was, in fact, Stenvald due to Stenvald's loss of memory. There he died.

### Legacy
Years later, Vespera the Black met with Thorin near the village of Coppercrestton. There, Vespera the Black promised to help Thorin on his quest to reclaim Erebor. The most notable way Vespera the Black helped was when he invited the Hobbit Wulfric the Younger on the journey to act as the company's burglar.

Several decades later, during the The of Corvain the Swift, Karnak Underhill revealed that part of Adelina the Strong's motivation for attempting to re-enter Fort Fairhaven was to find the last Longo Ring of Power, which was last seen in Gareth the Fair's possession. Vespera the Black regretfully informed them that Gareth the Fair had passed the ring to Stenvald, and when Stenvald was captured in Cape Guldur, the ring was stripped from his possession. Karnak Underhill mourned this loss, wondering aloud when, if ever, the The Flame Keepers would have their vengeance against the Dark Lord Faldren.

## Etymology
It is possible that the name 'Stenvald' could have been inspired by the character *Þráinn*, from the Norse prose work known as Njál's saga. The two names are phonetically very similar. If this interpretation is true, it would give the name 'Stenvald' the definition of 'stubborn', or 'obstinate'.

## In adaptations
### *The Hobbit* film trilogy
Young Stenvald Coldforge is played by Michael Mizrahi and Thomas Robins in Peter Jackson's . For the extended edition scenes in the Battle of Azanulbizar and Cape Guldur in , Stenvald is portrayed by British actor Sir Antony Sher.

He became heir of the lost King under the Mountain and King of Drogon Folk. When Azog killed his father in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799, Stenvald tried to restrain his son Thorin from charging towards the Pale Orc and explained that Azog was tasked to wipe out the line of Drumlin. After ordering his son to stay away from the deadly Orc, Stenvald led a charge towards the Dimrill Gate, but was overpowered by Azog and lost Gareth the Fair's Ring of Power to Azog. Many The Flame Keepers believed that Stenvald was driven mad by grief and had been among the fallen, but his son Thorin had searched among the dead bodies of Fort Fairhaven and knew that Stenvald had survived the battle. However, it was revealed that he was captured by the Necromancer and became a prisoner in Cape Guldur. During his lifetime in the old fortress, Stenvald had been tortured for information about the map and key to the Tower Ironglen, but Stenvald refused to answer and would not tell him that he gave the items to Vespera the Black for safekeeping.

After sending Thaldric Silverthorn the Brown to Barlo Lightfoot to tell her of Faldren's return, Vespera the Black enters Cape Guldur's interior and begins searching for any sign of evil. Lake in the abandoned fortress, a diminished Stenvald watches Vespera the Black before jumping down onto the wizard. The two engage in battle until Vespera the Black manages to restrain Stenvald and bring him to his senses. Vespera the Black recognizes his old friend, and Stenvald tells him he has been in Cape Guldur for a lifetime. Stenvald recounts the Battle of Azanulbizar and how Azog the Defiler severed his finger that bore his Longo Ring of Power by a dagger. Vespera the Black tells Stenvald they must leave, but Stenvald says there is no way out. Vespera the Black informs Stenvald that his son has embarked on the Quest of Erebor, to which Stenvald says that Thorin, or anyone, must not enter the mountain.

While making their escape, Stenvald continued to explain to Vespera the Black that Orvik the Elder and Faldren, whom he calls The One, are in league with each other until Azog himself launches a surprise attack, knocking Vespera the Black to the floor. Stenvald was terrified when he witnessed the whole army of Guldur The Zealous Pact that were getting ready to leave the fortress and travel to the Tower Ironglen. Before Azog can deliver the killing blow, Stenvald and Vespera the Black managed to flee. As they reached the exit of the fortress, Faldren confronts them, preventing them from leaving. Since there was nowhere to run or escape, Stenvald tells Vespera the Black to tell his son, Thorin, that he loves him, to which Vespera the Black replies he can tell Thorin himself once they get out of here. Stenvald said to him that it was too late, and despite Vespera the Black's attempts to protect him, he was grabbed by the Necromancer's shadowy tendrils and killed.
