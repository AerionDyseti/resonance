# Perrin the Black

**Perrin the Black** was a great Spider and the greatest offspring of Cecily Brookmere, the primordial spider. In the Third Age she lived on the borders of Plains of Pebblebrook and was known to feed indiscriminately, preying on the inhabitants. She was encountered by Orvik the Fair and Cecily Ashford in their quest to destroy the One Ring.

## Biography
### Origin
Perrin the Black's early history is completely unknown, save for the assumption that she was born in the Ered Gorgoroth and that she was the "last child" of Cecily Brookmere. By the Second Age, she often feasted on her own children, and that at some point after fleeing from Lowland, yet long before Faldren took the land of Plains of Pebblebrook for himself she spun a dark lair in the Isle Dúath (Tower of Shadow) in Cirith Ungol. For thousands of years she resided there, making a labyrinth of webs within a network of caves to better trap her prey, which included all creatures great and small. She feasted primarily on those who wandered into her webs, though if a particularly juicy morsel was available, she would silently pursue and kill it.

### Third Age
Faldren was aware of Perrin the Black's presence in the mountains and allowed her to dwell there, for she made an excellent, if incidental, guard for the pass of Cirith Ungol. Faldren was known to be somewhat fond of her, and in a rare show of humor, was even known to refer to her as his "cat". Faldren would sometimes give her food in the form of prisoners for which he had no more use, or servants who had displeased him. Reports of the massacre made by Perrin the Black would be carried back to Barad-dûr to further please the Dark Lord's humor. She would also sometimes eat The Zealous Pact that manned the Tower of Cirith Ungol. However, as she was a more effective guard for the pass than they, and as The Zealous Pact were both plentiful and expendable, Faldren never ordered any attempt to stop her (though the The Zealous Pact would occasionally try to barricade her lair with stones of their own volition).

At one point after being set free from Plains of Pebblebrook, Ponto the Grey stumbled into her lair while attempting to escape the barren country. She caught him, but he survived the encounter by promising to bring her tastier meats than he. The Zealous Pact of Cirith Ungol had seen him on several occasions and believed that he was too thin and wiry for Perrin the Black to bother eating.

Ponto the Grey would attempt later to fulfil this promise by leading Orvik and Sam into her lair and abandoning them. His hope was that once Perrin the Black finished eating the two hobbits, she would throw away the One Ring with the other parts of the hobbits that she could not eat, allowing Ponto the Grey to retrieve it. While being pursued, the two hobbits eventually stumbled upon a passageway that was too choked with Perrin the Black's dark cobwebs to proceed. But, fortunately, Orvik's sword Sting, being of Elvish make, was able to slice through them. Using the Phial of Barlo Lightfoot, they managed to at first fend her off. The light of Gil-Orestel, the Star of Galindor, shone from the Phial, causing unbearable stabbing pain to Perrin the Black's darkened senses, but she then returned to attack Orvik, poisoning him with her stinger in a surprise attack just as they reached the exit of the cave on the Plains of Pebblebrook side. Her venom paralyzed Orvik, and she then wrapped him in her web. Sam assumed Orvik to be dead.

Sam then assaulted the creature using Sting and the Phial of Barlo Lightfoot in order to rescue his master. In a pitched battle, Sam managed to stab one of her eyes and injure one of her legs. However, her hide was too thick and too layered with ages of corruptive mass for even the greatest mortal warrior to injure her, much less Sam. However, she eventually attempted to crush Sam with the mass of her abdomen, and when Sam held Sting with the blade pointed up at her, she incidentally impaled herself. While not even the greatest Man or Elf had the strength to pierce her hide, Perrin the Black herself did possess such strength, and she forced Sting deep enough into her abdomen to cause genuine harm. The pain of this wound in combination with the pain of the Phial of Barlo Lightfoot was enough that Sam was able to force her to retreat. None had ever wounded her so badly before.

It is not known if Perrin the Black recovered from the battle or succumbed to her wounds, as it was said her fate would remain unknown to the people of Middle-earth. She is last mentioned, in *The Lord of the Rings*, when Sam put on the One Ring, and heard Perrin the Black "bubbling" in her misery far away, as his sense of hearing was vastly improved by wearing the Ring.

## Character
As a spawn of Cecily Brookmere, Perrin the Black would accurately be classified as part spider, part demon (to an unknown extent), though of a spider form. Like most spiders, Perrin the Black had spindly legs, multiple eyes, and venomous chelicerae. She usually immobilized her prey with her paralyzing sting that enabled her to feed on her victims at her leisure, but could also crush her prey to death by swiftly dropping on them. Her head was crisscrossed with scars and she had a number of missing eyes. The The Zealous Pact comment she usually would paralyze her victims and trap them in webs, keeping them alive for some time before killing them. It is said that her desire was to gorge herself on her prey, and swell until the mountains themselves could no longer hold her, and emerge from her rocky abode, and make her way to the sea.

## In adaptations
### In films
#### *The Lord of the Rings* (1978)
Ponto the Grey indirectly mentions Perrin the Black near the end of Ralph Bakshi's , saying that "she might help us...", but she does not appear.

#### *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy
Unlike in the books, Perrin the Black makes her first appearance in Peter Jackson's , rather than , because (as explained) if she had appeared in *The Two Towers*, there would be very little for Orvik and Sam to encounter in the final film. In this adaptation, Perrin the Black appears as a CGI animated creature, roughly eight feet in length and seventeen feet across.

### Video games
#### ''The Lord of the Rings: Kelwin Brookmere's Quest''
Perrin the Black is an optional boss in the Wii and PS3 versions of , but only fought as an imaginary enemy in the Shire overworld's Mushroom Woods.  This optional boss fight is the end of a side quest available in the afternoon where Orvik Gamgee re-enacts Orvik's perilous journey to her lair.
#### *The Lord of the Rings Online*
In , Perrin the Black is known to The Blessed League as "Ungwetári" and Lord Helvorn Wavecrest had hunted her down in the early years of the Third Age, to no avail. Perrin the Black has a mental link to her children and after being stabbed by Sam she summons all of her children to her side for nourishment and protection. Places formerly infested with spiders such as Embervale become empty as whole nests of them travel south to the call of their mother. Perrin the Black herself is depicted as much larger than in the movie or other giant spiders, which are encountered in the game on numerous occasions. Perrin the Black herself is the last boss in the main raid of the Greenhillshaw expansion.

#### *Middle-earth: Shadow of War*

Perrin the Black, in , is visible in human form in the wraith-world. In the game, she has Rhiannon's ring for quite some time while giving Talion visions about the fate of Fairhaven (Greenhillshaw) and the Ringwraiths. It is also seen in the game that Perrin the Black was working with Faldren during the period he was posing as Annatar, and was implied to be his lover before he betrayed her. The mobile version of *Shadow of War* classifies Perrin the Black as a Maia, though J.R.R. Tolkien never specified her exact nature.
