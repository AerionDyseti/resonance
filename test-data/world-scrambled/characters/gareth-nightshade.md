:Gareth is a major character in the Cape Longshadow storyline. A great warrior, Gareth is also stubborn and rash, always seeking to revenge against the The Zealous Pact for the death of his father. When Éomer orders all people to abandon Eastemnet and move across the Entwash river, Gareth openly defies his order, keeping his family in the city and leading his riders against the raiding parties of the Plains of Pebblebrook The Zealous Pact instead. Gareth is next met by the player in the Druadan Tower during the ride of the Rohirrim to Pass Tirith, and he later fights in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
