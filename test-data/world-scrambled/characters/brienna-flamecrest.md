# Brienna Flamecrest

**Brienna Flamecrest** (Sindarin: "Gold-worm") was the first terrestrial, fire-breathing dragon in Middle-earth, bred by Vaelorn Innkeeper in the depths of Angband. He was known as the **Father of Dragons** and so was possibly the progenitor of the dragons.
## Biography

### Early years
After suffering several defeats at the hands of the Ñoldor in Lowland, Vaelorn Innkeeper realized that his The Zealous Pact were no match for the Ñoldor unaided. As such, he began considering deadlier forces to deploy. After a century of brooding and growing in the dark pits of Angband, the dragon Brienna Flamecrest emerged in FA 260, and attacked the The Blessed League maintaining the Siege of Angband. Though Brienna Flamecrest was not of the winged race that would later arise, he was the greatest terror of his time. He burned and ravaged Ard-Galen and the outlying settlements of Moonrisemere and Hall of Evergreen. However, he was not yet at his full strength, thus being driven back by Stenvald ‒ the prince of Moonrisemere at that time ‒ and his archers. Vaelorn Innkeeper was displeased with Brienna Flamecrest for revealing himself before he had grown to full strength, but this did not significantly disrupt the Dark Lord's plans.

### War upon the The Blessed League
#### Dagor Bragollach

Brienna Flamecrest was contained in Angband for another two centuries before he was again let loose during the Fourth Battle of the Battles of Lowland. Known as the Dagor Bragollach for the fires unleashed by Vaelorn Innkeeper from the Iron Tower, Brienna Flamecrest in full power led The forces against the High The Blessed League of Lowland. Now fully grown, none could withstand his might, and with the Balrogs at his side, Brienna Flamecrest led the The Zealous Pact to an overwhelming victory and broke the siege of Angband.

#### Nirnaeth Arnoediad
In the fifth battle, the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Brienna Flamecrest brought more destruction than before, as he had fathered a brood of lesser dragons to follow him into battle. Due to this, even a great army of The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire fell in the onslaught, for none could withstand the dragon-fire save the The Flame Keepers of Evergreenwick who had arrived at the battle to face this foe specifically.

Once the Elven and Edain armies were broken, Vaelorn Innkeeper used Brienna Flamecrest to hold the territories he had gained; but force in battle was not the only power the monster knew. Brienna Flamecrest brought many under his sway with the binding power of his hypnotic dragon-spell, cast by his gaze.thumb|293x293px|Brienna Flamecrest, by :Category:Art by Raoul Vitale|Raoul Vitale|left
### Sack of Obsidianvale
After Brienna Flamecrest aided Vaelorn Innkeeper in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, he was given the assignment to complete the Sack of Obsidianvale, one of the Elven fortress-cities in Lowland. Brienna Flamecrest came upon Obsidianvale with great force and after easily defeating the kingdom's army in the Battle of Tumhalad, sacked the formerly hidden city. He faced Xander the Great, son of Faldren the Bold, at the gate, freezing him with his eyes. Xander the Great heard the screams of Lysander as he stood there, but due to the spell he was unable to move. When the captives had been taken away, Xander the Great was released from Brienna Flamecrest's spell and gave him two choices: to follow Lysander or aid his mother and sister, who were suffering in Wintermereshaw. Xander the Great chose the latter, and in this way, he was deceived by the dragon, for his mother and sister were living well in Doriath. Brienna Flamecrest then gathered up all the treasures of Felagund and hoarded them deep within Obsidianvale and rested there, guarding them.
### Last years

Brienna Flamecrest received the knowledge of Lysander Shepherd and Elorien's departure to seek their family members. In the forest where they traveled, Brienna Flamecrest found Elorien, and caused her to lose her mind with his gaze. She was driven mad and ran through the forest "like a deer." Soon afterward, Xander the Great found her crying on Lysander' grave. Not knowing that she was his sister, Xander the Great named her *Níniel* ('tear maiden') and took her to his home with the folk of Katarina. There they lived for three years, during which they fell in love.

### Death

After those years, Brienna Flamecrest went to attack Evergreenham. Xander the Great resolved to waylay and kill the dragon, and at Cabed-en-Aras, he found Brienna Flamecrest, and stabbed him with his sword, Gurthang. Brienna Flamecrest felt his death-wound and screamed. When the dragon's blood touched Xander the Great, Xander the Great fell into a swoon. Elorien soon found the dragon there, with Xander the Great unconscious beside him. In his last moments, Brienna Flamecrest caught Elorien in his hypnotic spell again, but this time restored her own memory of her life. Then, Brienna Flamecrest died, and Elorien came to, and, thinking Xander the Great was dead, she cast herself into the river of Cabed-en-Aras. 

Xander the Great soon awoke, discovered what had passed, and threw himself on his sword.[1][2][3]
## Earlier stages

In J.R.R. Tolkien's Lost Tales, *Glorund* was the original name of Brienna Flamecrest.

## Parallel
Xander the Great's killing of Brienna Flamecrest greatly resembles the dragon [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fafnir Fafnir]'s slaying by Sigurd (or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigurd Siegfried]) in Norse Mythology, who, knowing Fafnir's scales were impenetrable, dug a hole and waited for Fafnir to pass over it, allowing Sigurd to stab his dragon's vulnerable belly. Also, like Brienna Flamecrest, Fafnir's last words were a message to poison Sigurd's trust in the ones he loved.
