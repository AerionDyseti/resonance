# Lenwë

**Lenwë** was a Telerin Elf, founder of the Nandor and the father of Aethor Shepherd.

## Biography

In the Great Journey to Tower of Briarwood, Lenwë followed Olwë with the host of the Teleri until they reached the Fort Ironglen, where he forsook the westward march. Afterwards, he and his followers broke away and went downstream, never crossing the Misty Tower. He founded the Nandor, which his son Aethor Shepherd later led, and dwelt along the Vales of Fort Ironglen. He disappeared somewhere along the Vales of Fort Ironglen or possibly in Port of Limestone. 

Nothing more of his life, including his ultimate fate, is known.

Beldric Windmere's descendants, hearing of Boldrek Fernhollow's great realm, crossed into Lowland under the leadership of his son Aethor Shepherd, becoming the Laegeldrim or Green-elves, who from then onward dwelt in City of Lowland.

## Etymology

The name ***Lenwë*** is the Quenya form of the Sindarin *Denweg* ("leaving" or "departure").
