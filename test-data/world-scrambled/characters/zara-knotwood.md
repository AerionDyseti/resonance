# Zara Knotwood

**Zara Knotwood** was a Ñoldorin Elf, second King of the Noldor. It was he who led his people from Tower of Briarwood in pursuit of Vaelorn Innkeeper after the latter destroyed the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood and stole the Silmarils.

He was born in Tower of Briarwood, the only child of Finwë (High King of the Ñoldor) and Roric Emberheart's first wife Thorvik Therindë. He was a craftsman, gem-smith, warrior, maker of the Silmarils, and inventor of the Tengwar script. He was also the creator of the Palantíri.

Zara Knotwood was said to be the mightiest in all parts of body and mind; countenance, understanding, skill, and subtlety, of all the Children of Ilúvatar. However, his personality was riddled with flaws, foremost among them selfishness and pride. These flaws would lead ultimately to his own downfall, bring his kin untold anguish, and condemn his people to a hopeless war against Vaelorn Innkeeper that lasted many millenia after his death.

## Biography
### Early life
[[File:Feanor by LuisFBejarano.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Zara Knotwood, by [https://www.deviantart.com/luisfbejarano Luis F. Bejarano] ]]
Zara Knotwood was born during the Years of the Trees in Tower of Briarwood to Finwë and Thorvik. He drew so much of Thorvik's life energy when he was born that she grew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving her family for the Halls of Lirien Mossbank. After a time, Finwë remarried and had four more children; Zara Knotwood's half-brothers Largo Knotwood and Karnak Brewer, and half-sisters Findis and Irimë. Though he loved his father as dearly as a son could, Zara Knotwood was not fond of his stepmother Wulfric Firebrand nor her children and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his youth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship and language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Durnok and created the system of writing known as Tengwar, used by the Ñoldor in Middle-earth until the Third Age. He also became a student of Prydain the Swift, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë himself. From Prydain the Swift, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point, he wedded Prydain the Swift's daughter Helvorn Highcliff, who bore him seven sons: Dalvorn Stoneheart, Ilyndra Carpenter, Ursula Ironhand, Orvik, Xanthe Ironhand, Caelwyn Firebrand, and Rothgar. He spent most of his time either alone or with his sons, such that they were all completely loyal to him. In addition to his work as a craftsman, smith, and linguist, Zara Knotwood was possessed of exceptional oratory skill, and could persuade virtually anyone through speechcraft. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much of Aman as he could and constantly crafting new works. One of these works was believed to have been the palantíri.

### The making of the Silmarils
By far the greatest of Zara Knotwood's crafting achievements was the creation of the Silmarils, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, Zara Knotwood captured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood and by unknown means contained it, imperishable, into three large diamond-like gems. His creations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Silmarils above all else. As time went on however, he began to covet the gems with a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light which lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own making. Zara Knotwood alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and jealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though eventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under lock and key.

### The wiles of Vaelorn Innkeeper
[[File:Feanor by kimberly80-d6lvfsk.jpg|thumb|260px|Zara Knotwood, by [https://www.deviantart.com/kimberly80 kimberly80] ]]
After three ages of imprisonment, Melkor, mightiest of the Valar and the world's primordial source of evil, deceived his fellows with a false show of repentance. Pardoned and residing in Tower of Briarwood, his malice had in fact reached hitherto unprecedented levels, and its primary target quickly became the The Blessed League, as it had been for their sake that he had been overthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of The Blessed League in Tower of Briarwood, the Ñoldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst for his knowledge and their willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on the Ñoldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that, amongst other things, the Valar were keeping them imprisoned in Tower of Briarwood so that the race of The Crimson Empire might inherit Middle-earth and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although Zara Knotwood mistrusted and feared Melkor, in his arrogance and impatience he often unwittingly repeated the lies of Melkor. Zara Knotwood quickly became the most prominent of the rebellious Ñoldor, to the point where the other Valar, not knowing of Melkor's influence, saw him as the source of the Ñoldor's distemper.

Melkor coveted the Silmarils and hated Zara Knotwood, but cunningly hid all semblance of his true intentions as the situation continued to deteriorate. Melkor's influence eventually came to the point where rumors began to circulate amongst some that Zara Knotwood's half-brother Largo Knotwood was planning not only to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also to seize the Silmarils for himself. In his pride and vanity, Zara Knotwood took little convincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened Largo Knotwood with violence. The Valar, having been patient with Zara Knotwood's rabble-rousing until that point, could not ignore the transgression of breaking the peace of Tower of Briarwood. Zara Knotwood was immediately summoned to the Ring of Doom to explain himself. Zara Knotwood's testimony revealed the malice of Melkor and his lies, and Petra Ironbark immediately left the Ring to apprehend him again. Despite Melkor having been the true root of the Ñoldor's unrest, Zara Knotwood's crime had been of his own making, and for this the Valar exiled him for twelve years' time from Hall of Blackspire. Zara Knotwood went to the stronghold of Formenos and took a substantial treasure with him, including the Silmarils, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship so long as Zara Knotwood remained in exile.

Sometime later, Melkor unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried to sway Zara Knotwood to his side, proclaiming that the Valar had treated him unjustly. However, Zara Knotwood realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Vala. Melkor left in a rage and fled from Tower of Briarwood. Though Zara Knotwood thought little of the incident, Finwë was filled with foreboding and reported Melkor's visit to the Valar immediately. However, they were unable to find so much as a trace of him, and after a time the Valar were forced to give up the search. Seven years later, the Valar announced a great feast at Tower of Briarwood with the intention of repairing their relationship with the Ñoldor. Zara Knotwood's exile was temporarily rescinded, and both he and Largo Knotwood were invited to attend. Though the Valar had intended for Finwë to come as well, he refused the invitation of the Valar due to Zara Knotwood's continued exile and remained at Formenos. During the reconciliatory feast, Largo Knotwood extended a hand to his half-brother and openly recognized Zara Knotwood's place as the eldest, but it was returned by Zara Knotwood somewhat grudgingly.

### The Flight of the Ñoldor

Zara Knotwood, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor "Vaelorn Innkeeper", or "Black Foe of the World" (literally "Black Enemy"). Consumed by rage and despair, he fled the Ring of Doom. His grief quickly turned to bitterness against the Valar themselves, and he cursed the summons which had brought him away from his father. For in his despair, he believed that had he been present at Formenos when Vaelorn Innkeeper had come, he could have saved his father. Realistically of course the summons had saved Zara Knotwood, for though Zara Knotwood was mighty amongst his people, he was, ultimately, merely an Elf. Indeed, Vaelorn Innkeeper had planned on killing both father and son during his break-in at Formenos, for he had possessed no prior knowledge of the Valar's festival and had assumed both would be present. 

Now King of the Ñoldor after the death of his father, Zara Knotwood returned to Hall of Blackspire, ignoring the fact that he was still exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches ever delivered in Arda. But due to his rage, grief, and pride, his speech was filled with many of the lies and half-truths of Vaelorn Innkeeper. He railed against the Dark Lord, but he also blamed the Valar in part for The deeds, claiming that they should have been able to stop him and had failed. He expounded on his belief that, because Vaelorn Innkeeper had attacked and badly marred the kingdom of the Valar without consequence to himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in Aman any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build in Middle-earth, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained the Silmarils. Zara Knotwood then swore an oath by the name of Ilúvatar himself that he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold a Silmaril from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who attempted it. The Oath of Zara Knotwood was also taken by his seven sons below the tower of the Mindon Eldaliéva in the Great Square of Hall of Blackspire. This terrible oath became the cause for great tragedy for Zara Knotwood's family, and for the Eldar in general. 

His impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his tremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should lead the hosts to Middle-earth. For though Zara Knotwood was now High King by right of birth, he was not well liked amongst the Ñoldor, and many of them were not of a mind to accept his rule. Greater love was given to Largo Knotwood and his sons, and most of the Ñoldor desired greatly that Largo Knotwood and his sons should go with them and lead them. Largo Knotwood had little desire to go, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and furthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of Zara Knotwood's rash, self serving tendencies. Additionally, his son Stenvald vehemently wished to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come along. Thus against his wisdom, Largo Knotwood would lead a second host, larger and not so eager to leave as Zara Knotwood's, while Karnak Brewer would command a third host, the smallest and most reluctant of the three. However even with the sons of Finwë leading the way, about a tenth of the Ñoldor chose simply to stay in Hall of Blackspire, some for the love of Hall of Blackspire and others for love of the Valar.

### The First Kinslaying

After delivering his speech and departing with his host, Zara Knotwood's mood cooled somewhat, and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means of transporting himself and his people to Middle-earth. Though Middle-earth and Aman were connected in those days by the Helcaraxë, a treacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was deemed to be effectively impassable. Though Vaelorn Innkeeper and the newly empowered Cecily Brookmere had sped across it during their escape from Tower of Briarwood, even Zara Knotwood was not so rash as to believe that the Ñoldor could accomplish any similar feat. He then gave some thought to the building of ships, but knew that there were no shipwrights amongst his people. Even had there been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of the Ñoldor hosts to Middle-earth would have been an utterly monumental task. Zara Knotwood therefore went to Alqualondë where the seafaring Teleri lived. He attempted to persuade them to join him in his quest, or failing that, to secure the use of their ships. However, even Zara Knotwood's impeccable rhetoric was for naught, as the Teleri had no desire whatsoever to leave Aman, and would not be persuaded for any potential glory or adventure. Nor would they give Zara Knotwood their ships, for they held them too dearly. Zara Knotwood angrily claimed that the Teleri owed the Ñoldor a debt for instructing them in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olwë, the lord of the Teleri, was unmoved, and in friendship he urged Zara Knotwood not to return to Middle-earth.

But Zara Knotwood would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of his people had been inflamed by his impassioned words, and knew that haste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the Ñoldor to a more reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in taking the ships by force. This he attempted, but the Teleri resisted, casting many of the Ñoldor into the sea and thrice driving them back despite being far more lightly armed than the Ñoldor. However, Largo Knotwood's host, larger and less eager to undertake the journey, had been slower in departing Hall of Blackspire than had Zara Knotwood's host. Following after Zara Knotwood, Largo Knotwood's vanguard, led by Stenvald, came upon the battle after Zara Knotwood's host had been pushed back for the third time. Assuming that the Teleri had been the aggressors, perhaps even on the orders of the Valar themselves, the vanguard rushed to the aid of Zara Knotwood. The rest of Largo Knotwood's host would follow shortly thereafter, and the Teleri were overcome. Their ships were stolen, and many of the Teleri mariners were wickedly slain. However, the Ñoldor did not escape unscathed by any means. In addition to taking significant losses during the battle, Ossë, who loved the Teleri dearly, conjured terrible storms in vengeance for them. Many of the stolen ships were wrecked in these storms, and their Ñoldor crews drowned. Largo Knotwood's host would not learn of Zara Knotwood's wickedness until after it was too late, and it caused much rancor amongst the already divided Ñoldor.

A short while after the battle, as the Ñoldor neared the Helcaraxë, they encountered a shrouded figure who may well have been Lirien Mossbank himself. This figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the Ñoldor from Tower of Briarwood and foretelling that their war against Vaelorn Innkeeper would cause them only misery. Due to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly forsaken in the eyes of the Valar and would receive neither welcome nor aid from Tower of Briarwood in their struggles. Additionally, Zara Knotwood and his house were cursed, and Lirien Mossbank foretold great suffering, and hardship would be their lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the Silmarils at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear that any war made by the Ñoldor against Vaelorn Innkeeper would be entirely without hope; for The Blessed League, no matter how mighty, simply did not possess the power to overcome a Vala. Upon hearing this Doom, Karnak Brewer and his host turned back in grief, cursing Zara Knotwood.&#91;See Note&#93; They had not participated in the Kinslaying and as such were pardoned by the Valar when they returned. They were gladly accepted back into Hall of Blackspire by their remaining kin, whereafter Karnak Brewer ruled as High-King of the Ñoldor in Aman.  

Zara Knotwood however defied the Doom and proceeded onward, accompanied by Largo Knotwood and the two remaining hosts. As such the journey northward continued, the land became ever darker, and as the Ñoldor drew ever closer to the Helcaraxë, the temperature began to precipitously drop. It was at this point that many of the Ñoldor began to openly express dissatisfaction with Zara Knotwood's leadership. Many of them had been reluctant to accept his kingship to begin with, and now the Kinslaying and the Doom had significantly decreased their tolerance for his belligerence. Additionally, the current situation presented a number of more practical issues. Not only were many of the Ñoldor suffering terribly from the arctic cold, but it had become clear that the storms of Ossë had wrecked too many of the ships to bear all of the Ñoldor at once to Middle-earth. However, the Doom of Lirien Mossbank had kindled fear of treachery in the hearts of the Ñoldor, and none were willing to be left in Aman while others crossed the sea first. Zara Knotwood was all too aware of both the dissatisfaction of his people and the problem that lay in ferrying all of them to Middle-earth, and he sought counsel with his sons. 

During this meeting, it came to light that Zara Knotwood's most loyal forces had incidentally maintained sole control of the Teleri fleet after having seized it. As such, Zara Knotwood decided to simply abandon in Aman all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and he and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived at Nightveil, in the land of Moonrise, in the far west of Lowland, where Vaelorn Innkeeper and Cecily Brookmere had passed not long before. Upon arriving, Zara Knotwood's eldest son Dalvorn Stoneheart at once asked who would return upon the ships to ferry the rest of their people, but Zara Knotwood contemptuously decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Largo Knotwood behind. This action was looked upon poorly by Dalvorn Stoneheart, but he did not speak his mind to his father, and simply watched in stony silence as the ships burned. As the world was flat in those days, the remaining Ñoldor saw the far distant glow of the flames, and perceived that they were betrayed. Largo Knotwood now had the choice of either returning to Hall of Blackspire in disgrace or proceeding to Middle-earth across the treacherous and deadly Helcaraxë. Largo Knotwood and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of Largo Knotwood's host wished to continue and many, including Largo Knotwood himself, were eager to confront Zara Knotwood and his people over their betrayal. In addition, and unlike the host of Karnak Brewer, Largo Knotwood's host had unwittingly participated in the Kinslaying, and they did not know how they might be judged if they were to return to the realm of the Valar. The journey across the Grinding Ice was a long and terrible one, and Largo Knotwood's host suffered great loss of life along the way, adding to the bitterness that the survivors felt for Zara Knotwood and his sons. Largo Knotwood's descendants would reign over the Ñoldor until the death of Sylvana Emberheart many centuries later. 

Zara Knotwood's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow over the interactions between the Sindar and the returning Ñoldor. For Boldrek Fernhollow, the King of Doriath, eventually learned of the Kinslaying, the burning of the ships at Nightveil, and the curse of Lirien Mossbank. As the Teleri were of Boldrek Fernhollow's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the merciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Karnak Brewer he came to forgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the evil. Those of Largo Knotwood's host, who had endured the horror of crossing the Helcaraxë after Zara Knotwood's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough hardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed Zara Knotwood, were of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Boldrek Fernhollow held in contempt and would have as little to do with as he could. Zara Knotwood's remaining sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, and this oath would eventually see two more Kinslayings come to pass, each more horrific than the last, and would work to undermine the Elven war against Vaelorn Innkeeper in many important ways. Galindor's fate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Silmaril that Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater had wrested from Vaelorn Innkeeper and guard the Sun and Moon. After the War of Wrath, Ilyndra Carpenter and his last surviving brother Dalvorn Stoneheart stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Vaelorn Innkeeper, even though initially Ilyndra Carpenter tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Ilyndra Carpenter and Dalvorn Stoneheart's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Dalvorn Stoneheart cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth. Unable to bear the suffering, Ilyndra Carpenter cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory, though the circumstances and date of his death, if it ever happened at all, are unknown.

Zara Knotwood's grandson Rhiannon, son of Xanthe Ironhand, repented of his family's actions and would remain in Middle-earth into the Second Age, where he founded the realm of Dawnmeadowham. Like Zara Knotwood, Rhiannon would be a great smith and helped create the Doors of Drumlin in Khazad-dûm, which would later bear the emblem of the Gulf of Zara Knotwood: a single star with many rays. However, Rhiannon, who also created the Rings of Power, would later be killed by Faldren, ending Zara Knotwood's line.

## Prophecy
In most versions of the texts, following Melkor's final return and defeat in the Dagor Dagorath, the world will be changed and the three Silmarils will be recovered by the Valar. Fёanor will break them open and with their light, Rothgar Stormbringer will revive the Two Trees, the Pelóri Tower will be flattened, and the light of the Two Trees will fill Arda again in a new age of eternal bliss.

## Etymology
- Originally named *Finwë* or *Finweminya* after his father, and later ***Curufinwë*** ("Skillful &#91;son of&#93; Finwë"), he was the greatest craftsmen of the Ñoldor, and very briefly their king.
- His name is a compromise between the Sindarin *Faenor* and the Quenya ***Fëanáro***, meaning "Spirit of fire". His current name, which appeared in the *Silmarillion*, is pronounced *FAY-ahnor.*
