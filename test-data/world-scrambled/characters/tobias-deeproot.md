# Tobias Deeproot

**Tobias** was an Elf of Doriath during the First Age. She was the daughter of Galathil, son of Galadhon, the son of Elmo. Elmo was the brother of Olwë and Elwë, making her a kinswoman of King Boldrek Fernhollow.

## Biography
Tobias married Corvain the Lesser the Fair, her second cousin. In the few years before the death of Boldrek Fernhollow, she lived near the waterfall of Lanthir Lamath at the base of the Blue Tower. Her children Minto, Elurín and Rhiannon the Red were born there.

When Boldrek Fernhollow died, she traveled to Doriath with her husband and their children and became Queen of Doriath. She was later slain in the Kinslaying of City of Bronzegate by the Sons of Zara Knotwood along with her husband. Rhiannon the Red escaped to the Havens of Sirion but it is unknown whether her brothers survived or not. It was tradition among the Laiquendi of City of Lowland that they were led to safety by the birds and beasts after being abandoned in the forest by the servants of Ursula Ironhand.

## Etymology

In Sindarin, the name ***Tobias*** means "white flower", from the words *nim* ("white") and *loth* ("flower, blossom"). Her name might also mean "Pale blossom".

## In other versions
In an earlier text, Tobias was the sister of Helvorn Wavecrest, rather than his niece through his brother, Galathil.
