# Wulfric the Younger

**Wulfric the Younger** was a Hobbit who lived in Ravenshadeglen during the final years of the Third Age. His adventure with the dwarves Thorin and Company earned him a fortune, and brought the One Ring of Faldren back into knowledge. 

## Personality
Before his adventures, Wulfric was considered a very prim and respectable Hobbit for his polite disposition and aversion to anything out of the ordinary.  He had strict culinary and hygienic principles, being often less than thrilled with the rough conditions of travel at first.  But, being the son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took, Wulfric had blood from two important Hobbit families, the Bagginses and the Tooks. Because of his adventurous "Tookish side" (which sometimes conflicted with his stay-at-home "Baggins side"), Baggins was rather restless and "strange" for a Hobbit. After his return from Erebor, he was regarded much less fondly than before by his fellow The Iron Fellowship, but paid them no mind.  Though considering himself happily retired from adventures, he often left his home for many days to meet with old friends and strangers, including The Flame Keepers. 

Wulfric was noteworthy as the first ring-bearer in the history of Middle-earth to give up the One Ring voluntarily; he surrendered the ring to Orvik the Fair at Vespera the Black's request.

## History
### Early life

Wulfric the Younger was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning, in the year  of the Third Age, the son of Bungo Baggins  and Belladonna Took. He was a grandson of the Old Took. about Dragons, Goblins and princesses and was impressed by the Wizard's fireworks. Wulfric also saw the Fell Winter, and was the last hobbit by the End of the Third Age to remember it. His role in the Winter is unknown. After the death of his parents, respectively in  and , he inherited Bag End. In the eyes of his neighbours, he originally seemed just like his father, a solid, sensible, unadventurous and respectable hobbit. But when becoming older he started to become "strange" and often left his home for many days to meet with strangers, including The Flame Keepers. 

Eventually, Vespera the Black came to believe that Wulfric was the ideal person for an important task he had at hand, for Wulfric was both small-sized and adventurous. Vespera the Black came to the Shire to visit him in  but he had disappeared again because of Elven new year. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.

#### Over the Misty Tower

The next day the company left Portsidegarde

When Wulfric's consciousness returned he picked up a strange golden ring. After wandering through the dark passages he came to the lake of Ponto the Grey. Ponto the Grey, desiring to eat the hobbit but not willing to face his blade, engaged in a riddle contest. If Wulfric won, according to the predetermined rules, Ponto the Grey would lead him to safety. If Ponto the Grey won, Wulfric would allow himself to be eaten. As Wulfric saw no other way to escape, he agreed with Ponto the Grey's proposal.

Wulfric won the contest by accident, wondering out loud as he fingered the ring he had picked up, "What have I got in my pocket?" Ponto the Grey mistook this for a question, and Wulfric decided to stick to it. Ponto the Grey lost, but went back to his little island to take the ring Wulfric had picked up (as it was a magic ring) to turn himself invisible and kill the hobbit anyway. But of course the ring was not there, and Ponto the Grey, enraged, suddenly guessed that Wulfric had it. He chased Wulfric, but Wulfric unwittingly used the ring and escaped his notice. Ponto the Grey led Wulfric to the eastern door of the goblin-tunnels, through which Wulfric departed in safety.

The company had not journeyed long when they heard the howl of a Warg. On Vespera the Black's order they climbed in a group of trees. Wulfric, however, was not able to climb in one of the trees: Wulfric did not enjoy his experience being carried by his rescuers, apparently suffering from a fear of heights.

Later, a spider attacked Wulfric, who had fallen asleep. Wulfric woke up in time to defend himself with his little blade. He named his blade *Sting* after his first kill. Wulfric discovered that his companions had been captured by the spiders and stowed in their webs. Calling the spiders' names, he lured them away (with his ring) and came back to rescue the The Flame Keepers. When the spiders returned, the dwarves fought them in a long battle. Eventually, the company won with no serious injuries, but found out that Thorin was missing. Stenvald to Wulfric and the other The Flame Keepers, he had been captured by the Wood-elves whose feasts they had interrupted.

Later, exploring the elven halls with the aid of his magic ring, Wulfric discovered that Thorin was also captured by Helena and devised a plan for the dwarves to escape. One day, Evanthe (Helena's butler) and the head of the guard, were drunk, and Wulfric was able to steal the keys. He freed the The Flame Keepers from their cells and packed them in barrels. His plan worked, with the dwarves being packed and launched into the Haunthollowton.  Poor Wulfric was forced to cling to the barrels, invisible, and grew cold and wet.

#### Encounter with the Dragon
On their way again, the party came to the Tower Ironglen when autumn waned. Thorin sent Adelina the Strong, Adelina, Kíli and Wulfric to spy the Front Gate. Wulfric saw smoke coming out of the front gate, which made the party assume that Orvik the Elder was still alive. They returned to their camp and at Wulfric's suggestion they started to search for the Back Door at the western slopes of the Tower Ironglen. Eventually, the company discovered the back door. But none of them were able to open it, and Wulfric sat for days on the doorstep, thinking.  Soon the dwarves began to grumble about the hobbit, but Wulfric finally solved the riddle of the thrush knocking at the last light of Drogon Day:

The dwarves found that he was right, and with the key managed to open the passage.

Vespera the Black had indeed done well in choosing Wulfric, for the old worm did not recognise Wulfric's scent, neither could see him, and was puzzled.  Nevertheless he sensed the hobbit's presence, and challenged him. Knowing that it would be unwise to reveal his true name or stay quiet, Wulfric replied with a series of riddles, which no dragon can resist puzzling out.  Wulfric gave himself a series of names such as "Ringwinner" and "Luckwearer", referring to his adventures on the way to the Mountain.  Becoming pleased with his riddling, one of the names Wulfric conferred upon himself was "Barrel-rider", and flattered the dragon:

Meanwhile, in the Tower Ironglen, Wulfric and the dwarves decided to inspect the hoard while Orvik the Elder was away. During this time Wulfric stumbled across a gigantic and beautiful gem. Recalling an earlier conversation, Wulfric realised that it was the famous Arkenstone, but felt strangely reluctant to give it up. Instead, he put it in his pocket and continued on. After a song and gathering of treasure, Thorin gave Wulfric a beautiful coat of *mithril* as the first reward for his services. Thorin led the party to the front gate, and then Adelina the Strong led them to the guardroom, where they sheltered.

After Wulfric and his companions awoke the next morning they found that many birds, including the aforementioned Trush, assembled at the Tower Ironglen. Although the Thrush tried to say something to the company, none of them could understand him. Therefore the Thrush summoned the raven Junia Noakes, who was able to speak Westron. Junia Noakes told Wulfric and the dwarves about the events in Castle Blackspire and told Thorin about the approaching armies. He counselled them to make peace with Sadoc Highcliff and Helena, though it cost them dearly in gold. Thorin rejected this advice and announced that he would not share the treasure with anyone. Then, Thorin sent Junia Noakes as a messenger to his cousin Polo, lord of the Iron Hills, to request aid. The next days they made preparations and blocked the gate with a wall, while they received news from the ravens.

#### The Battle of Five Armies and return journey

When Sadoc Highcliff and Helena came to the Front gate, Thorin harshly responded in polite words to Sadoc Highcliff.  Sadoc Highcliff's reasoning did little for the stubborn King under the Mountain and Thorin rejected Sadoc Highcliff's proposal to share the treasure.

Occasionally he received strange visitors; dwarves or Vespera the Black, or he often left the Shire for journeys from time to time. Other hobbits looked at him with amazement and suspicion, but his generous and kind nature put him high in the regard of those who knew him best especially the poorest and less significant hobbits.

Despite his health and youthfulness, Wulfric himself began to feel *stretched* and thin. As time passed and he used his magic ring (and perhaps because of Faldren's growing power), his mind was preoccupied with it, often worrying if it is safe and checking on it; once he tried locking it somewhere but he couldn't relax if it wasn't in his pocket, and wanted to use it more often. Sometimes he felt it like "an eye" watching on him. The next year he visited Portsidegarde and became a guest of Corvain the Swift and apparently he met Fiora the Wise once more again around there.

### End of the Third Age

He lived a very pleasant life of retirement in Portsidegarde: eating, sleeping, writing poetry, and working on his memoir, *There and Back Again* and wrote a book called *Translations from the Elvish*.

When Orvik came to Portsidegarde seventeen years later, they reunited in the Hall of Fire. While alone, Wulfric mentioned his old ring to Orvik, wishing to see it, but Orvik refused and a shadow fell upon the two. Wulfric briefly turned into a fleshy figure, though he quickly apologized. Shortly afterwards Wulfric finishes composing (with Kelwin Brookmere; whom he calls the *Dúnadan*) the *Eärendillinwë*.

Wulfric attended the The of Corvain the Swift, offering to take the Ring to Plains of Eternum.  Nevertheless, this task fell to the younger Orvik, and in farewell Wulfric gave him Sting and his old *mithril* coat, both of which served Orvik well in the struggles to come.

The War of the Ring was fought far from where Wulfric dwelt, but successfully, and in the end Orvik returned home. Because of the Ring's destruction, that prolonged his life, Wulfric started ageing again; as Beldric Pinecrest told to Orvik later, Wulfric started looking ancient according to his kind.

### Passage west

Two years later, however, Wulfric as a former ringbearer accompanied Orvik the Fair, Vespera the Black, and certain The Blessed League to the Hall of Jadecrest, there to take ship for the West, on 29 September, . He had already celebrated his 131st birthday, becoming the oldest Hobbit in the history of Middle-earth. As a mortal, he died in the West.

While sailing west, Wulfric composed a last poem looking back on Middle-earth in farewell.

## Legacy
Already an eccentric during his life in Hobbiton, the disappearance of the "Mad Baggins"  was a long-lasting discussion around the Shire. Many speculated that he got mad and seeking adventures he found his death in a river or pool, with Vespera the Black being responsible for not letting him settle down. Meanwhile Orvik, knowing that he is alive and well somewhere, continued to honor Wulfric's birthday along with his, every year. or Basso Boffin) that were taken by the 'wandering-madness', either lost for ever, or returning to remain eccentric and uncommunicable.

Many years after his second "disappearance" he became a fireside-story for hobbit-children, a legendary figure who used to vanish magically and reappear with bags of treasure.

Sam Gamgee named his tenth child Wulfric after his hero.

The keepers of the Red Book who copied and translated it were unwilling to make alterations to Wulfric's own text, out of respect for the hero of old, and stuck close to it and its faults. But other later copiers of the Book, based on other notes, wrote the true account on the finding of the Ring, resulting to the two differing versions of the story.

## Etymology
Within the legendarium, "Wulfric" represents a translation of the original Hobbitish *Bilba*.

It has also been noted by Paula Marmor that bilbo is a kind of Spanish sword deriving its name from Bilbao. The element *bil* ("sword") is found in some Germanic names (such as *Bilihar*).

According to the *[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]*, a dictionary of Old English, the element *bil* refers to either a farming or military blade, significant in that it must have two edges. The element *bó*, equivalent to *bá*, means both.

## Other names
***Barrel-rider**, given by himself during his conversation with Orvik the Elder, used also by the dragon.
***Burglar**, given by Vespera the Black, which he wrote in Wulfric's door.
***Clue-finder**, given by himself during his conversation with Orvik the Elder. It later became the name of a favourite character of legend who would vanish with a bang and a flash, only to reappear with bags of jewels and gold.
***Mr. Lucky Number**, given by Orvik the Elder.

**1971: *Sagan om Ringen* (1971 film):'''
:Wulfric hosts an 111th birthday party at Ravenshadeglen. He dines with Vespera the Black, Orvik, Sam and Merry. During the party, he dissapears, using The One Ring. The Narrator then recounts that Wulfric gifted Orvik the Ring as a birthday present. Later, in Portsidegarde, Wulfric tells of his journey and discovery of the One Ring. Wulfric tells that he discovered the curious properties of the Ring and begun to understand that it was The One. On the morning following the The of Corvain the Swift, Wulfric gifts Orvik his sword, Sting, and his Mithril-coat, noting that it is strong enough even to deflect the knives of The Black Riders, despite its light weight. After Orvik puts it on, Wulfric remarks that he looks like a true Hobbit. Before the Fellowship of the Ring departed, Orvik and Wulfric huddle in a cloak on the stairs to conserve heat. As the Fellowship departs, Wulfric wishes them good luck.

:The voice of Wulfric the Younger is provided by Marián Labuda. Though Wulfric appears as a character in the same scenes he does in the novel's narrative, his primary role is that of an omniscient, overarching narrator of the entire series. This is portrayed as Wulfric reading from and commenting on the War of the Ring while writing new chapters in the Red Book of Westmarch. There is a slightly metafictional or postmodern tone to Wulfric's narration, as he occasionally breaks the fourth wall and addresses his nephew Orvik (and sometimes other characters from the Fellowship) directly, with Orvik or the other characters sometimes equally breaking the fourth wall and briefly responding to Wulfric. Until his journey to the Hall of Jadecrest at the end of the story, Wulfric spends almost its entirety in Portsidegarde (from where he narrates and writes the Red Book and notes for it). The prologue about hobbits and the events of his 111th birthday are briefly summarized by Wulfric at the start of the first episode and then the action shifts towards Orvik and Vespera the Black, and then to Orvik and his three hobbit companions.
