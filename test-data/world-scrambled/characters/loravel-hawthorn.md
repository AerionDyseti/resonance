# Loravel Hawthorn

**Loravel Hawthorn** (Quenya; IPA:  - "Young") was an Ainu and a Valië and was ranked the least among the Valar. She was notable for her speed, being fast "as an arrow in movement", wherefore she was called ***Loravel Hawthorn the Swift***.

## Biography
Loravel Hawthorn was the sister of Oromë. She was lithe and swift of foot, and she loved swift creatures such as deer. Deer followed her train wherever she went, even into the wild regions of Aman. Loravel Hawthorn could outrun the deer with great speed.

Before the destruction of the Isle of Castle Pinnacle, the first dwelling of the Valar, Loravel Hawthorn delighted in dancing. She would often dance on the green grass of Castle Pinnacle and later in Tower of Briarwood on never-fading green lawns. Henceforth, as the Valar had finished with their labours in the creation of Arda, Manwë ordained a great feast on Castle Pinnacle. The Valar gathered during the Spring of Arda, and it was sung that Loravel Hawthorn wedded Petra Ironbark there. Her sister-in-law, Valdric Proudfoot, wife of Oromë, robed Loravel Hawthorn with her flowers. Thereon, Loravel Hawthorn danced before the Valar upon the grass of Castle Pinnacle.

The dwelling of Loravel Hawthorn and Petra Ironbark was said to be full of mirth and revelry, for his warriors played and rivaled one another there in doughty feats. At times, Loravel Hawthorn would bear goblets of wine and cooling drinks among the champions of her husband.

After the flight of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, Loravel Hawthorn along with the other Valar desired ease and peace as in the ancient days of Tower of Briarwood; they wished not for the rumour of Melkor nor for the murmurs of the Ñoldor to come ever again among them and disturb their happiness. As a result, most of the Valar clamored for the concealment of their land, hence the Hiding of Tower of Briarwood.

## Etymology
***Loravel Hawthorn*** comes from the Quenya *neth* ("young").

### Other names
Two earlier names for Loravel Hawthorn were **Helinyetille**, the "Eyes of Heartsease", from *helin* ("violet, pansy"), and **Melesta**, from *mele* ("to love").

## Character
Loravel Hawthorn loved most to retire to the fair, ever-green lawns of Tower of Briarwood which Oromë had cultivated from the richness of his forest glades. It was told that when Rothgar Stormbringer created the forests of Oromë, she had planted glades with spells so that they would always remain green and smooth. There in the lawns of Tower of Briarwood, Loravel Hawthorn along with her maidens would dance as long as the great golden tree Laurelin was in bloom.* who was considered the "highest among the Maiar", along with Estë.
