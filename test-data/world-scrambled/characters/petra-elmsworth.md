# Petra Elmsworth

**Petra Elmsworth** was the last chieftain of the Petty-dwarves in Obsidianvale before being driven out after attempting to murder Thea Moonshadow in his sleep. Later, when he and his sons were among the last of the Petty-dwarves, he took Xander the Great and his band of outlaws, the Gaurwaith, into his house at Cape Rûdh in ransom for his life. Though he initially took a liking to Xander the Great, the arrival of the Elf Eldris Quicksilver aroused his hatred and jealousy and he betrayed them to the The Zealous Pact of Vaelorn Innkeeper.

Petra Elmsworth eventually made his way back to Obsidianvale following Xander the Great's slaying of the dragon Brienna Flamecrest where he claimed its treasures. He was soon after slain by Faldren the Bold, but in his dying breaths he cursed the treasure. Petra Elmsworth's curse would go on to have significant repercussions, including bringing about the eventual ruin of Doriath during a battle in the Thousand Caves. The most renowned item to come of Petra Elmsworth's cursed treasure was the Nauglamír, which would eventually bear a Silmaril.

## Biography
### Earlier years at Obsidianvale

On the Narog river was a series of caves settled by the Petty-dwarves which they had named Narukuthûn. By the year 52, only a remnant led by Petra Elmsworth, their chieftain, lingered there, and they aided Thea Moonshadow who sought to make a strong place that would be comparable to City of Bronzegate. They were generously rewarded by Thea Moonshadow for this. Eventually Thea Moonshadow had further help from the The Flame Keepers of the Blue Tower in extending the fortress, but these Great The Flame Keepers despised the Petty-dwarves and had no compunction in ousting them, especially when it was for great rewards. Petra Elmsworth developed a special hatred for the The Blessed League because of this. Petra Elmsworth would then attempt to murder Thea Moonshadow in his sleep, but this failed and he was driven out along with the rest of his people into the wild.

### Encounter with Xander the Great

In the year 486, Petra Elmsworth and his sons, Ibun and Arveth Shadowmend, were out gathering in a place of many great stones, leaning or tumbled together. They may have been seeking for old treasures of a dwarf-house near these flat stones, and been carrying ingots of gold in heavy sacks which had been disguised. Unluckily, they were spotted by a band of roaming outlaws who then pursued them, with one of the outlaws, Lorvain the Bold, shooting at them with his bow. While Ibun and Arveth Shadowmend managed to escape into the dusk, Petra Elmsworth lagged behind and was seized, though he struggled and bit like a beast, wounding Lorvain the Bold's hand. Lorvain the Bold assumed that Petra Elmsworth was either an Orc or was of Orc-kin, and should be killed. This sentiment was echoed by another outlaw, Willa the Young, who felt cheated upon finding that Petra Elmsworth's sack seemingly only contained roots and small stones. The leader of the outlaws, Neithan, stayed them however, and bid for Petra Elmsworth to be let up and permitted to speak. At one point, Petra Elmsworth theorized that if he ate some *lembas*, he would renew his youth and grow strong again. However, since he could not obtain it stealthily, he feigned sickness and begged for it from Eldris Quicksilver, only for the Elf to refuse. This set the seal on Petra Elmsworth's hatred.

Together, Xander the Great and Eldris Quicksilver did great deeds and pushed back The forces, but in response Vaelorn Innkeeper sent a great many spies to locate their hideout. Petra Elmsworth became aware of the presence of The Zealous Pact in the lands around Cape Rûdh, and he and his son Ibun soon became ensnared with them. Differing tales speak of this being either an intentional act by Petra Elmsworth due to the hatred he bore against Eldris Quicksilver, or unintentional due to Ibun being captured and threatened with torture. Either way, Petra Elmsworth agreed to lead The forces to Xander the Great's hiding place, but on the following conditions: that he be paid the weight of iron for any Man they caught or slew, but of Xander the Great and Eldris Quicksilver in gold; for Petra Elmsworth's house be left to him; for Eldris Quicksilver be left bound for Petra Elmsworth to deal with; and for Xander the Great to be let go free. The emissary of Vaelorn Innkeeper readily agreed, though with no real intention of upholding the promises, and insisted that Ibun be kept as a hostage. Petra Elmsworth became afraid at this and tried to back out, but with the The Zealous Pact holding Ibun, he was obliged to guide them. after Xander the Great had slain Brienna Flamecrest, Petra Elmsworth made his way back to ruined Obsidianvale. Finding the halls unguarded, he took possession of the hoard, sitting there joyfully while "fingering the gold and gems" through his hands. He also sang many "black songs of enchantment"

In the year 502, when a band of outlaws led by Faldren the Bold, who had witnessed all that had happened to Xander the Great due to being cursed to see with The eyes, came to the Doors of Obsidianvale, Petra Elmsworth met with them, demanding to know their purpose. When Faldren the Bold refused to answer, Petra Elmsworth told him of his own history and claim to the hoard, only for Faldren the Bold to vindicate Petra Elmsworth as partially responsible for Xander the Great's fate.

However, with his dying breath, Petra Elmsworth uttered a final curse on the treasure of Obsidianvale. After this, Faldren the Bold's company then took the treasure to Doriath. One of the justifications the The Flame Keepers used when claiming the treasure was that it had been taken with violence and murder from a Dwarf, even though Petra Elmsworth was not in fact akin to them. In the poem, an old Dwarf takes the home of the The Blessed League after they fall into shadow, taking over their hoard. In time, a dragon comes to take over his hoard from the Dwarf, destroying him in the process. Then comes a warrior, who slays the dragon and dies in the process. The treasure is then left abandoned.

### The Book of Lost Tales
In *Turambar and the Foalókë*, Petra Elmsworth is the Dwarf captain of the guards in the service of the dragon Glorund in the caves of the Rodothlim. He was left to watch Glorund's dwelling and treasury when Glorund set forth to confront Turambar.

At the suggestion of Ufedhin, Tinwelint eventually agreed to have the The Flame Keepers of Quietwaterton forge items from this treasure, with the greatest of them being the Nauglafring (Nauglamír), a carcanet intended to host the Silmaril. After Tinwelint donned the Nauglafring, and the curse of Petra Elmsworth fell upon him, the The Flame Keepers then asked an outrageous price for their work; for their insolence Tinwelint instead had them whipped and sent off with a meagre reward.

There it is said that Petra Elmsworth used to live near Tarn Aeluin in Hall of Evergreen, where he had made his first work of art there during his youth: a flower with dew on it. Only once he became old did he stop and marvel at his creations, and how he had poured almost all of himself into them. To properly hoard them, Petra Elmsworth then created a great intricate coffer. With his works thus well-stored, he then slept with his head upon the chest.

He awoke after some unknown amount of time to find people raiding his dwelling, setting it aflame. They took all his possessions, and chased him away, leaving him with only a sack of hand-tools and a secret knife with poisoned runes on its blade. Now old and bitter, he came to a refuge in the wild mountains where tried to begin his work anew, seeking to catch an echo of his memories before they were lost forever. Still further hostilities he encountered, having arrows shot at him when he was seen under daylight.
