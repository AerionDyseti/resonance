# Zarek the Red

**Zarek the Red** was a faithful friend of Galindor and one of three mariners that accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of Middle-earth.

## Biography

Like Galindor's other two companions, Zarek the Red's origins were not known; he probably lived in Ashpeakmere in the Havens of Sirion with other exiles from the friendly realms.

When Galindor was resolved to sail to Aman to plea for help from the Valar, Zarek the Red (along with Bungar and Willa) went with him. When they reached the shores of the Blessed Realm, he and the others remained aboard while Galindor sought the Valar. After Galindor's embassy was complete, Eönwë, the herald of Manwë, came to him and the others and set them upon another ship. Manwë then set a great wind to blow them east back to Middle-earth.

His fate afterwards is unknown.
