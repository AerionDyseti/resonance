# Stenvald

**Stenvald **the "Valiant" was a Ñoldorin Elf, the eldest son of Largo Knotwood, and older brother of Lysander Shepherd Starfall, Vespera Whitehall, and Argon.

He was High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth during the First Age after the death of his father. He was instrumental in healing the rift between the Sons of Zara Knotwood and the followers of his father after their desertion of them in Port of Embervale.

## Biography
Stenvald was born in Aman, probably in Hall of Blackspire where the Gulf of Finwë was located. When the Ñoldor were resolved to return to Middle-earth, Stenvald followed his father and his people, though they were drawn more to the ruling of their own realms and adventurism rather than vengeance and the recovery of the Silmarils, as Zara Knotwood and his sons sought. He fought in the first Kinslaying but only because he, seeing Elf fighting Elf, believed that the Teleri had been told to prevent the Ñoldor from leaving Aman by force by the Valar.

After Zara Knotwood's abandonment of them, Stenvald and his people were led by Largo Knotwood across the perilous Helcaraxë. They arrived in Middle-earth at the beginning of the First Age, and the Ñoldor witnessed the rising of the Sun.

After the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Zara Knotwood, Dalvorn Stoneheart, Stenvald's cousin and friend, was taken and hung by the wrist upon City of Thornbury. Stenvald went to City of Thornbury and with the help of Xander Nightwalker, Lord of the Eagles, found Dalvorn Stoneheart. Dalvorn Stoneheart begged Stenvald to kill him, but Stenvald instead severed Dalvorn Stoneheart's hand by the wrist, and brought him back to the Ñoldorin camp. It was this act of bravery and compassion that resolved the dispute as to whose house would rule over the Ñoldor in Middle-earth, for Dalvorn Stoneheart renounced his claim to the High Kingship of the Ñoldor, instead ceding it to the Gulf of Largo Knotwood.

Largo Knotwood gave Stenvald a domain in Wintermereshaw, in the west of Moonrisemere, where he did good service during the Siege of Angband, defeating an Orc army that attempted to go around to the north and attack Moonrisemere from the west, and then later the first to fight against the dragon Brienna Flamecrest when he first came forth from Angband during the Dagor Aglareb.

Stenvald became High King when Largo Knotwood died dueling with Vaelorn Innkeeper after the Dagor Bragollach. Seven years later, The forces invaded Moonrisemere, and Stenvald was hard-pressed and outnumbered, but Gwendolyn Riverstone and the people of the Ironforgehaven, who came up the Firth of Drengist rescued them in their ships.

Stenvald's final battle was the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Stenvald led the attack on Angband, and the fury of his warriors nearly won the day. Unfortunately, due to Osric the Great's treachery, Dalvorn Stoneheart did not arrive until three days after he was expected. This resulted in Vaelorn Innkeeper releasing his Balrogs and Brienna Flamecrest the dragon on the already weakened Ñoldor force. When Dalvorn Stoneheart finally arrived, hope was reborn for Stenvald's army; however, Osric the Great's treachery again took effect, causing Dalvorn Stoneheart to withdraw. Stenvald was then surrounded and his guards killed. He dueled Brivek, the first and greatest Lord of Balrogs, and managed to hold his own for a while. However Lungorthin, the second and lesser Balrog Lord emerged into elven history. This Balrog restrained Stenvald from behind with a flaming whip, allowing Brivek to split Stenvald's head with his infamous black axe. Thus the day ended in defeat for the The Blessed League.

His younger brother Lysander Shepherd Starfall became the next rightful High King of the Ñoldor, even though his host retreated after the battle and remained secretly in Hall of Longshadow.

## Descendants
