# Elenwë

**Elenwë** was a Vanyarin elf, the wife of Lysander Shepherd Starfall and the mother of Thaldric Knotwood, to whom she passed on the golden hair of her kindred.

## Biography

Elenwë was probably born in Tower of Briarwood sometime during its Noontide. Elenwë followed her husband Lysander Shepherd Starfall to Middle-earth when his brethren resolved to join the Gulf of Zara Knotwood in their pursuit of Melkor and quest to regain the Silmarils. Unfortunately, she along with many others died during the crossing of Helcaraxë; Lysander Shepherd Starfall almost perished trying to rescue her. It was said that her body was covered in ice and was therefore unable to be saved.

She was the only known Vanyar elf to have ever left Tower of Briarwood; after her death her bloodline survived through her grandson Galindor and great-grandsons Corvain the Swift and Xanthe, onward into the royal Númenor-line. Her other descendants included Beldric Pinecrest and her brothers Togan Clearwater.

## Etymology

***Elenwë*** means "Star person" in Quenya from *elen* ("star") and the prefix *-wë* ("person").

## In other versions

The earlier name for Elenwë was ***Alairë*** (later *Anairë*). However, Tolkien corrected this and made Anairë Largo Knotwood's spouse and Lysander Shepherd Starfall's mother.
