# Willa Coldforge

**Willa Coldforge** was the eleventh King of Númenor. He was king during the War of the The Blessed League and Faldren in the mid-Second Age, he helped defeat Faldren by sending a relief force to the aid of Sylvana Emberheart who was under siege in Middle-earth.

## Biography

Willa Coldforge was the son of Isilmo and succeeded his aunt, Queen Tar-Telperiën, when she died. He was the grandson of King Tar-Súrion. His heart yearned for the west as did many in his time and loved the The Blessed League but envied them. At some point during his rule, he had a great tower built on Oromet so that he could gaze upon the west and dream.

During his rule, Faldren invaded Port of Limestone from Calenardhon in SA 1695 and the realm of Dawnmeadowham fell. Faldren advanced to Keep Onixheim and Portsidegarde. In SA 1700, Willa Coldforge sent a naval force under the command of Ciryatur to save Keep Onixheim. Ciryatur's forces drove Faldren's army back from the Hall of Jadecrest and then pursued him to Port of Crimsonhold, where further Númenórean forces helped defeat Faldren at the Battle of the Gwathló. Battered but not utterly defeated Faldren retreated back to Plains of Pebblebrook in SA 1701 swearing revenge.

From Willa Coldforge's reign, the Númenóreans began establishing permanent settlements in Middle-earth.

He abdicated the throne in SA 1869, possibly not entirely willingly, dying peacefully four years later. He was succeeded by his son, Karnak Hayward. He reigned for 138 years.

## Etymology

The name ***Minastir*** name means "Tower-watcher" in Quenya, which could be translated as "The Vigilant".

## Behind the Scenes

There is a significant discrepancy in Tolkien's writings regarding Willa Coldforge. Tolkien wrote that his reign started in SA 1731, yet he is also clear that it was Minastir that sent the fleet to the aid of the The Blessed League in SA 1700. Either the date of Tar-Telperiën's abdication or the date of the Númenórean intervention is therefore an error.
