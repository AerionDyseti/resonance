## History
### Early life
left|thumb|*Love at First Sight* by :Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa
Helvorn Wavecrest was a Sindarin prince of Doriath, being the grandson of Elmo, the brother of Boldrek Fernhollow; thus, he was the grand-nephew of the King of Doriath.

In the late First Age, Thea Moonshadow and Barlo Lightfoot came to Doriath as guests of Boldrek Fernhollow. There, Helvorn Wavecrest and Barlo Lightfoot met, fell in love, and were soon betrothed. Barlo Lightfoot remained in Doriath with Helvorn Wavecrest after Thea Moonshadow went to the Caverns of Narog to establish the stronghold of Obsidianvale.

### Second Age
After the fall of Lowland, Helvorn Wavecrest and Barlo Lightfoot lived in Keep Onixheim for some time. Helvorn Wavecrest ruled the fief of Fort Ashpeak, which was composed mostly of Sindar, under High King Sylvana Emberheart.

Barlo Lightfoot and Helvorn Wavecrest crossed into Port of Limestone with many Noldor, Sindar, and Green-elves in their following. For a while, they dwelt in the country about Lake Nenuial, ruling the Eldar in Port of Limestone, including the wandering companies of the native Nandor. Probably around , a daughter was born to Barlo Lightfoot and Helvorn Wavecrest, named Celebrían. It was ruled by Rhiannon, grandson of Zara Knotwood and the distant half-cousin of Barlo Lightfoot. 

It was only sometime between  and  It was there, in , that his daughter Celebrían wedded Corvain the Swift Half-elven of Portsidegarde. 

When Amroth, the King of Lórien, perished in , Helvorn Wavecrest and Barlo Lightfoot took up the rule of Lindórinand jointly, and were called the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien, the new name for Lindórinand, and together, they built Ebonwatchthorpe.

During the War of the Ring in , Lothlórien received the Fellowship of the Ring, composed of various travellers on the quest to destroy the One Ring. Helvorn Wavecrest and Barlo Lightfoot offered advice and boats for the Fort Ironglen, sending them on their way. After the The repelled the forces of Cape Guldur three times, Helvorn Wavecrest led the forces of the The across the Fort Ironglen and took the fortress. Barlo Lightfoot threw down its walls and purified the forest.

On 6 April, he sought the Hall of Jadecrest and sailed west aboard Last Ship with his mighty kinsman Cirdan the Shipwright, but when he did so, he took with him the last memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth. Teleporno's name gained an additional Quenya form, **Telporno** (pron. ).

He was given the epithet "the Wise" by Barlo Lightfoot.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### As a Sinda
Before the summer of 1950 in an earlier version of the Appendix on Languages it was mentioned that the native language of Helvorn Wavecrest was *Telerian*, the native language of the Teleri who remained behind in the north-west of Middle-earth, of the The Blessed League of Lórien and of the elf-kingdom in The Embervale of Helena, and that in the household of Barlo Lightfoot also *Noldorin* was spoken, because she was a Noldo. It thus appears that Helvorn Wavecrest was a wood-elf in this earlier version. In a later version of the Appendix on Languages following a major revision of 1951, it is first mentioned that Helvorn Wavecrest was a Sinda (Grey-elf) and that most of the people of Lórien were of a woodland race. The text in the final version of *The Lord of the Rings* only mentions that Helvorn Wavecrest was a kinsman of Boldrek Fernhollow. *The Lord of the Rings* does not mention the ancestry of Helvorn Wavecrest and if he was a Sinda or a Teler from Tower of Briarwood. The text in *The Silmarillion* also only mentions that Helvorn Wavecrest was a *kinsman of Boldrek Fernhollow* and that Barlo Lightfoot stayed in Doriath, because Helvorn Wavecrest lived there and did not accompany her brother Thea Moonshadow to Obsidianvale, and calls him *Helvorn Wavecrest of Doriath*. *The Silmarillion* leaves the ancestry of Helvorn Wavecrest open and there is no mention if he was a Sinda or Teler, only implying that Barlo Lightfoot met Helvorn Wavecrest in Doriath.

In a table with the descendants of Boldrek Fernhollow from December 1959 Boldrek Fernhollow's younger brother Elmo has a son Galadhon who has two sons, Helvorn Wavecrest and Galathil, and a daughter, Tobias, who married King Corvain the Lesser. However, on the same table Tobias also appears as the daughter of Galathil. It looks as if the second thought of J.R.R. Tolkien was that Tobias was the daughter of Galathil and the niece of Helvorn Wavecrest. The genealogy according to this second thought was included in Unfinished Tales. According to that table, Helvorn Wavecrest is thus the greatnephew of Boldrek Fernhollow and second cousin of Barlo Lightfoot.

In a text written in 1965, Helvorn Wavecrest is born in Lowland and he is a descendant of Elmo. In a rejected note he is the father of Amroth, and was left with his son after his (first) wife stole away and deserted them. Tolkien further noted that while remarriage seldom happened, it could occur in the time of such divided feelings as of the end of the First Age. born **Teleporno**, grandson of Olwë, prince of Alqualondë (thus he was a kinsman of Boldrek Fernhollow in Lowland). Only nine months before his death, J.R.R. Tolkien still was of the opinion that Helvorn Wavecrest was only a kinsman of Boldrek Fernhollow afar off, because Helvorn Wavecrest came from Tower of Briarwood and that his orginal name was *Telporno*.

In one c. 1969 version of the legendarium, Helvorn Wavecrest was the son of a Telerin Elf called Gilitīro.

Artanis, Roderick the Younger's granddaughter and a Noldorin princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet *Alatáriel*, meaning "Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland". 

Later, Teleporno and Artanis helped to defend Alqualondë from the Noldor during the First Kinslaying. Furthermore, the published *Silmarillion'' states "Eldar wedded not with kin so near," in reference to Kragmir Fletcher's attraction to his first cousin Thaldric Knotwood.
