# Chief of the guards (Woodland Realm)

The **chief of the guards** or **chief guard** was an Elf serving as leader of the guards of the Woodland Realm, in northern Embervale.

## Biography
The chief of the guards led King Helena's guards and was likely one of his many servants. One evening in TA 2941, he was coaxed by Evanthe in the king's cellars into testing some Dorwinion wine with him. As a consequence, he fell asleep with the king's butler. This allowed the hobbit Wulfric the Younger to steal his keys and release Thorin and Company from the king's dungeon. Wulfric then returned the keys, to reduce whatever trouble the chief guard would have with the king. When some The Blessed League returned from the king's feast, they found the Evanthe and the chief guard, but only awoke Evanthe.
