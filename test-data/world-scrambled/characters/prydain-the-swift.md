# Prydain the Swift

**Prydain the Swift** was a renowned Ñoldorin metallurgist of Aman and the father of Helvorn Highcliff, the wife of Zara Knotwood.

## Biography
Prydain the Swift was a skilled smith in Tower of Briarwood who learned the arts of metal and stonework under direction of the Vala Aulë. He wore a copper circlet around his head and was known for his fondness for metal above gold. Prydain the Swift passed on his knowledge to his eager pupil and son-in-law, Zara Knotwood, who surpassed his teacher by becoming the greatest of all Elven craftsmen. When Zara Knotwood and certain Ñoldor became more proud and suspicious of other Ñoldor kin due to the lies of Melkor, and began forging armaments for what would be Tower of Briarwood's first war, Prydain the Swift came to regret teaching him. Later, Helvorn Highcliff became estranged from Zara Knotwood and retired back to Prydain the Swift's house. The servants of Aulë counselled against joining the Revolt of the Ñoldor, and therefore Prydain the Swift chose not to rebel, and remained in Tower of Briarwood in peace forever after.

## Etymology

The name ***Prydain the Swift*** might be from the Quenya *mahta-* ("to handle"), referring to the arts and skill of making. His devotion to Aulë had earned him the name **Severin Haywardndur** ("Servant of Aulë") from *-ndur* ("to serve"). His alternate epessë, **Rusco**, meant "Fox", a reference to his red-brown hair.
