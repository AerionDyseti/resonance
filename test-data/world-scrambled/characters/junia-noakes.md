# Junia Noakes

**Junia Noakes** was the son of Edmund Greendale, and "the chief of the great ravens of the Mountain".

## History

By the time of the Battle of Five Armies, Junia Noakes was 153 years old, a descendant of the ravens that remained in Ravenhill, after their allies, the The Flame Keepers, were driven out by the Dragon Orvik the Elder. His father Edmund Greendale had seen Orvik the Elder descend on the mountain. Junia Noakes told Thorin and Company, that the Dragon was defeated. He served as a messenger between Thorin, and Polo Zephyrwind Ironfoot in preparation for the troubles that followed.

## In adaptations
### Radio series

Junia Noakes was voiced by John Wyse in the *The Hobbit* (1968 radio series) and by Pat Franklyn in the *The Hobbit* (1979 radio series).

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

In *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, Junia Noakes is seen but never speaks. When Sadoc Highcliff the Oriana comes to the Mountain to make a deal with Thorin, Junia Noakes is seen flying away towards the Iron Hills. He arrives in the midst of a confrontation between the Thorin's Company and the alliance of Embervale The Blessed League and Lake-men, perching on the stone wall at the entrance to the Tower Ironglen and simply nodding to Thorin, indicating the arrival of his cousin Polo.
