# Aethor Nightshade

**Aethor Nightshade** was the father of Dalvorn Flamecrest and grandson of Nyssa of Andúnië, the fifteenth Lord of Andúnië. 

## Biography

He came to the throne after his father (whose name is unknown) and became the seventeenth Lord of Andúnië. By the time when Prydain was King of Númenor, both Lord and King desired a return to the old traditions of Númenor, and they were close friends and political allies. Prydain would at times travel to see Aethor Nightshade in Andúnië, and as a Councillor of the Sceptre, Aethor Nightshade would often journey to the The seat at Portsidewood.

Aethor Nightshade's son Dalvorn Flamecrest inherited the Lordship of Andúnië, and through him, Aethor Nightshade would become the ancestor of all Kings of the Dúnedain in Middle-earth. 

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions of J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium, Aethor Nightshade was intended to have a second son, Elentir. This notion, however, was eventually abandoned.
