## Role/Occupation

Teacher at the Monastery of the Gates Dance in Vrasillex; expert in dunamancy and temporal philosophy.

## Description

A Dro'adi master whose living fungal tattoos glow and shimmer with inner light. Patient and perceptive, he carries the quiet weight of one who has seen much. Speaks almost exclusively in questions, guiding others to their own conclusions rather than providing answers directly.

## Background

Longo Shadowmend trained Quinlan at the Monastery of the Gates Dance. His trance has recently been troubled—a "splinter in the mind"—due to the worsening temporal disturbances in the Lake Knightfall. He has noted that the green star concerns him, despite the Amtreadi scholar Amathien's dismissal of it as a "seasonal phenomenon."

## Personality

- Speaks in questions rather than statements
- Patient and unhurried in his wisdom
- Trusts his former students deeply
- Carries concern for the growing temporal disturbances

## Notable Characteristics

- The fungal tattoos that glow and shimmer
- Can sense unusual temporal weight around individuals
- Has contacts at the monastery who can communicate across distances

## Campaign Highlights

### Heroes for Hire

**Session 9**: Met with the party in the Falls of Quartzfall of Gulf Shæbridin. Discussed the nature of fate, inevitability, and temporal intervention. Warned that "those who tried to alter what they saw never found their way back to any shore." Agreed to check on the status of Kora and Minto through monastery contacts.
