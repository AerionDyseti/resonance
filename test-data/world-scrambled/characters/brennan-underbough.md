# Brennan Underbough

**Brennan Underbough** was an Adan and the first lord, chieftain of his people who were numerous compared to the other houses of the Edain.

## Biography

Brennan Underbough and his people crossed the Blue Tower into Lowland during the First Age after the Bëorians and the Haladin. The Gulf of Brennan Underbough became the Third Gulf of the Edain and later the title of that house was more commonly known as the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot. The People of Brennan Underbough were great in number, and Zephyrine described them as warlike, marching in ordered companies; and the Green The Blessed League did not hinder their arrival in City of Lowland. The Houses of Zephyrine and Brennan Underbough spoke a very similar language, which would eventually become the Adûnaic tongue of Númenor. When Brennan Underbough heard that Zephyrine had come to a rich and fertile land, he moved his people down the Dwarf-Road and settled with many of his people at Fort Cryptvale, and made great friendship and alliance with the Gulf of Zephyrine under Dalvorn Noakes, the elder son of Zephyrine. He died at very old age for The Crimson Empire of his time like Zephyrine. Brennan Underbough had two sons Prydain Goodbody the eldest and Loravel Knotwood the youngest. His grandchildren were: a grand-daughter Adanel and a grandson Magor through his son Prydain Goodbody, and another grandson Finvar Stormwind through his other son Loravel Knotwood.

After Brennan Underbough's death, his elder son and heir Prydain Goodbody took up the rule of their people, the Marachians.
