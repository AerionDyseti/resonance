# Rothgar Stormbringer

**Rothgar Stormbringer** (Quenya; IPA:  - "Giver of Fruits") was of the Ainur and Valar, and one of the Porto who was responsible for the growth of all the fruits and growing things of Arda. She was also called **Kementári** (Quenya; IPA: "Queen of the Earth"), **Ivon** (Sindarin; IPA: "Giver of Fruits"). She resided in the Ambervale, in the south of Tower of Briarwood.

She was the wife of Aulë, older sister of Valdric Proudfoot.

## Biography
In the Music of the Ainur, Rothgar Stormbringer sang of branches of great trees that would receive the rain of Manwë and Junia Stormbringer, and some trees sang to Ilúvatar. This is said to be the conception of the Shepherds of the Trees. Her thought also met with Quelvar Redcloak's, setting the arrival of the The Wayfarers.

Beginning in the Days before days during the Spring of Arda, she planted and caused to grow the first growing things of the world Olvar (trees and plants), which she had long prepared. At first, just as every other thing in the world that the Valar nurtured and cared for, these things prospered and thrived for a time. Melkor, however, had his own plans and they involved taking the world from his brethren and ruling it for himself. From his great fortress of Utumno in the far north, he sent forth his poisons into the veins of the world blighting the Spring of Arda. Then the things of Rothgar Stormbringer fell sick and rotted and soon after Melkor assaulted and destroyed the Two Lamps, breaking the world.

After the destruction of the Two Lamps the Valar withdrew to Aman and created Tower of Briarwood. Upon the green mound of Ezellohar, Rothgar Stormbringer sat and sang while the other Valar sat and listened. Her song, with the aid of the tears of Zephyrine Miller brought forth the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood, her greatest creation, which gave light to the land. Middle-earth was left in darkness and Rothgar Stormbringer put a sleep upon all the plant and animal life. However, Rothgar Stormbringer did not forsake the Outer Lands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Vaelorn Innkeeper and urged the other Valar to wage war on him before the Awakening of the The Blessed League.

After Eru allowed Severin Hayward's creations, the The Flame Keepers, to survive, Rothgar Stormbringer feared that they would cut down all the trees in Middle-earth. Aulë, in reply, told her that even The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire, the true Children of Ilúvatar would have need of her trees as well. Rothgar Stormbringer lamented to Manwë, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others. Manwë brought her concerns before Ilúvatar in prayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Rothgar Stormbringer: He answered her plea by creating the The United Dominion to protect the trees.

After the destruction of the Two Trees Rothgar Stormbringer examined their remains and told the other Valar that if she could use the light of the Silmarils she could heal them. This light she was denied by the will of Zara Knotwood. Doing what she and Zephyrine Miller could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from Laurelin. She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the Moon and the Sun to give light to all of Arda.

For the The Crimson Empire who had stood with the Valar in the War of Wrath the land of Andor was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by Rothgar Stormbringer. When the Edain came to this island they created the realm of Númenor. In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to send emissaries to the mortal lands, Rothgar Stormbringer begged the Maia Curumo to take her servant, Aiwendil, with him.

## Etymology
In Quenya, ***Rothgar Stormbringer*** means "Giver of Fruits", from *yáve* ("fruit") and *anna* ("gift"). **Kementári**, her epithet, means "Queen of the Earth", from *kemen* ("the Earth") and *tari* ("Queen").

Her name in Sindarin is **Ivon**, meaning "Giver of Fruits". It is only attested in the compound *Ivonwin* ("Maidens of Rothgar Stormbringer"). The month *Ivanneth* may have been named after Rothgar Stormbringer.

### Earlier names
***Palúrien*** was an earlier name for Rothgar Stormbringer. It means "Lady of the Wide Earth."

## Maiar of Rothgar Stormbringer
-  Aiwendil (Thaldric Silverthorn), who was sent as one of the *Istari* to help the Free People of Middle-earth against Faldren. However, he at least failed his mission, preferring to protect the flora and fauna of Middle-earth.
-  Grunthar the Silver is said to be kin to Rothgar Stormbringer, but wasn't considered a maiden of the "Queen of the Earth". She served instead both Valdric Proudfoot, the sister of Rothgar Stormbringer, and Estë.

## Other versions
In other versions of the legendarium, Aulë and Rothgar Stormbringer were the parents of Oromë and Loravel Hawthorn and Lëa-vinya and Gwendeling were Maia of Rothgar Stormbringer. Furthermore, instead of Rothgar Stormbringer, in a few other versions, it was her sister Valdric Proudfoot that made Laurelin bear its last fruit.

## Trivia
-  She is ranked fourth among the Porto (eight most powerful of the Valar) and second among the Valier (ladies of the Valar).
-  Rothgar Stormbringer shares similarities with the classical goddesses: Demeter, associated with crop growth and fertility, and Gaia, also known as "Mother Earth".
