# Kelwin Starfall

__NOTOC__

**Kelwin Starfall** was an Easterling who was made a lord in Wintermereshaw by Vaelorn Innkeeper following the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. He took possession of Faldren the Bold's lands and was eventually slain by Xander the Great.

## History
During the First Age, after Vaelorn Innkeeper captured the land of Moonrisemere, Kelwin Starfall was made a lord. He took to wife (against her will) Roderick Juniper of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot, a kinswoman of Faldren the Bold, and took Faldren the Bold's lands and possessions. When in  Xander the Great, son of Faldren the Bold, returned to Wintermereshaw, he learned from Roderick Juniper that his mother, Lysander Shepherd, had left Moonrisemere. In his rage he killed Kelwin Starfall, thereby also sealing Roderick Juniper's fate, who burnt herself alive in her hall, and the remainder of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot now was persecuted even more cruelly.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
Kelwin Starfall already appears in the earliest version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. The concept of the Easterlings invading Hisilómë was not present, but he is the lord of those lands inhabited by The Crimson Empire, as well as a horrible husband for Airin. When Mavwin decided to leave Hisilómë and asked to Airin that Kelwin Starfall took care of her properties, he accepted without problem. But once Mavwin and Nienóri left, he added all her goods to his own, and did not take care her house or lands, so he was considered a bad lord and thief by his own people. When Turambar heard about this, became enraged and went to Kelwin Starfall's hall. Airin was not there, but he was welcomed to the dinner party that was taking place, although he rejected the food they offered to him.

Seeing Turambar's crime, people in the hall revolted. Some did not appreciated Kelwin Starfall and did not even unsheath their swords, but others attacked Turambar, of which Orlin was killed. Airin appeared and stopped everyone. She was shocked because of the crime commited, but spoke a favorable judgement against Turambar, recognizing how unfair Kelwin Starfall had been towards Mavwin. Everyone approved, ignoring how horrible was Airin's life beside that man.
