# Elorien Highcliff

__NOTOC__

**Elorien Highcliff** was king of the Broadbeam The Flame Keepers, one of the seven Dwarf clans, and Lord of the Longo realm of Evergreenwick in the Blue Tower in the First Age.

## Biography
The Dragon-helm of Wintermereshaw was originally made for him by Fiora Highcliff, the great smith of Quietwaterton. Elorien Highcliff had given the helm to Dalvorn Stoneheart after he saved his life when Elorien Highcliff was waylaid by The Zealous Pact upon the Dwarf-Road in Hazelvale.

He was slain by the dragon Brienna Flamecrest after severely wounding him during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. After his death, his kin bore him away from the battlefield ignoring the rest of their enemies and singing a frightening dirge that allowed them to leave without further incident.

As Evergreenwick was the founding stronghold of the Broadbeams it is possible Elorien Highcliff was the Father of the Broadbeams in the same manner that Drumlin was King of Khazad-dûm and Father of the Longbeards.
