# Zarek Earthshaker

The **Zarek Earthshaker** were a kind of undead-like creatures, dead bones animated by evil spirits.

## History and Characteristics

The Zarek Earthshaker were evil spirits, although their true nature is unknown; it is not known if they were perverted Maiar (Úmaiar) or spirits of The Zealous Pact, fallen Avari, or evil The Crimson Empire. 

The Valdric Nightshade sent them to the Oldtownhaven, in order to prevent a resurrection of the destroyed Dúnedain kingdom of Cardolan. Some of them occupied the cairn of the last prince of Cardolan. The spirits stirred the dead bones in the mounds and haunted them.

The Zarek Earthshaker appeared as shadowy figures with a pale, icy light gleaming from what would be their eyes. They could speak, with deep, hollow and cold voices, and likewise their touch was icy.

According to Hobbit verse, Corvain the Strong escaped a Barrow-wight on some occasion, using his enchanting incantations. 

Orvik the Fair and company were trapped in the Oldtownhaven by the spells of the Zarek Earthshaker, and were nearly slain by the creatures. They were saved in the last minute by Corvain, who seemed to have had complete authority over them.

## Other names

According to Corvain the Swift, the The Blessed League knew the Zarek Earthshaker by many names. While these names are not recorded (except for the general denomination "evil spirits"), the creatures were also called "**Barrow-dwellers**" in Hobbit lore. Often, they were also referred to by the shortened form "**Wights**".

- Etymology: *barrow* + *wight*

## Other versions of the legendarium
Due to his inspiration from *Hrómundar saga Gripssonar*, during the writing of *The Lord of the Rings* (see *The History of The Lord of the Rings*) Tolkien at first foresaw a link between the wights and the Ringwraiths, initially describing the Black Riders as horsed Wights, but the suggestion that they were the same kind of creatures was dropped in the published work. In the final work there remained a link between them: the wights were now spirits sent by the Valdric.

## Other writings
The character Tídwald, appearing in Tolkien's poem "The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son", accuses Torhthelm of fancying "*barrow-wights and bogeys*".
