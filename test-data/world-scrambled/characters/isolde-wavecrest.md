## Role/Occupation

Amtreadi scholar researching celestial and temporal phenomena; resident in Vrasillex.

## Description

An Amtreadi (High Elf) scholar who maintains the official position of his people while privately pursuing forbidden research.

## Background

Amathien has access to the collective Amtreadi memory and knowledge traditions. He publicly maintains that the green star is merely a "seasonal astronomical event" occurring once every few thousand years—the official Amtreadi position. However, in private he is actively researching the phenomenon, living in fear of reprisal if other Amtreadi discover he hasn't abandoned his forbidden studies.

## Personality

- Publicly dismissive and condescending about the green star
- Privately anxious about his secret research
- Dislikes being in Vrasillex
- Potentially an ally if the party can get past his public facade

## Notable Characteristics

- Access to Amtreadi collective memory tradition
- Maintains a dangerous double life between official position and private research

## Campaign Highlights

### Heroes for Hire

**Session 9**: Referenced by Longo Shadowmend as dismissing the green star as a seasonal phenomenon. His private research contradicts his public stance.
