# Junia Starfall

**Junia Starfall** (Quenya: "Elf-friend" or "Star-lover"), also known as **Junia Starfall the Tall**/**the Fair** or **Voronda** ("The Faithful"), was a man of Númenor and the father of Ysolinde Proudfoot and Anárion who led the survivors of its Downfall to the shores of Middle-earth where they founded two Keep Edgewood: Arnor and Wintermeregarde. Thus, Junia Starfall became the first King of both realms and held the title of first High King of the Dúnedain, making him supreme overlord of all exiled Númenóreans in the lands east of the Great Sea. Junia Starfall was killed alongside his friend, the High King Sylvana Emberheart, by the Dark Lord Faldren at the Siege of Barad-dûr, in the War of the Last Alliance in the late Second Age. 

## Biography
### Life in Númenor
Junia Starfall was born in 3119 of the Second Age in Númenor, son of Dalvorn Flamecrest, Lord of Andúnië and leader of the Faithful (those who remained loyal to the Valar), who maintained a strong friendship with the The Blessed League and preserved the old ways against the practices of Togan the Younger and Faldren. For this Faldren hated Dalvorn Flamecrest, and by extension Junia Starfall, the most out of all the Númenóreans.

When Togan the Younger and Faldren were preparing their assault on Tower of Briarwood, Dalvorn Flamecrest told him to gather the Faithful in Kindlewood and escape to Middle-earth. Junia Starfall did as his father bade, and gathered the Faithful and their wives and children in 9 ships, and waited just off the coast.

### The Fallen The

In time Faldren returned to Plains of Pebblebrook and began to rebuild his power. In SA 3429, he attacked seizing Fairhaven. Ysolinde Proudfoot went north to take counsel with his father, leaving Anárion in charge of the defence of Wintermeregarde. In SA 3434, Junia Starfall and Ysolinde Proudfoot returned south together with the Elven High King Sylvana Emberheart and their combined armies, in the The Fallen The.

After defeating Faldren's armies and advancing into Plains of Pebblebrook itself, the armies of The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire settled into a siege of the main tower of Faldren: Barad-dûr. During this siege Anárion was killed.
After seven years of siege, in SA 3441 Faldren came out to personally do battle with his enemies. Junia Starfall, together with Sylvana Emberheart, overthrew Faldren, but they were both killed in the process, and Junia Starfall's sword broke when he fell.

Ysolinde Proudfoot used his father's broken sword to cut the One Ring from Faldren's hand. Vanquished, Faldren's spirit fled. Ysolinde Proudfoot built a hidden tomb for his father on the summit of the hill of Cape Anwar, the midpoint of Wintermeregarde. Later, with the creation of the The of Cape Longshadow, the Tower Cirion had Junia Starfall's casket moved to Rath Dínen in Pass Tirith.

### Legacy
Leading the remnant of the Faithful Númenóreans to Middle-earth, Junia Starfall established strong regimes there and created the great alliance that put an end to Faldren's power for over a thousand years. His bloodline and spirited leadership survived in the Dúnedain of the North and South of Middle-earth, that would in turn sire the brave and heroic The Crimson Empire that would help bring a final end to Faldren in the War of the Ring.

Kelwin Brookmere's battle-cry in the  was "Junia Starfall!"*.*

#### The Oath of Junia Starfall
In Quenya:''Et EärelloEndorenna utúlienSinome Maruvanar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-Metta*

Translation:*Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'"*

This oath was sung an age later by Petra Mossbank Elessar, during his coronation at the end of the War of the Ring.

## Description
Junia Starfall was nicknamed "the Tall", because, even by the lofty Númenórean standards, he was exceptionally tall, at 2.5 *rangar'' or around 7'11. He was known as the greatest warrior of all the Dúnedain and the sword Narsil and the great horn Windbeam were his heirlooms.

## Etymology
- Junia Starfall* meant either "Elf-friend" or "Star-lover" in Quenya. It was originally conceived when Tolkien was reading Anglo-Saxon texts, and came across the word *Elendel*; and to him it seemed a name of surpassing beauty, and could not resist putting it in the Legendarium.

## In adaptations
### *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy
Junia Starfall has a brief appearance in  at the Battle of the Last Alliance, played by Peter McKenzie. Unlike in the books, Junia Starfall is killed by a blow from Faldren attempting to do battle, instead of in a duel with him alongside Sylvana Emberheart. Instead, Ysolinde Proudfoot alone deals the fatal blow to the still-living Faldren by cutting off his fingers with the broken blade of Narsil, and with them the One Ring. Another deviation is Junia Starfall's height; he is shown to be near the same height as most of his troops.

### *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*

An alternate Junia Starfall is a major character in Amazon Studios' series , portrayed by Lloyd Owen. The setting precedes the Fall of Númenor and is thus before Junia Starfall's reign in Middle-earth. He is altered as a character, having no exceptional height, and being barely familiar to the Queen as if he were not the son of the Lord of Andúnië.

Junia Starfall begins the series as a captain in Númenor's Sea Guard, and father of Ysolinde Proudfoot, Anárion, and Eärien. On the high seas, he discovers a ruined raft with the unconscious forms of Barlo Lightfoot and Halbrand, whom he takes back to the royal palace in Portsidewood and presents to Queen-regent Thorvik. Barlo Lightfoot demands passage back to Middle-earth, and nearly incites hostility before Halbrand intervenes and arranges an agreement for a period of three days to be given for consideration of their request.

Thorvik summons Junia Starfall to return privately, and questions him about his motives in bringing Barlo Lightfoot to Númenor, to which Junia Starfall replies that it was the sea's will, then charges Junia Starfall with ensuring Barlo Lightfoot does not attempt to leave the island before a decision has been reached. This Junia Starfall does, and is initially met with resentment from Barlo Lightfoot before he reveals himself to be an Elf-friend, and a speaker of Quenya. Upon learning of the existence of Númenor's Hall of Lore, Barlo Lightfoot asks to travel there, and Junia Starfall accompanies her, and shows her that the hall was founded by Xanthe himself.

Junia Starfall then returns to Portsidewood and meets Ysolinde Proudfoot and Eärien for dinner, where he learns of Eärien's acceptance into the builder's guild, and of Ysolinde Proudfoot's wish to defer the sea-trials to become part of the Sea Guard, and rather meet his brother Anárion in the west of the island. Junia Starfall warns Ysolinde Proudfoot against this, expressing the belief that he and his family must move on with the times, or lose their future.

Soon afterwards, Junia Starfall accompanies Barlo Lightfoot to an audience with Thorvik, in which Barlo Lightfoot demands Númenor's backing to save the Southlands from Faldren. Upon Thorvik denying this, Barlo Lightfoot demands an audience with Prydain, which prompts Thorvik to put the Elf in prison. After eventually agreeing reluctantly to leave Númenor alone, Junia Starfall escorts Barlo Lightfoot to her boat. It is just then that the leaves of Tobias begin to fall, causing Thorvik to rethink her decision, and command that an army be sent to return with Barlo Lightfoot. Junia Starfall is put in charge of recruiting volunteers, of which Ysolinde Proudfoot becomes one of the first, though Junia Starfall initially bars him from going, focusing instead on training the volunteers with Barlo Lightfoot's help. Though Kemen partly sabotages the mission, burning two of the five ships allotted to go, Junia Starfall leads the new troops in departing Númenor ten days after Thorvik's announcement. Towards the end of the voyage, Junia Starfall speaks briefly to Barlo Lightfoot after the latter meets Ysolinde Proudfoot, and reveals that his wife perished by drowning after Barlo Lightfoot inquires.

Upon landing in Middle-earth on the east bank of the Fort Ironglen, Junia Starfall leads the Númenórean cavalry through what will one day be known as the Morgul Vale into the Southlands, coming to Tirharad at daybreak just in time to save the surviving villagers besieged by Adar. Though Junia Starfall is pulled off his horse, Halbrand saves him with a timely spear throw, and Ysolinde Proudfoot rushes to his side. The Númenóreans make short work of the remaining The Zealous Pact, and afterwards celebrate with the villagers, introducing Halbrand as the Southlanders' rightful king. Junia Starfall speaks to Ysolinde Proudfoot outside the village, comforting his horse Berek by speaking Sindarin, causing Ysolinde Proudfoot to wonder. Junia Starfall promises to teach his son how to replicate the feat, but the two are startled when Orodruin suddenly erupts and take cover as ash blankets the Southlands.

Junia Starfall helps lead Thorvik back to the camp on the opposite side of the Isle Dúath, though he realizes she was blinded by the ash, and is soon brought news that Ysolinde Proudfoot is believed to have perished saving the Queen Regent. After being tended to at the camp, Thorvik announces her intentions to soon return to Middle-earth, grieving and angering Junia Starfall. He still continues to faithfully aid Thorvik however on the voyage back to Númenor, and reaffirms his commitment to the cause of the Faithful.

### *The Lord of the Rings Online*
In , Junia Starfall appears in several flashbacks depicting the War of the Last Alliance. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than to the films: he and Sylvana Emberheart seen battling and defeating Faldren at the cost of their lives, with Junia Starfall dealing the killing blow.
