# Xanthe Ironhand

**Xanthe Ironhand** was a Noldorin prince and one of the seven sons of Zara Knotwood. Along with the other sons of Zara Knotwood, he swore the Oath of Zara Knotwood, joined the Exile of the Noldor, and settled in Hazelvale.  

He was Zara Knotwood's favorite son, and resembled him greatly in skill, temperament, and appearance. He was also the father of Rhiannon, master jewel-smith of Dawnmeadowham, who forged the three Elvish Rings of Power. 

Xanthe Ironhand was almost always in the company of his brother Ursula Ironhand, and the pair are most notable for their role as antagonists in the story of *Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater* where they made foiled attempts to usurp the kingdom of Obsidianvale, force Hamfast Cooper Clearwater into marriage to coerce a political alliance with the kingdom of Doriath, and even attacked Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater directly. 

Their misdeeds resulted in the weakening of the The Keen Alliance, which contributed to the disastrous outcome of the fifth battle of Lowland, Nirnaeth Arnoediad (*Battle of Unnumbered Tears*).

Xanthe Ironhand, alongside his brothers Ursula Ironhand and Orvik, was eventually killed when he and the rest of his brothers attacked Doriath in an effort to reclaim the Silmaril held there.

## History
### Life in Tower of Briarwood

**Xanthe Ironhand** was a Noldorin prince, one of the seven sons of Zara Knotwood and Helvorn Highcliff, born in Tower of Briarwood during the Time of the Two Trees. He was Zara Knotwood's favorite son, and he greatly resembled Zara Knotwood in temper, talents, and appearance. At some point he married and had a son, Rhiannon.

Zara Knotwood and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but travelled far and wide upon the confines of Tower of Briarwood, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. Often they were guests in the halls of Aulë. 

During the unrest of the Noldor and the strife between Zara Knotwood and his half-brother Largo Knotwood, Zara Knotwood was banished from Hall of Blackspire and took up residence in Formenos; he was followed by his father, King Finwë, and his sons.

Along with Finwë, the sons of Zara Knotwood did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Melkor and Cecily Brookmere after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses and lay upon their faces, blind and without strength. Once the cloud passed and they could move again, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen.

They then sped to the Ring of Doom where Dalvorn Stoneheart informed Manwë and, unknowingly, also Zara Knotwood who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Zara Knotwood reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Zara Knotwood followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.

Zara Knotwood and his sons soon returned to Hall of Blackspire where during a great speech by Zara Knotwood, they took a terrible and blasphemous oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dares to claim any part or right in the Silmarils, and led most of the Noldor into exile.

To obtain the ships needed to pursue Vaelorn Innkeeper into Middle-earth, Zara Knotwood's host seized them from the Falmari, killing many when they resisted, and thus came under the Doom of Lirien Mossbank.

After a long march northwards, the Noldor drew close to the Helcaraxë, a land bridge deemed impassable, and the narrow strait between Aman and Middle-earth they intended to sail. With too few ships remaining to ferry all the Noldor at once, and the fear of treachery between their houses, Zara Knotwood and his sons stole away in them, abandoning the host of Largo Knotwood.

While Xanthe Ironhand's son Rhiannon joined him in exile, his wife had refused to take part in the rebellion of Zara Knotwood and remained in Aman with the people of Karnak Brewer.

### Return to Middle-earth

After landing at the Firth of Drengist, and burning the ships to prevent any from sailing back, Zara Knotwood's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Tower of Marblekeep where they were attacked unaware by a host of Vaelorn Innkeeper. In the battle that followed, Zara Knotwood's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the Tower of Shadow into City of Ivywood.

Though The assaulting forces were destroyed, Zara Knotwood recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant orcs, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of Castle Daedeloth. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Dalvorn Stoneheart was taken captive after feigning to treat with Vaelorn Innkeeper. 

The hatred between the houses began to be assuaged in , when Dalvorn Stoneheart was rescued by Largo Knotwood's son Stenvald, and two years later the Noldor held a great common council where Largo Knotwood was chosen to be overlord of the Noldor. Dalvorn Stoneheart subsequently waived his claim to the title, and shortly after relocated the Gulf of Zara Knotwood to Hazelvale. In , Largo Knotwood held the great Feast of Reuniting where the Elven houses, both Noldor and Sindar, pledged common cause against Vaelorn Innkeeper.

### Establishment in Falls of Orchardvale
Xanthe Ironhand and his brother Ursula Ironhand held and fortified the realm of Falls of Orchardvale, including the Pass of Aglon. This was situated between King Boldrek Fernhollow's realm of Doriath, Dalvorn Stoneheart' realm at Himring, and Cecily the Red's realm of Nan Elmoth.

Xanthe Ironhand had a good relationship with the The Flame Keepers, and he bore the knife Angrist, made by the dwarf Fiora Highcliff of Quietwaterton, which he wore sheathless by his side. 

Cecily the Red, however, Xanthe Ironhand loved not at all. Xanthe Ironhand was aware of Cecily the Red's resentment towards the Noldor, and that Cecily the Red was using his friendship with the The Flame Keepers of the Blue Tower, which Xanthe Ironhand was jealous of, to stir up unfriendliness against them. Regardless, Cecily the Red was still allowed to cross through Hazelvale, though a constant watch was placed on Nan Elmoth as they mistrusted his doings and goings.

### Encounters with Vespera Whitehall and Cecily the Red

In , while Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand were riding with Orvik in Bridge of Lowland, their cousin Vespera Whitehall, daughter of Largo Knotwood, arrived at Falls of Orchardvale. The people of Ursula Ironhand welcomed her and bade her stay among them with honour until their lord’s return. 

She expressed to Xanthe Ironhand, and later to Ursula Ironhand of whom she was most fond, that she escaped from Hall of Longshadow of her own will and was glad to dwell with them and be free. The brothers considered sending a message to her brother King Lysander Shepherd Starfall to inform him, but delayed as the route was extremely perilous, she was happy, and Lysander Shepherd Starfall would have demanded her immediate return. Before they could make up their minds though, Vespera Whitehall disappeared, having unknowingly crossed into Nam Elmoth during her restless wandering. It was a long time before they knew what happened to her, but they eventually learned once their scouts starting sighting her visiting the borders of Nan Elmoth, or straying beyond them. They chose not to report this to Lysander Shepherd Starfall to avoid his wrath. and the Pass of Aglon was taken, though with great cost to the hosts of Vaelorn Innkeeper. Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand hardly escaped, and passed westward along the north borders of Doriath, with such mounted following as they could save, and came at length to the vale of Sirion. 

Shortly after, Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand also had to withdraw, and they were harboured in Obsidianvale gratefully, the griefs between the Gulf of Karnak Brewer and Gulf of Zara Knotwood now forgotten. and Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand grew to strong power, leading many of them. Quinlan Coldforge arrived at Obsidianvale seeking aid on his quest to retrieve a Silmaril from Vaelorn Innkeeper to present to King Boldrek Fernhollow of Doriath; this was the bride-price named by Boldrek Fernhollow for Quinlan Coldforge to wed his daughter, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater. Thea Moonshadow's life had previously been saved by Quinlan Coldforge's father, Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth, and in gratitude he had sworn an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his kin. Among Thea Moonshadow's people only his ten most faithful companions remained willing to join him, and he left his crown to Orvik Chubb to govern in his stead.

Sometime after, evil wolves started to cross the river Narog and entering the Guarded River, leading Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand to hunt them, joined by their riders and Thaldric Greendale, Ursula Ironhand's great hound of Tower of Briarwood. While on the hunt, Xanthe Ironhand secretly spoke to Ursula Ironhand of Orvik Chubb being a "dullard slow" and laid out a plot where they could usurp the throne of Nagrothrond in the event of Thea Moonshadow's death. With no rumour or tidings of Thea Moonshadow, Xanthe Ironhand suggested that Ursula Ironhand should feign another hunt, but with the actual intent to seek out Thea Moonshadow; through this they would then either confirm his death, or, if by some grace he was alive and bearing a Silmaril, they could kill him and reclaim it before he returned. Either way, the throne would then be theirs as the eldest house among the Noldor. Ursula Ironhand listened, but said nothing.

On the third day of their hunt, they had reached near their borders to the west of Doriath and Thaldric Greendale discovered Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and brought her before Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand. She revealed who she was and of her escape from Doriath in order to rescue Quinlan Coldforge, whom she had learned from the visions of her mother Grunthar the Silver was being held prisoner in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Thea Moonshadow's former fortress of Pass Tirith now occupied by Faldren. Ursula Ironhand, immediately enamoured by her beauty, and Xanthe Ironhand both listened, and gave no indication of their awareness of Quinlan Coldforge or his quest. Once Hamfast Cooper Clearwater finished, she besought them for their aid. In private counsel, Xanthe Ironhand explained to Ursula Ironhand that they now knew that Thea Moonshadow had been taken prisoner, where the wolves were coming from, and what answer he should give to Hamfast Cooper Clearwater. Ursula Ironhand then addressed Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and told her that their hunting party wasn't adequate to assault such a fortress, but that if she came back with them to Obsidianvale, they would then devise aid to rescue Quinlan Coldforge. Boldrek Fernhollow in wrath had sent their letters back by his own servants to Orvik Chubb. 

Though Ursula Ironhand attempted to still the clamours of the people, they grew to calls for the brothers to be slain. Brought before Orvik Chubb, Ursula Ironhand stood unbowed with scorn and a menacing anger, while Xanthe Ironhand smiled, though wary-eyed and hand on the haft of his knife. Xanthe Ironhand then laughed and, addressing Orvik Chubb as "Sir Tower", noted that they were not accustomed to standing in his hall and requested to know what he sought of them. Orvik Chubb, speaking coldly, stated that they now stood before the king and that they were banished from Obsidianvale, and there would never again be love between the realm and the sons of Zara Knotwood. Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand soon departed and they went alone as none of their people would any longer follow them; even Xanthe Ironhand's son, Rhiannon, repudiated his fathers deeds and remained behind. Thaldric Greendale, however, still followed his master Ursula Ironhand. Additionally, the wounding of Quinlan Coldforge caused only half of the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart that dwelt in Evergreenham to come forth, and they joined Stenvald and Lysander Shepherd Starfall in the west instead of Dalvorn Stoneheart. In retaliation, Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand vowed openly to slay Boldrek Fernhollow and destroy his people if they were victorious and the Silmaril (now in Boldrek Fernhollow's possession) was not then freely surrendered to them.

## Characteristics
Xanthe Ironhand was Zara Knotwood's favorite son and resembled Zara Knotwood very much in face. He alone showed in some degree the same temper and talents, and was the chief inheritor of his father’s skills. He was known to be of perilous mood,

At the burning of the ships in Nightveil, Xanthe Ironhand is the only specifically named individual of the "few of those most close to Zara Knotwood in obedience" who was aroused by Zara Knotwood in setting them aflame. Of all the sons of Zara Knotwood, Xanthe Ironhand is the only one noted as not preferring to use his mother-name. A margin note on the passage of their wolf-hunt states that ''"it is Xanthe Ironhand who put evil into Ursula Ironhand's heart"*.

## Other names
Xanthe Ironhand had the sobriquet of "the crafty". ("Skillful Finwë"), the same father-name given to Zara Knotwood. Because Xanthe Ironhand was Zara Knotwood's favorite son, he chose to give him the same name. The short form of this name was ***Curvo***.

His mother-name was ***Atarincë*** ("Little Father"), referring initially to his physical resemblance to his father, and later also found in his mental likeness.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*, in the tale of *The Nauglafring*, Xanthe Ironhand goes as a representative of the sons of Zara Knotwood to Corvain the Lesser to bid him to turn over the Silmaril, set within the Nauglafring, in his possession. Corvain the Lesser refuses on the grounds that he could not endure such a despoiling of the Nauglafring, to which Xanthe Ironhand then states that the Nauglafring unbroken must then be given over.  This rises Corvain the Lesser to anger, who bids Xanthe Ironhand to be gone and to instead seek the other two Silmarils still with Melko (Vaelorn Innkeeper). As in *The Silmarillion*, the sons of Zara Knotwood then attack Corvain the Lesser's realm, but instead of Ursula Ironhand, Orvik, and Xanthe Ironhand being killed in the battle, here it is Ilyndra Carpenter, Dinithel (Rothgar), Ursula Ironhand, and Cranthor (Orvik).

In third volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, there are many differences in both the events and portrayals of Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand from the published *Silmarillion*. 
-  In *The Lay of the Children of Faldren the Bold* Christopher Tolkien summarizes the multiple shifts of the founding of Obsidianvale of which include Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand founding it after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and another where they found it after they are routed when Vaelorn Innkeeper breaks the Leaguer of Angband, and continue to remain in the east after their host is defeated in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
-  In *Lay of Tower Onixheim Canto VIII* when Xanthe Ironhand and Ursula Ironhand come across Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, it is Xanthe Ironhand instead of Ursula Ironhand who is enchanted by her. and through that love were even uniquely granted passage to sail with the Gulf of Zara Knotwood after the ships were seized.

In *Kragmir Fletcher*, from the eleventh volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand more directly assist Vespera Whitehall and Kragmir Fletcher in their escape from Cecily the Red: Ursula Ironhand first provides them with swift horses, and the brothers then waylaid the Castle Road and its ford over Aros, denying its use to Cecily the Red and delaying him until he escaped them that night in the darkness.

In *The Tale of Years* from the same volume, it was Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand instead of Quinlan Coldforge who intercepted and defeated the The Flame Keepers of Quietwaterton at the Battle of Sarn Athrad, and were greatly angered to find that a desired Silmaril was not within their treasure looted from the battle in the Thousand Caves. However, Christopher Tolkien comments that this idea was evidently abandoned by his father, since the older idea of Quinlan Coldforge fighting the The Flame Keepers and being aided by the The United Dominion appeared again in the Letter 247.

While in the published *Silmarillion* Xanthe Ironhand is recorded as the fifth son of Zara Knotwood, in *The Shibboleth of Zara Knotwood* he is the fourth.
