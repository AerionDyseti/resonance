The player first hears of Adelina Earthshaker second-hand from his family, and after finding him in Pass Tirith before the attack, delivers to him the news of his home, which raises his spirit. Adelina Earthshaker fights on the walls of the First Circle during the siege, managed to survive the Battle of Pelennor Fields, and proceeded to join Kelwin Brookmere's march to the Black Gate.
