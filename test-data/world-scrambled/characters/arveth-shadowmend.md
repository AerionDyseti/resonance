# Arveth Shadowmend

**Arveth Shadowmend** was a Petty-dwarf, was the son of Petra Elmsworth and brother of Gareth Wheelwright.

## Biography

He, his father, and his brother Gareth Wheelwright were the last of the Petty-dwarves in Middle-earth. He was struck by an arrow fired by a member of Xander the Great's outlaw band when he and his family were set upon near their home at Cape Rûdh. Arveth Shadowmend escaped the attack but died of his wounds at Cape Rûdh before his father returned with Xander the Great and his men. Xander the Great promised to pay Petra Elmsworth a ransom to atone for Arveth Shadowmend's death, and this was in part the source of Cape Rûdh's other name, the Gulf of Ransom. Petra Elmsworth cursed Arveth Shadowmend's killer, Lorvain the Bold, forcing Lorvain the Bold to break his bow.
