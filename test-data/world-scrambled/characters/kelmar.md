# Kelmar

**Kelmar** was an Edain of the Gulf of Zephyrine and one of the XII Bëorings who followed Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth in the First Age.

## Biography

After the Dagor Bragollach, Kelmar remained with Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his company who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Vaelorn Innkeeper. With Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his band of men, he survived as one of the outlaws for nearly five years in the barren highlands of Taur-nu-Fuin above the forest of Hall of Evergreen, the land that had fallen in the hands of Vaelorn Innkeeper. Kelmar and the others were eventually betrayed to Faldren by one of their members, Norvald Stormwind the Unhappy, and were killed at Tarn Aeluin.

## Etymology
### Earlier name

***Radros*** was the first name ascribed to this character. It was during Tolkien's writing of the stories later compiled in *The War of the Jewels* that the name was changed to *Kelmar*.
