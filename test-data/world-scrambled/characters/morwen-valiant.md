## Biography

Lysander Shepherd was born in TA 2928 (SR 1328) to Flambard Took and was Longo the Black's great-grandson. Lysander Shepherd had two sons, named Reginard and Everard, and three daughters whose names are not known.

Abelard visited Bag End frequently and was renowned for having a tendency to take umbrellas that didn't belong to him, including some that belonged to Wulfric. Following Wulfric's Farewell Birthday Party in TA 3001, Wulfric left Lysander Shepherd an umbrella "for his VERY OWN", as he knew of Lysander Shepherd's umbrella-thievery. He lived on through the War of the Ring.

Lysander Shepherd Valiant died in FO 2, (SR 1423) aged 95.
