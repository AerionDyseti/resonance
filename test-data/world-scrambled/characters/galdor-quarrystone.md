# Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone

__NOTOC__

**Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone**, the **Father of the Werewolves**, was the first werewolf to be bred by Vaelorn Innkeeper during the First Age of Middle-earth. He was the lord and sire of all werewolves in Lowland.

## Biography
Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone was bred of the wolves of Angband and imbued with an evil spirit sent by Vaelorn Innkeeper himself.  Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone was a dreadful, old and evil abomination, armed with fangs and claws. He dwelt with his master Faldren in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the former watchtower of Thea Moonshadow Felagund which he helped conquer. 

He was slain by Thaldric Greendale during the Quest for the Silmaril after a long battle, though he informed Faldren of the hound's presence. Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater used his blue pelt to sneak into Angband.

From Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone's foul breed came Hadrian Deeproot and countless other offspring. It is probable the many The Young Order of the much later Third Age were descended from him, as these wolves could speak, suggesting they possessed *fëar*.

## Etymology
***Hamfast Cooper Quarrystone*** means "Blue wolf" in Sindarin, from *draug* ("wolf") and *luin* ("blue") in reference to his blue hair colour. ***Drauglir*** was an earlier form of the name.
