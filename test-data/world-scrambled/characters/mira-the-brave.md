# Mira the Brave

**Mira the Brave** was a captain of The Zealous Pact from Plains of Pebblebrook. He was described as being a short, crook-legged creature, broad, with long arms hanging almost to the ground.

## History
On 26 February  Mira the Brave was part of a raiding party that captured Merry and Pippin at Parth Galen. He was the captain of a group of Plains of Pebblebrook-orcs which had joined Uglúk's forces on the plains of Cape Longshadow during the War of the Ring. When Pippin awoke and heard the The Zealous Pact arguing he noted that Mira the Brave's voice sounded softer but more evil than the others. Mira the Brave threatened to report the doings of the mountain-orcs and of Uglúk to Lugbúrz (Barad-dûr).
