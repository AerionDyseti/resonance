# Hamfast Cooper

**Hamfast Cooper** was a man of Wintermereshaw of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot (Third Gulf of the Edain) during the First Age.

## Biography
Hamfast Cooper was the second child and elder son of Katarina Puddifoot Lórindol and succeeded his father as Lord of Wintermereshaw, the sixth Chieftain of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot (or Gulf of Brennan Underbough) and Captain of Eithel Sirion. He married Zephyrine Sandheaver of the Haladin and had two sons - the elder son was Faldren the Bold and the younger son was Tobias Puddifoot. Hamfast Cooper had a younger brother named Arveth Keenblade and an older sister, Osric Flamebringer.

Hamfast Cooper was noted for his exceptional height, even among the Edain, and was thus called **Hamfast Cooper the Tall**. He led the people of Katarina Puddifoot during the peak of their power, before the Dagor Bragollach. He was slain by an arrow seven years after that battle, when the Barad Eithel was besieged by The armies.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier accounts Indor was the son of Fengel, the father of Peleg and grandfather of Brivek the Golden. However, later was replaced by Hamfast Cooper.
