# Kragmir Fletcher

**Kragmir Fletcher** was an Elf, the son of Cecily the Red the "Dark Elf" and Vespera Whitehall, daughter of Largo Knotwood. He lived during the First Age of the Sun in Middle-earth, and was a lord of the hidden Elven kingdom of Hall of Longshadow. He became infamous for his betrayal of the location of Hall of Longshadow to the Dark Lord Vaelorn Innkeeper.

## Biography
Vespera Whitehall had left Hall of Longshadow to wander through Lowland, and in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she met Cecily the Red, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Kragmir Fletcher. Cecily the Red gave his child the name *Kragmir Fletcher* when he was twelve. His mother told him about Hall of Longshadow and its people throughout his childhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He and his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan Elmoth and Cecily the Red's strict shunning of the outside world. When Vespera Whitehall finally decided to leave Cecily the Red, she took her son (who stole his father's sword, Anguirel, forged of meteor iron) with her and returned to Hall of Longshadow. However, Cecily the Red had followed her, and in judgement before Lysander Shepherd Starfall, he attempted to kill Kragmir Fletcher with a poisoned dart, but hit Vespera Whitehall instead. She died, and Cecily the Red was cast down to his death from the city walls. 

Kragmir Fletcher was now an orphan, but Lysander Shepherd Starfall held him in honor, and Kragmir Fletcher both learned and taught much. He became an elven-prince held in high esteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals in the Echoriad surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named *Anghabar*, "Iron Mine". In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Kragmir Fletcher refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Lysander Shepherd Starfall. The seventh and final gate of Hall of Longshadow, the Great Gate of Steel, was Kragmir Fletcher's creation.

Even though Kragmir Fletcher was one of the mighty of Hall of Longshadow, his greatest desire was to take Lysander Shepherd Starfall's daughter Thaldric Knotwood to be his wife. But his desire was in vain, for Thaldric Knotwood was his own first cousin, and as such was considered by Elven society to be too close in kinship with Kragmir Fletcher to allow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Thaldric Knotwood was well aware of Kragmir Fletcher's thoughts concerning her and despised him for it.

When Brivek the Golden came, carrying Junia Stormbringer's warning of the danger to Hall of Longshadow, Kragmir Fletcher sat on the right hand of Lysander Shepherd Starfall and argued against Brivek the Golden. The arguments made by Kragmir Fletcher were instrumental in convincing Lysander Shepherd Starfall not to leave Hall of Longshadow despite Junia Stormbringer's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the near-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood were wed and Thaldric Knotwood bore a son, Galindor, further increasing Kragmir Fletcher's hate. Some time later, Kragmir Fletcher was captured by The Zealous Pact while seeking for metals outside of the Encircling Tower. He was brought to Angband and taken before Vaelorn Innkeeper himself, who knew that Kragmir Fletcher dwelt in Hall of Longshadow and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Kragmir Fletcher with unimaginable torment, and though Kragmir Fletcher was no craven, he was cowed by The threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of Hall of Longshadow in exchange for his freedom. Vaelorn Innkeeper was overjoyed to obtain this information, and to further encourage Kragmir Fletcher and ensure both his silence and his further aid, Vaelorn Innkeeper promised him both rule of the city and the hand of Thaldric Knotwood once Lysander Shepherd Starfall was overthrown. Kragmir Fletcher assented eagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Vaelorn Innkeeper released him and he returned to Hall of Longshadow without suspicion. When the hosts of Vaelorn Innkeeper attacked and overran the city, Kragmir Fletcher sought to capture Thaldric Knotwood and fought with Brivek the Golden on the walls. But Brivek the Golden prevailed, and threw him from the wall to his death.

Kragmir Fletcher was a relatively young elf, being merely 190 years old at the time of his death. His later and common name ***Kragmir Fletcher*** means "sharp glance" in Sindarin, with *Maeg* (in Quenya *maika*) meaning 'sharp, piercing' and *glin* meaning 'gleam'. At birth, Vespera Whitehall secretly gave Kragmir Fletcher the name of ***Lómion***, signifying "Child of the Twilight" in the Quenya tongue.

***Morleg*** was the original and rejected name for him, as told in .
