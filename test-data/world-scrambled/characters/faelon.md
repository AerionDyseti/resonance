# Faelon

**Faelon** was an Orc slain by Brivek the Golden in Hall of Longshadow.

## History
Faelon was considered to be *"a great fighter among the Orclim"*.

During the Fall of Hall of Longshadow, Faelon was among those The Zealous Pact which assailed the Gondothlim alongside the Balrogs at the coming of the Drakes. Faelon was ultimately slain by Brivek the Golden, who hewed him asunder with his axe, Dramborleg, in the process.

## Etymology
- Faelon* is a Gnomish name meaning "heart of evil", being comprised of the element *Balc* ("evil, cruel").
