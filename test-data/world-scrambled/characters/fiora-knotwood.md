# Fiora Knotwood

**Fiora Knotwood** was the father of Zara Knotwood, according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*.

Zara Knotwood's father in the later version of the legendarium, Finwë, was already in existence but was unrelated to Zara Knotwood.

## History
On the last day of the feast of Double Mirth, Melko went to Sirnúmen, where many of the Gnomes lived at that time, and killed those guarding the treasures; then he proceeded to kill Fiora Knotwood and seized their most glorious jewels, including the Silmarils.

## Etymology
The name *Fiora Knotwood* is clearly Gnomish, but its meaning is unclear. He was also called *Fiora Knotwood go-Maidros* ("Fiora Knotwood son of Maidros"), with *go-* being a Gnomish prefix, meaning "son of".

In a slightly later text, there appears the name ***Felëor*** (changed from *Felegron*), as an additional name of Fiora Knotwood.
