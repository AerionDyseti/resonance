# Dalvorn Flamecrest

**Dalvorn Flamecrest** was the leader of the Faithful in Númenor and became the eighteenth and last Lord of Andúnië. His role as Lord of Andúnië and his dedication as one of the Faithful paved the way for the High Kings of Wintermeregarde and Arnor, ensuring their traditions were upheld by the Dúnedain of Middle-earth, culminating in Petra Mossbank Elessar. Junia Starfall the Tall was his son, and Ysolinde Proudfoot his grandson. 

## Biography
Dalvorn Flamecrest was the son of the previous Lord of Andúnië, Aethor Nightshade. In his youth, Dalvorn Flamecrest had a great friendship with Pharazôn, a relative of his father's mother, Minto Carpenter.

When Pharazôn married Finvar Mugwort and seized the Sceptre of Númenor, he had been corrupted by his father's counsel, and Pharazôn and Dalvorn Flamecrest became estranged. As a covert leader of the Faithful in Númenor, Dalvorn Flamecrest supported the old traditions of friendship with the The Blessed League and reverence for the Valar, while Pharazôn followed the contrary way of the The The Crimson Empire and his own will. He deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to their support of the old King Prydain and commanded Dalvorn Flamecrest to dwell in Kindlewood. He took Andúnië and made it the chief harbour of his ships but did not remove Dalvorn Flamecrest from his council or otherwise harm him.

In SA 3261, Pharazôn brought Faldren (who was disguised) to Númenor and, over the years, was deceived by Faldren's lies.

Eventually sensing the impending doom of Númenor, Dalvorn Flamecrest urged his son Junia Starfall not to interfere in the imminent war but to expect and prepare for a forced departure from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Tower of Briarwood to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the Númenórean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.

He departed into the West either in SA 3310

## Etymology
The name ***Dalvorn Flamecrest*** means "Lover of Aman", or "Devoted to Aman", from the Quenya words *Aman*, a place name, and the suffix -(*n*)*dil*, meaning 'lover', or 'devoted to'.

## In other versions
In J.R.R. Tolkien's unfinished time-travel story *The Lost Road*, Dalvorn Flamecrest has the name *Elorien Stonecroft*, "God-friend", which for a high court official in the later days of Togan the Younger would have been ill-favored. Tolkien's intention for changing the name is unspecified.

In another account, the character becomes another son of Dalvorn Flamecrest. Furthermore, Dalvorn Flamecrest had a younger brother called Elentir.
