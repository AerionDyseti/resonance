## Role/Occupation

Conductor of the Frostbound Phalanx (The Phalanx of the Wild); former Mountain Elf champion

## Description

The spirit of the former Mountain Elf champion, now a Revenant riding a Skeletal Dragon. She leads a hunting pack of Winter Wights and Frost Ghouls through a roaming blizzard of ice, shattered bone, and howling wind that patrols the wilderness between the castle's locations.

## Background

Polo was not just a loyal champion; she was **Nilorin's first and most devout convert**. She willingly accepted undeath, believing it was the path of a true champion—eternal service to the Starfather through Nilorin's "New The."

Her Revenant nature creates a tragic paradox: her "honor" is bound to Nilorin's heretical faith, but her original honor (protecting the living) is what twists her spirit. She hunts the wilderness not to simply kill, but to gather living Mountain Elf survivors for "ascension"—she sees them as "lost lambs" who refuse the Starfather's gift.

## Zealot Status

**Polo is a die-hard zealot and true believer.** Unlike some of the other Conductors who are bound against their will or serve pragmatically, Polo genuinely believes in Nilorin's vision of undeath as holy ascension. She cannot be bribed or reasoned with through normal means.

## Goals/Motivations

- Hunt and "gather" the living Mountain Elf survivors for ascension
- Serve the Starfather through eternal vigilance
- Prove her devotion through endless service

## Relationships

- **Queen Nilorin** — Liege and spiritual leader; Polo was her first convert
- **The Skeletal Dragon** — Fort
- **Mountain Elf Survivors** — Sees them as "lost lambs" to be saved through ascension
- **The Frostbound Phalanx** — Her hunting pack of Winter Wights and Frost Ghouls

## Potential Social Solution

The only "social" solution is a **formal challenge to single combat**. Polo, bound by her original sense of honor, will command her Phalanx and dragon to stand down if a PC declares a 1-on-1 duel.

A theological accusation (DC 25 Persuasion or History) can invoke her name and past, forcing her to confront the lie she is built on: "You are a heretic, Polo! You, who swore to defend the living, now drag them to a false god! You have betrayed the Starfather!" This causes her to falter, giving the party advantage as her faith cracks.

If a PC defeats her in single combat (she yields at 10% HP), her spirit is freed and the Phalanx dissipates.

## Combat Notes

- The blizzard itself is difficult terrain and causes cold damage per round
- The Dragon provides air support while Polo and her legion attack on the ground
- Mobile, chaotic battle across the frozen wilderness

## Rewards

- Defeating Polo grants the **Cycle Token**: Once, keep an ally at 1 HP (bearer drops to 1 HP); exhaustion 1 at session end

## Notes

- The party spotted Polo and her dragon during reconnaissance but bypassed them with exceptional stealth
- The Frostbound Phalanx is not in a fixed location—it roams the wilderness
- One of the four black binding scrolls is likely linked to her as a phalanx captain
