**Ponto Shadowend** was an Edain Man of the Gulf of Zephyrine.

## Biography
Ponto Shadowend was the first child and only son of Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth, and the brother of Naeris and Beril, his sisters. He eventually became the second Lord of Haunthollowford. Ponto Shadowend was the father of five children: Bregil, his eldest child and first daughter, Hirwen, his second child and second daughter, Willa Diggle  his third child and elder son, Gilwen, his fourth child and third daughter, and Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth his last child and youngest son.

Ponto Shadowend was most likely killed during the Dagor Bragollach. The Bow of Ponto Shadowend became a relic of the First Age and was preserved in Númenor until the Downfall.

The grandchildren of Ponto Shadowend were: Katarina (son of Arachon) and his sister Beldis through his first daughter Bregil; Beleth* *and her brothers, Zaldric Fernhollow and Isolde Juniper through his elder son Willa Diggle, and Quinlan Coldforge One-handed through his younger son Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth.
