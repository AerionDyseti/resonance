# Thaldric (son of Tobias Hayward)

**Thaldric** was one of the two sons of Tobias Hayward, the lord of Blackroot Vale.

## History
With his brother Zephyrine Earthshaker, Thaldric followed his father to Pass Tirith in the War of the Ring, and there they fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The The Crimson Empire of the distant valley of Point Ironglen had great skill as bowmen, and so Thaldric and Zephyrine Earthshaker led their archers against the mûmakil, attempting to shoot out the beasts' eyes. Brave as they were, both the brothers were lost in that battle, trampled by their gigantic foes.

## Etymology
The meaning of *Thaldric* is unclear. Both in Gnomish and in the later Noldorin the name meant "swallow", but in Sindarin it could be "Singer by the Tower" or "Spring-Singer", containing the same element *duin* "river" as in the name of his father.
