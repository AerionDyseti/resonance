# Grunthar the Silver

**Grunthar the Silver** "**the Maia**" was a Maia of Rothgar Stormbringer, wife of King Elu Boldrek Fernhollow, Queen of Doriath, and mother of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater Tinúviel. Grunthar the Silver was the fourth greatest and one of the most powerful of the Maiar. In Middle-earth, she was unsurpassed in both wisdom, beauty, and magical singing.

## Biography
Before she came to Middle-earth, Grunthar the Silver served both Valdric Proudfoot and Estë, and dwelt in Lórien tending the trees that grew in the Gardens of Irmo. Among all of her people none were wiser (with the exception of Ilmarë, Elvrik Proudfoot, Olórin and Corwin Greendale), more beautiful, or more skilled in singing enchanting songs than Grunthar the Silver. She loved the deep shadows of the great trees. When the light of the Two Trees would mingle Grunthar the Silver would sing and the Valar would stop their work and listen. Nightingales went with her wherever she went, and she taught them their song. Of all the Valar she was most akin to Rothgar Stormbringer. When the The Blessed League awoke on the shore of Bridge of Limestone she departed from Tower of Briarwood and went to Middle-earth, where she filled its silence with her singing and the singing of her birds. During this time, she was the chief of the Guardians.

While in the forest of Nan Elmoth she met and fell in love with the Elven-king Elu Boldrek Fernhollow, and later she ruled the kingdom of Doriath by his side. For thousands of years, she used her powers to guard and defend the kingdom with a protection spell called the Girdle of Grunthar the Silver, but she predicted that one person would one day breach this defense. The Girdle functioned to bewilder any who attempted to enter Doriath, and was so potent that even Cecily Brookmere was unable to breach it. She and her husband had a child, a daughter named Hamfast Cooper Clearwater. During her stay in Doriath she became a friend and mentor of Barlo Lightfoot. Grunthar the Silver wanted to know the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Barlo Lightfoot only briefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Nightveil. But eventually she and Boldrek Fernhollow learned the truth.

Grunthar the Silver's main line of descent was of the Half-elven, and through her daughter the Maian blood passed to both The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire. When Quinlan Coldforge arrived as foretold, she counseled Boldrek Fernhollow against sending Quinlan Coldforge for a Silmaril, a quest which would eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. A friend of Mankind, she also aided Faldren the Bold's family by hosting Xander the Great in Doriath and later helped Eldris Quicksilver Cúthalion in his search for Xander the Great by giving him Lembas. When Faldren the Bold came to Doriath old and carrying a great grief and misery on him, Grunthar the Silver helped him see through his ills. After Boldrek Fernhollow's death she left Doriath, visiting Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater for a time warning them of the The Flame Keepers treachery, and the curse on the Petra Elmsworth's treasure. Shortly there-after, she went back to Tower of Briarwood, musing upon her sorrows in the gardens of Lórien whence she came.

## Etymology
- Grunthar the Silver* is a Sindarin name, from the Quenya *Melyanna*, of which the roots are *mel* (love) and *anna* (gift). The name means "dear gift." Earlier versions of Grunthar the Silver's name were **Gwenniel **or **Gwenethlin**. Her rare title-name, ***Tóril***, meant "queen."

## Other versions
In some of J.R.R. Tolkien's earliest tales, Grunthar the Silver is a sprite or twilight spirit named **Tindriel**, then **Wendelin**, who served Palúrien. Tinwelint (later Boldrek Fernhollow) finds her lonely in a glade of Hisilómë. She is **Gwendeling** or **Gwenniel** in "The Tale of Tinúviel" (written in 1917), found in the woods listening to the nightingales by Tinwelint, and running away when he first approaches her. This encounter foreshadowed Quinlan Coldforge's first meeting of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, whom he would call "Nightingale", in the final versions of their own tale. Gwendeling marries Tinwelint later, and together they rule Artanor (later Doriath).

Tolkien once chose Tinfang to be Wendelin's son, but dropped the idea.

Gwendeling would be more powerful as Grunthar the Silver the Maia in later stages of Tolkien's mythology; the Maiar were not conceived of until some years after "The Tale of Tinúviel" was written.
