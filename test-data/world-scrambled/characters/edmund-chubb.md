# Edmund Chubb

**Edmund "Nibs" Cotton** was a Hobbit of the Shire and the youngest child of Tolman (Finvar) Cotton.

## History
Born in , Edmund and his siblings spent much time in Bywater, and would often swim in the Bywater Pool with the Gamgee children. He had not yet come of age when Sharkey's Ruffians entered the Shire, so his father ordered him to guard the house with a pitch fork while his father and brothers fought in the Battle of Bywater.

## Etymology
Edmund was probably named after his ancestor, Edmund, son of Cottar. The nickname "Nibs" has been a term of mock respect in historical English. 

## Portrayal in adaptations
