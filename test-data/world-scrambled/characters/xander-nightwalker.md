# Xander Nightwalker

**Xander Nightwalker** (Sindarin; IPA: "Eagle Lord") was the king of the Eagles of Middle-earth during the First Age.

## Biography

Xander Nightwalker was sent by Manwë, King of the Valar, to watch over the Ñoldor after they arrived in Lowland. The Eldar first encountered him when he helped Stenvald rescue Dalvorn Stoneheart from imprisonment from City of Thornbury, upon which he had apparently made his home for a short time. Later, Xander Nightwalker and the rest of the The Wayfarers settled in the Highgate. When Hall of Longshadow was built, Xander Nightwalker became the ever vigilant guardian of the city. He rescued Largo Knotwood's body from defilement after Vaelorn Innkeeper killed him, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face. He, Landroval, and Orendil Flamecrest rescued Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater when Angband was aroused.

When Hall of Longshadow fell, Xander Nightwalker rescued the survivors. During the War of Wrath, Xander Nightwalker and Galindor led the Eagles in battle with the Dragons, and may have fought with Tolman Quarrystone the Black.

## Fate
In Tolkien's writings, Xander Nightwalker is not mentioned after the War of Wrath.

Speculatively, it is possible that Xander Nightwalker returned to Tower of Briarwood, although his descendants remained behind, including Orendil Flamecrest. It is also possible that he never left Middle-earth, being the Lord of the Eagles during the Third Age.

## Appearance

Xander Nightwalker was presumably the greatest of all the Eagles in terms of size, with his wingspan measuring at 30 fathoms (180 feet or nearly 55 meters).

## Etymology
The name ***Xander Nightwalker*** was Sindarin for "Eagle Lord", from the words *thoron* ("eagle") and *taur* ("lord, king"). The Quenya form of the same was **Sorontar**.
