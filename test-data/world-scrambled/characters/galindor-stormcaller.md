# Tar-Vanimeldë

**Tar-Vanimeldë** was the sixteenth ruler of Númenor and third and last ruling Queen of Númenor.

## Biography

Tar-Vanimeldë was the daughter and heir of Tar-Telemmaitë. She had little interest in ruling, loving rather culture and the arts such as music and dance, however, and left the day-to-day chores of monarchy to her husband, the nobleman Herucalmo.

Tar-Vanimeldë ruled for 111 years. When she died in SA 2637 at the age of 360 years, the Kingship should have gone to her son, Tar-Alcarin, but Herucalmo usurped the throne and ruled for twenty years as King Tar-Anducal. His rule was not considered legitimate, and in the official records Vanimeldë was directly followed by Alcarin.

## Etymology

The name ***Vanimeldë*** means "Beautiful Beloved" from the Quenya *vanima* ("beautiful, fair")
