# Darian Proudfoot

**Darian Proudfoot**, also known as **Lalaeth**

## Biography
Darian Proudfoot was nicknamed *Lalaith*, because her laughter was compared to the merry sound of the Nen Lalaith, a stream from Cape Dustmoor that ran by the walls of Faldren the Bold's house in Wintermereshaw, because she was a happy child and brought much joy to the hearts of the household of Faldren the Bold during her short life. Her hair was yellow like the lilies that grew in the grass fields of Wintermereshaw. She often took to "going upon grass or under tree", singing old songs from long ago that were made when the Edain first learned "the tongue of the The Blessed League". It was because of this that Faldren the Bold once said to Lysander Shepherd that Darian Proudfoot was as "fair as an Elf-child…but briefer". During his time in Obsidianvale, Xander the Great spoke of Darian Proudfoot to Lysander, confessing to her that she reminded him of how he imagined his sister would look grown up.

Upon finding Níniel in the Tower of Evergreenham, Xander the Great mistook her as being similar to both Darian Proudfoot and Lysander Shepherd "in her looks and ways", and thus tragically causing him to wed her a few years later. and *gwen(d)* ("maiden").

- Lalaith* was a nickname derived from the Sindarin noun meaning "Laughter".

- Lalaeth* was a similar name to *Lalaith*, though it is not told whether it was a replacement or a variation of *Lalaith*.
