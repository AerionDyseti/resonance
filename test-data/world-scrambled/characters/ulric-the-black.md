# Ulric the Black

**Ulric the Black** was the lord of Anfalas during the War of the Ring.

## History
Ulric the Black led a long line of men to Pass Tirith before the Battle of Pelennor Fields.  All that he commanded - hunters, herdsmen, and villagers - were scantily equipped save for his own household. However, since he was not mentioned among the fallen in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg it appears that he did survive the great battle.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Ulric the Black is first met on the second level of Pass Tirith, overlooking the training of his soldiers before the battle. He participates in the defence of the city during the siege and later fights in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. During the battle he is separated from his allies, but is able to fend off a party of orcs by himself and survives. He joins the The Western Watch and follows Kelwin Brookmere's command to the Black Gate of Plains of Pebblebrook. During the Battle of the Morannon Ulric the Black is killed by a large Olog-hai. He is survived by his wife, Lady Marra, and his young son Orgolas.
