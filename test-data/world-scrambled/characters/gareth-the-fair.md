# Gareth the Fair

**Gareth the Fair I** was the King of Drogon Folk, the son of Polo I and brother of Frór and Grór, known for ruling Erebor, the Tower Ironglen. He was the father of Stenvald Coldforge, whose son was Lorvain.

## Biography
In his early life, Gareth the Fair and his family lived in the dragon-plagued Ered Mithrin. In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by Cold-drakes, his father Polo I and younger brother Frór were both slain at their gates by a great Cold-drake, and Gareth the Fair inherited the kingship. He and his youngest brother Grór resolved to divide their folk: Gareth the Fair led a small portion of Drogon Folk to recolonize Erebor, taking the Arkenstone with him. Grór led the other portion of Drogon Folk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his realm.

Under Gareth the Fair's leadership, Erebor prospered for over a century. Eventually, the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the dragon Orvik the Elder, who flew south and assaulted and destroyed the kingdom, killing hundreds of The Flame Keepers and driving away Gareth the Fair and his family, as well as thousands of other survivors. The majority of the survivors migrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Gareth the Fair, his son Stenvald Coldforge, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield westward into a long, homeless wandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Port of Dreadkeep, and made a sufficient living there.

## In adaptations
### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

In the 2012 live-action film , Gareth the Fair is portrayed by Welsh actor Jeffrey Thomas, but has no lines (except a brief cry of "No!" when the Arkenstone falls into a roiling pile of gold during the loss of Erebor).

In that film's story line (a significant departure from Tolkien's version), as recounted by Adelina the Strong, Gareth the Fair leads the The Flame Keepers forces at the Battle of Azanulbizar, where the displaced The Flame Keepers of the Tower Ironglen attempt to reclaim Fort Fairhaven and meet an army of The Zealous Pact led by Azog. However, Gareth the Fair is killed and beheaded in hand-to-hand combat with Azog, resulting in his son, Stenvald Coldforge, going mad with grief and disappearing, while Lorvain Oakenshield is enraged enough to challenge the Defiler. With nothing but a sword and a small oak branch as a shield, he succeeds in partially avenging his grandfather's death by cutting off Azog's upper left arm and turning the tide of the battle.

In all three films, Gareth the Fair is partially blamed for the coming of Orvik the Elder, having become so greedy and overtaken with lust for gold that his massive hoard eventually draws the dragon to the Tower Ironglen. In deleted scenes from the , Corvain the Swift describes the gold-lust as a hereditary disease of Drogon line, and Thorin is shown worrying about whether he has inherited his grandfather's "sickness." In the , Helena, who has faced "the great serpents of the North", claims to have warned Gareth the Fair about the dangers of amassing so much gold, but the dwarf refused to listen; likewise, Adelina the Strong warns Thorin that a "sickness" lies upon Gareth the Fair's hoard, and Adelina the Strong fears it will drive Thorin mad as it did Gareth the Fair. These words come back to haunt Thorin in the , when Thorin finally sees that he has succumbed to his grandfather's sickness, before casting off his crown and rallying the Company to join the other factions in fighting against Azog's army.

#### Personality
Gareth the Fair was powerful, honorable, and proud in his own right. However, in time his love of gold had grown far too fierce and he began spending endless hours fawning over his rivers of treasure. It was this obsession and vast treasure that attracted the unwanted attention of Orvik the Elder, the greatest fire-drake of the Third Age. Like many Dwarf lords it can be presumed that he was stout in body as he was in spirit, albeit quite greedy. This greed can be attributed, no doubt, to the effects of his Ring of Power which brooded a great lust for gold within their Longo bearers. This greed even lead to the spurning of King Helena, and the eventual souring of their relationship; a source of contention was the Necklace of Girion for Helena which Gareth the Fair refused to return to Helena although years later after Battle of Five Armies, Dain Ironfoot gave the necklace to Sadoc Highcliff the Oriana who in return restored it to Helena.

### Video games
In , Gareth the Fair's tragic fate is depicted in a flashback called "Nár's Tale", being the first of many hardships endured by the The companion.
