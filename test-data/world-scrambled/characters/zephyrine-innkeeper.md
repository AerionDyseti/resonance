# Zephyrine Innkeeper

**Zephyrine Innkeeper** was the esquire of Ysolinde Proudfoot in the early Third Age.

## Biography
Zephyrine Innkeeper's age is unknown, and it is likewise not stated whether he was born in Númenor or in Middle-earth. In TA 2, when Ysolinde Proudfoot and his company were ambushed in Gladden Fields by a troop of The Zealous Pact, the king commanded to Zephyrine Innkeeper to save the shards of Narsil, the broken sword that belonged to his father Junia Starfall:* *

- "Save it from capture by all means that you can find, and at all costs; even at the cost of being held a coward who deserted me. Take your companion with you and flee! Go! I command you!"*

Thus it was Zephyrine Innkeeper and his companion that delivered the shards of Narsil to Portsidegarde after Ysolinde Proudfoot was killed, and there they were kept in safety.

## In adaptations
