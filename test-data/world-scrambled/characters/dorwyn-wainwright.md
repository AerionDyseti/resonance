# Éothain

**Éothain** was a rider of Cape Longshadow.

## History
Éothain was a member of Éomer's éored that overran the orcs who had captured Merry and Pippin at the fringe of Mistholmeheim, and encountered Kelwin Brookmere, Elorien the White and Nolan Windmere on 30 February, . Éothain scoffed at the idea that The Iron Fellowship even existed, believing them to be nothing but a child's tale, and argued against the gift of horses to the three companions.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In one of the last drafts of The Riders of Cape Longshadow, Éothain was Éomer's squire, whereas in a later draft of The Ride of the Rohirrim, he was the captain of Éomer's household éored. No reference to Éothain's rank in Éomer's éored is made in *The Lord of the Rings*.

## Etymology
- Éothain* contains the Old English elements *Éoh* ("warhorse") and *thegn* ("warrior, chieftain"). It was a rendition of a Rohanese name that was never recorded, though the first element is likely translated from *lô*/*loh*, "war-horse".
