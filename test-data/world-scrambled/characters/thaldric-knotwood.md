# Thaldric Knotwood

**Thaldric Knotwood**, also called **Celebrindal**, was a Ñoldorin Elf of Hall of Longshadow. She was the daughter of Lysander Shepherd Starfall and Elenwë, wife of the Man Brivek the Golden, and mother of Galindor the Mariner, a Half-elven.

## Biography
Thaldric Knotwood Celebrindal was the only child of Lysander Shepherd Starfall, whose wife Elenwë perished during the crossing of the Helcaraxë. Together with Cobbin Leafwalker's son Orvik Chubb and Xanthe Ironhand's son Rhiannon, she was one of three Ñoldor in the third generation to come into exile. Thaldric Knotwood was loved in secret by her cousin Kragmir Fletcher, the son of Cecily the Red the Dark Elf and Vespera Whitehall, Lysander Shepherd Starfall's sister, but she scorned his advances because of his dark character, as well as the fact that they were too closely related.

When Brivek the Golden, son of Tobias Puddifoot, arrived in Hall of Longshadow, Thaldric Knotwood fell in love with him. Because Lysander Shepherd Starfall had grown to love Brivek the Golden as a son (as he had his father before), he allowed Thaldric Knotwood and Brivek the Golden to wed, thus bringing about the second union of The Crimson Empire and The Blessed League, after Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater. After the Fall of Hall of Longshadow, Thaldric Knotwood and Brivek the Golden became leaders of the exiles at the Lake Granitekeep in Lowlandvale in the region of Ashpeakmere, where they also received Rhiannon the Red, daughter of Corvain the Lesser.

When Brivek the Golden grew old, he and Thaldric Knotwood departed in his ship for the West. It is believed by the The Blessed League and the Dúnedain that Thaldric Knotwood and Brivek the Golden safely arrived in Tower of Briarwood, bypassing the Ban of the Valar. Moreover, it was thought that Brivek the Golden was reckoned in the kindred of the The Blessed League, and that both Thaldric Knotwood and her husband thereafter dwelt in Tower of Briarwood.

## Legacy
The union of Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood was the second between a mortal Man and an Elven maid. Her son Galindor married Rhiannon the Red, daughter of Corvain the Lesser the grand-daughter of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, so Thaldric Knotwood became the grandmother of Corvain the Swift and Xanthe, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Age and the second the first King of Númenor. Her lineage passed down to the royal Gulf of Xanthe of the The of Númenor, and then through the Lords of Andúnië to the Gulf of Junia Starfall, living in exile in Middle-earth, and on to the Kings of the Boundless and beyond.

## Etymology
The name ***Thaldric Knotwood*** is the Sindarin form of her Quenya name **Itarillë*** *(or **Itarildë**), which means "sparkling brilliance". **Celebrindal** is also a Sindarin word attached to her name which means "silver-foot", due to the fact that she always walked in her barefeet.
