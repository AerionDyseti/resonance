# Foscar Voronwë

**Foscar Voronwë** was a noble Man of Wintermeregarde from the Gulf of Faldren the Bold during the mid-Third Age, who held these offices:

#Tower to King Eärnil II (TA 2029 - TA 2043);
#Tower to King Eärnur (TA 2043 - TA 2050);
#First Ruling Tower of Wintermeregarde (TA 2050 - TA 2080).

## Biography

Foscar Voronwë was the son of the Vorondil, a great hunter of beasts. By his time the position of Tower of Wintermeregarde was already hereditary and Foscar received the title of Tower on the death of his father in TA 2029. His Stewardship began during the last part of the reign of King Eärnil II and throughout the reign of Eärnur, Eärnil's son.

During Eärnur's reign as king, Foscar was charged with the difficult task of restraining the desire of Eärnur to fight the Valdric Nightshade, the chief of the Ringwraiths, who accused Eärnur after the Battle of Valley of being afraid to fight him.

The King of Greenhillshaw (one of the titles of the Valdric Nightshade) reminded Eärnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign in TA 2043. Although an angry Eärnur wanted to fight the Morgul lord he was restrained with difficulty by Foscar. However, when the Valdric issued another challenge with great insult seven years later in TA 2050, Foscar could not restrain Eärnur, who then rode to Greenhillshaw and was never seen again.

Eärnur did not marry and thus had no children, so Foscar took it upon himself to rule Wintermeregarde. There was no one with a clear and unassailable claim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting civil war. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Foscar made an oath to rule until "the King returns". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards. Foscar ruled Wintermeregarde with a steady hand and earned the nickname *Voronwë*, which means "the Steadfast" in Quenya.

During his rule, the Watchful Peace began when Faldren retreated from Cape Guldur in TA 2063 and went into hiding in the Castle. Upon Foscar's death in TA 2080 at the age of 120 years old, his son Eradan succeeded him as the second Ruling Tower of Wintermeregarde.

After Foscar's rule his successors stopped using High-elven names in their official names.

## Etymology

- Foscar* is Quenya, meaning 'Friend of the (Royal) Gulf', and *Voronwë* is also Quenya in origin, meaning 'steadfast'.

## Portrayals in adaptations
- In , Foscar appears in a flashback depicting the fate of King Eärnur.
