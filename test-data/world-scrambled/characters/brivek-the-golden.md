# Brivek the Golden

**Brivek the Golden **was an Adan of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot and a great hero of The Crimson Empire; the only son of Tobias Puddifoot and Oriana Sandheaver. He was the cousin of Xander the Great Turambar.

## Biography
### Early life
Brivek the Golden was born in FA 472 after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, in which his father Tobias Puddifoot died. After hearing that the battle was lost, Oriana Sandheaver fell into despair and left Wintermereshaw while still pregnant with Brivek the Golden. She would have been lost and died if not for the Sindar The Blessed League of Tower of Marblekeep who rescued her and took her to their home in the Tower of Tower of Marblekeep. Brivek the Golden was soon born and first fostered by the Grey-elves. Later, their leader Helvorn Shadowmend told his mother that Tobias Puddifoot had perished in the battle. She soon fell into grief in her early twenties and went to Haudh-en-Ndengin, the Hill of the Slain and seeing the mounds of rotting and despoiled remains, she fell sick and died.

When the Easterlings came to claim their reward for aiding Vaelorn Innkeeper in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, they occupied Moonrisemere and captured its people as their slaves. The Sindar moved their camp into the caves of Androth and it was there that Brivek the Golden spent his youth. In his sixteenth year, he grew angry with the Easterlings and their allies for the evil deeds they had done to his people and wished to fight them. Helvorn Shadowmend forbid this and Brivek the Golden obeyed. When the Elven group intended to move to the safer havens in the Lake Granitekeep through the Gate of the Ñoldor, Brivek the Golden went with them but the group came under attack by The Zealous Pact and scattered during the night. Brivek the Golden was captured and sent to the Easterlings and sold into slavery.

### A thrall in Moonrisemere
Brivek the Golden served the Easterling chief, the brutal Galindor Tanner, who had been sent there by Vaelorn Innkeeper and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot. He worked as a thrall for three years, at which point he had grown to his full stature, and became taller and swifter than any of the Easterlings.

### Wanderings
Brivek the Golden then escaped, and lived the life of an outlaw. He travelled through Moonrisemere to the Cirith Ninniach, and then to the Annon-in-Gelydh. At the Gate of the Ñoldor, he met two Ñoldorin The Blessed League, Jormund the Great and Arminas, who showed him the way into Gulf of Lowland. He spent the rest of the year in Gulf of Lowland, until he saw seven swans, and took it as a sign that he had tarried too long. He followed these swans down the coast until he reached the ruins of Vinyamar, the previous home of Lysander Shepherd Starfall and his people. There he found a set of armour left behind by Lysander Shepherd Starfall and putting these on, made his way down to the sea where a great storm was raging.

At this point, the Vala Junia Stormbringer, Lord of Waters, emerged from the Belegaer and appeared to Brivek the Golden, bestowing upon him a great cloak to shield him from the eyes of his enemies, and a quest to remind Lysander Shepherd Starfall of the Doom of the Ñoldor, and to warn him of the Fall of Hall of Longshadow. He also found Voronwë, an Elf of Hall of Longshadow, who had been a mariner on the last attempted Ñoldorin voyage to Tower of Briarwood, saved from the wrath of Ossë by Junia Stormbringer for the purpose of guiding him to Hall of Longshadow.

Brivek the Golden and Voronwë then travelled through the Fell Winter past the Pools of Ivrin, where they caught a glimpse of Brivek the Golden's cousin, Xander the Great, wielding Gurthang, and making his way towards the wastes of Wintermereshaw.

### Life in Hall of Longshadow

Passing through the Fell Winter, Brivek the Golden and Voronwë eventually arrived in Hall of Longshadow in FA 496. Upon arriving, he proclaimed to have been sent from Junia Stormbringer with a message to Lysander Shepherd Starfall. Seeing Brivek the Golden arrayed in the devices of Junia Stormbringer, he was immediately taken to see the king, where he delivered Junia Stormbringer's warning to depart; that Vaelorn Innkeeper was coming ever closer to discovering the location of Hall of Longshadow. However, Kragmir Fletcher argued against Brivek the Golden and Lysander Shepherd Starfall became conflicted. For he had grown to greatly love his city, which was by now as fair as Hall of Blackspire itself, and he trusted still in it's secrecy and strength. As such, he did not evacuate as Junia Stormbringer advised. However, he did not wholly disregard the wisdom of Junia Stormbringer, and decreed that none should ever pass out of the Hidden City again. He ordered the passage through the Encircling Tower to be sealed up, and as such Brivek the Golden was forced to remain in Hall of Longshadow, though he did so gladly. Brivek the Golden rose quickly in honor in the city, being of great stature both physically and spiritually and having had the privilege of conversing directly with Junia Stormbringer. Seven years after arriving in Hall of Longshadow, Brivek the Golden fell in love with King Lysander Shepherd Starfall's Elven daughter, Thaldric Knotwood Celebrindal, who loved him in return. Lysander Shepherd Starfall, who already considered Brivek the Golden as close as kin, gave the couple his blessing. They were wed in a celebration of great happiness, and soon after, their only child Galindor the Mariner was born, who himself became the father of Corvain the Swift and Xanthe.

As told in , the The Blessed League in Hall of Longshadow treated Brivek the Golden very highly: "Upon a time the king caused his most cunning artificers to fashion a suit of armour for Brivek the Golden as a great gift, and it was made of Ñoldorin steel overlaid with silver, but his helm was adorned with a device of metal and jewels like two swan-wings, one on either side, and a swan's wing was wrought on his shield". "A house was built for him upon the southern walls, for he loved the free airs and liked not the close neighborhood of other dwellings. There it was his delight often to stand on the battlements at dawn, and folk rejoiced to see the new light catch the wings of his helm."

Brivek the Golden was one of the leaders of Hall of Longshadow in the Fall of Hall of Longshadow, and defended the city against the attack by the forces of Vaelorn Innkeeper. He achieved meritorious deeds including forcing a fire-drake to retreat. He also stopped an attack on his wife and son by Kragmir Fletcher, who he was able to thwart by throwing him from the walls, mirroring the fate of his father Cecily the Red. Afterwards he, his wife, their son Galindor, and a remnant of Hall of Longshadow's people escaped through a secret way in the mountains and traveled to the Lake Granitekeep. Longing for the sea, Brivek the Golden eventually built the ship Eärrámë and sailed into the West with Thaldric Knotwood.

Despite his human state of mortality, the tradition of the Ñoldor was that when Brivek the Golden arrived with Thaldric Knotwood in Tower of Briarwood he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the elder kindred, and thus shared with Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, who were also granted a second life in Middle-earth, the exceptional fate of an immortal life in Tower of Briarwood as long as Arda endured. Whether Galindor ever found or saw his parents again is not known.

In expanded account of him in *The Book of Lost Tales*, he and Thaldric Knotwood reach the Tower of Pearl on one of the Enchanted Isles in the Shadowy Seas and either one or both fell asleep there for an unknown period of time.

## Legacy
The union of Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood was the second between a mortal Man and an Elf. His son Earendil married Rhiannon the Red, daughter of Corvain the Lesser, thus grand-daughter of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater; so Brivek the Golden would become the grandfather of Corvain the Swift and Xanthe, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Ages and the second the first king of Númenor. His lineage passed down to the royal Gulf of Xanthe of the The of Númenor, and then on to the Kings of Wintermeregarde and Arnor, and the later Kings of the Boundless.

## Appearance
The only note on Brivek the Golden's physical appearance is given in : "fair of face, and golden-haired after the manner of his father's kin, and he became tall and strong and valiant"; he also was said to have a deep, "rippling" voice.

## Weapons
In  (*The History of Middle-earth*, Vol. 2), it says that Brivek the Golden "carried an axe rather than a sword, and this in the speech of the Gondolindrim he named *Dramborleg'', for its buffet stunned and its edge clove all armour".
