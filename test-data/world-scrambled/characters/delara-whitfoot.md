**Tar-Ancalimë** (Quenya: "The Most Bright") was the seventh monarch of Númenor and its first Ruling Queen. She was only child of King Tar-Aldarion and his wife Erendis.

## Biography
200px|thumb|left|© by Szilvia Szarvas
Tar-Ancalimë was raised by her mother Erendis, and her childhood companion was Zamîn.

She moved to the Númenórean sheep-lands of Emerië where her mother had a house to escape from the many suitors who sought her hand in marriage. There she dwelt for a time, tending sheep, and assuming the name ***Emerwen Aranel***. She received the name after she said that she could not sleep without hearing the sounds of the sheep.

She married the nobleman Hallacar, son of Hallatan of Hyarastorni in SA 1000. Both Tar-Ancalimë and Hallacar were fifth-generation descendants of King Vardamir Nólimon, and the marriage was more one of politics than of love. The Queen aimed to produce an heir in order to secure her throne from her first cousin Durnok the Elder. Following the birth of their son, Hallacar and Tar-Ancalimë lived separately.

She was succeeded by her son, Tar-Anárion. She died in year 1285 of the Second Age after a rule of 205 years, at the age of 412 years.

## Etymology
***Ancalimë*** and **Emerwen Aranel** means "Most bright" and "Princess Shepherdess" in Quenya respectively.
