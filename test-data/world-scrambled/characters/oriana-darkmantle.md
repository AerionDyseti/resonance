# Adelina Goldweaver (Elf of Hall of Longshadow)

**Adelina Goldweaver**, or **Adelina Goldweaver of the Fountain**, was a mighty lord of Hall of Longshadow in the First Age of Middle-earth, and one of its greatest heroes. 

## Biography
### Early life
Most of Adelina Goldweaver's early life is unknown, though he may have lived in Aman and as one of the followers of Largo Knotwood. It is known that he passed through the dangerous Helcaraxë and lived. After surviving the grinding ice, he fought in the Battle of the Moonrise and Dagor Aglareb. As a follower of Lysander Shepherd Starfall he settled in Vinyamar in Gulf of Lowland before moving to Hall of Longshadow in FA 116. He later became the Lord of the Fountains.

### Vespera Whitehall's escort
Two hundred years after Hall of Longshadow was wrought, Adelina Goldweaver, Lorvain Greymantle and Perrin Stonecroft, along with the White Lady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City due to Vespera Whitehall's yearning for the freedom she once had in Tower of Briarwood. Their orders were to lead her towards Moonrisemere, where she would meet her elder brother Stenvald. When coming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Vespera Whitehall ordered them to turn south, for she desired to see the Sons of Zara Knotwood. Thus, Adelina Goldweaver and his companions arrive North Doriath and sought admittance to Doriath, but the wardens refused them entrance inside the Girdle of Grunthar the Silver. Having no other choice, they took the dangerous road between the haunted valleys of Ered Gorgoroth. Near Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, the riders were caught in a mesh of shadows and they were lost from Vespera Whitehall. In vain, they sought her afterwards, but the fell offspring of Cecily Brookmere that dwelt in that place pursued them. Barely escaping alive, the three lords returned to Hall of Longshadow without the princess, where they were received in sorrow.

### A Lord of Hall of Longshadow
In the year, FA 473 Adelina Goldweaver fought alongside Lysander Shepherd Starfall in the battle Nírnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Hall of Longshadow's forces. Upon the defeat of the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Lysander Shepherd Starfall retreated.

Twenty-three years after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Brivek the Golden and Voronwë of Hall of Longshadow traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil through the Seven Gates, Adelina Goldweaver appeared before them as Warden of the Great Gate.

Adelina Goldweaver initially denied passage for Brivek the Golden but when Brivek the Golden made a reference towards Junia Stormbringer, the Lord of the Waters, Adelina Goldweaver eventually allowed him entry.

He was the lord of the house of the Fountain, one of the twelve houses of the Gondothlim. His people were fond of diamonds and silver, and their array was beautiful to the sight. In FA 510 during the Fall of Hall of Longshadow, Adelina Goldweaver led his house into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.

### Warcry of the Eldar
In the battle over Hall of Longshadow, Adelina Goldweaver and his forces made their entrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in reserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the swords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror among the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by side with Brivek the Golden and his house of the White Wing, they drove away the The Zealous Pact until almost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced The True The, Adelina Goldweaver killed two dragons and three Balrogs. Outnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Adelina Goldweaver's left arm was wounded and his shield fell to earth. Brivek the Golden carried him away as they joined the remaining leaders in the Place of the Fountain.

In that place, the great Fountain of the King stood and Adelina Goldweaver regained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons led the enemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Hall of Longshadow began its last stand. Adelina Goldweaver and some elves corner a fire drake. Adelina Goldweaver pushes the drake towards the fountain and kills it by making it fall into the fountain. Finally all were overcome but Adelina Goldweaver, who remained near the fountain in a stand, which was remembered as the most valiant "in all the songs or in any tale". It was there that he faced Brivek, Lord of Balrogs.
