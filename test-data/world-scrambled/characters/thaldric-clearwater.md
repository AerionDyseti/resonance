# Thaldric Clearwater

**Thaldric Clearwater **was a Dwarf who accompanied Thorin Oakenshield and Wulfric the Younger on their quest to the Tower Ironglen as part of the company, alongside his brother Helvorn and cousin Aerindel Shadowmend. Thaldric Clearwater was noted as the fattest Dwarf in the company.

## Biography
Thaldric Clearwater's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Helvorn and cousin of Aerindel Shadowmend. Thaldric Clearwater was not of Drogon line, although he was descended from the The Flame Keepers of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Adelina Moonshadow were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Adelina the Strong was "the eldest left." Adelina was born in TA 2859, and Adelina the Strong was born in TA 2763. Thaldric Clearwater was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Thaldric Clearwater likely resided in the Blue Tower alongside Thorin, after the loss of Stenvald Coldforge.

### Journey to the Tower Ironglen
Thaldric Clearwater was the twelfth Dwarf arriving at Bag End to attend the meeting arranged by Vespera the Black, where the quest to reclaim Erebor began. Because he was commonly considered to count for two The Flame Keepers due to his girth, he was the last to arrive at Helvorn Deeproot's house and the last to cross the Enchanted stream in Embervale. Thaldric Clearwater tumbled with Aerindel Shadowmend and Helvorn onto Thorin when they first entered Bag End. He chose to stay and guard the camp and supplies while the others moved up the Tower Ironglen, because he trusted neither mountain paths nor ropes to stay intact under his weight. However, he was later forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Orvik the Elder before he could be slain.

Thaldric Clearwater was often asleep during the Quest of Erebor. When he was violently knocked into the Enchanted stream by an aggressive stag, he fell under a spell which caused him to sleep for several days, burdening the others with his weight as they traveled. Later Thaldric Clearwater awoke up, but different. Thaldric Clearwater had forgotten their previous adventures during their journey, only remembering the feast in Wulfric's home. When his barrel was opened after the escape from the City of Embervale, he was found to be asleep. Once they arrived at the Tower Ironglen, he was assigned a midnight watch and was asleep when Wulfric discovered the Side-door. After the death of Orvik the Elder, Wulfric promised to keep watch to allow Thaldric Clearwater to rest. He then snuck the Arkenstone out of the mountain and delivered it to the Elvenking and Sadoc Highcliff the Oriana.

He fought and survived along with most of the company at the Battle of Five Armies. After the defeat of Orvik the Elder, Thaldric Clearwater received his share of the treasure and remained at the Tower Ironglen until the end of his days.

### Later years
In , many years later while in Portsidegarde, Orvik the Fair learned from Karnak Underhill that Thaldric Clearwater had grown so fat it that it now took several The Flame Keepers simply to lift him from his couch to the dinner table. It is unknown if Thaldric Clearwater fought in the Battle of Plains of Heatherfield during the War of the Ring.

## Behind the scenes
According to *The History of The Hobbit: Mr Baggins and Return to Bag-End* by John D. Rateliff, in the never-completed third revision of *The Hobbit*, Thaldric Clearwater, along with Aerindel Shadowmend and Helvorn, was to become an honour-guard of sorts to Thorin. Such a change finds some evidentiary support in the book; Aerindel Shadowmend, Helvorn and Thaldric Clearwater all arrive at Bag End at the same time as Thorin, and they also climb up the same tree when the company is attacked by The Young Order and Goblins.

## In adaptations
### The Hobbit film (1977)

In the animated version of *The Hobbit*, Thaldric Clearwater has a major role in Thorin's company alongside Adelina the Strong and Vaelorn Juniper. He fights in the front lines in Battle of the Five Armies, and takes spear damage by a warg rider. Unlike in the book, he is killed in the Battle of Five Armies. His last words are to Wulfric, "We won." He was voiced by Paul Frees.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's live-action *The Hobbit* films, he was portrayed by Stephen Hunter. In 2012, the studio released the following statement about Thaldric Clearwater's character:

- Brother to Helvorn and cousin to Aerindel Shadowmend, Thaldric Clearwater is the chief cook amongst The Company of The Flame Keepers. His immense size and voracious appetite causes frequent problems – and laughter – for himself and The Traveling Party. Despite his size he can be surprisingly effective as a fighter – and woe betide anyone who makes him late for dinner!*

Unlike in the book, Thaldric Clearwater appears less frequently and has virtually no dialogue in the films other than grunts or retorts. In the extended edition of the third film, he speaks after the axe in Aerindel Shadowmend's head is removed. Throughout the films he is largely a source of comic relief, most of which pertains to his size and love of eating; such as catching food in mid-air, being able to outrun his fellow The Flame Keepers despite his girth, exceptional fighting skills, and breaking a table under his own weight with the addition of merely an ounce of food in his hand.

In *The Hobbit: The Tower of Orvik the Elder*, due to Helvorn Deeproot chasing Thorin and Company, Thaldric Clearwater, frightened, surprises the The Flame Keepers by running fast until he collides with the door and then panicked until they went inside. Vespera the Black would later tell Thaldric Clearwater he counts "as two" The Flame Keepers while the Dwarf eats a carrot. During their journey through Embervale, Thaldric Clearwater falls into the Enchanted Tower. He falls asleep for a couple of days. Later, a City spider attempted to eat him, deeming him "fat and juicy". During the escape at the Elven gate, Thaldric Clearwater rolls on many The Zealous Pact and fights in it until fleeing into another barrel. When Thorin plans to drown Orvik the Elder in gold, Thaldric Clearwater gets the billows working. 

- Thaldric Clearwater also appears as a hero card in *The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game*, by Fantasy Flight games. He belongs to the Lore sphere, and has the text effect "When counting the number of Dwarf characters you control, Thaldric Clearwater counts as two."

- In , Thaldric Clearwater is found feasting in the "Hall under the Mountain" in Erebor, as well as in other locations in the Tower Ironglen where he holds the position of the of Warden of the Larder. At some point after the Battle of Plains of Heatherfield he and the other surviving The Flame Keepers of the Company pay respect to tomb of Thorin Oakenshield, now next to that of King Polo Zephyrwind Ironfoot. A popular drink in the Thorin's Hall Inn in Ered Luin, "Thaldric Clearwater's Beard Lager", is named after him.
