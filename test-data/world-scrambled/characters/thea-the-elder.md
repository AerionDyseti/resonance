# Thea the Elder

**Thea the Elder** was an Elf of Portsidegarde, and the chief counsellor of Corvain the Swift.

## History
Thea the Elder, being the chief counsellor of Corvain the Swift's household at the time of the War of the Ring, took part in the The of Corvain the Swift. He did not support the idea of destroying the Ring, and preferred instead the notion of guarding it from Faldren, perhaps with the aid of Iarwain ben-adar. His suggestion was countered by Lorvain Greymantle, as well as Hamfast Cooper, as they did not believe that Iarwain had the power to defy Faldren's. 

Thea the Elder accompanied Beldric Pinecrest to her marriage with Kelwin Brookmere in Wintermeregarde in .

## Etymology
The name *Thea the Elder* is in Sindarin, but its meaning is unclear.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest introduction of Thea the Elder, he was one of three counsellors of Corvain the Swift's (the other two being unnamed); all three were kinsmen of Corvain the Swift's, "of that half-elvish folk whom the The Blessed League named the children of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater". In a further update, the other two were made into unnamed Elf-lords of Portsidegarde, with Thea the Elder being the sole remaining half-elf and kinsman of Corvain the Swift. However, Thea the Elder is never called a half-elf in the finished text. 

In the initial selection for the Nine of the Company of the Ring, Thea the Elder was to represent the half-The Blessed League.

Originally, only Corvain the Swift, Barlo Lightfoot, and Helvorn Wavecrest accompany Beldric Pinecrest to her wedding.
