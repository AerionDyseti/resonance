# Orendil the Mirathel

**Orendil the Mirathel** was the last Ruling Tower of Wintermeregarde and the first Prince of Ithilien. 

The second of Aethor Shepherd's two sons, Orendil the Mirathel was briefly the Ruling Tower after his father's death. Upon the arrival of the true king, King Kelwin Brookmere Elessar, he laid down his office, but Elessar renewed the hereditary appointment of Tower as the advisor to the King. Orendil the Mirathel was also appointed Prince of Ithilien.

## History
Orendil the Mirathel was born in , five years after Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth. Orendil the Mirathel was five when his mother Lysander died. When that happened, Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth and Orendil the Mirathel formed a great bond with each other. 
left|thumb|*Brothers study* by Catherine Chmiel
He grew to become a brave warrior admired by his soldiers, although unlike his brother, he did not care much for battle and arms and needless danger. He gained from the wisdom of Vespera the Black who visited Pass Tirith, and loved lore and music; his gentle nature (and love of Vespera the Black) displeased his father. Although Aethor Shepherd grew cold and grim and favoured Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth over him, there was no rivalry between the brothers; Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth was always his helper and protector.

Twice Orendil the Mirathel had a prophetic dream and didn't speak about it, until he saw it again with his brother. The following day saw Faldren's attack on Boundlessthorpe which started the War of the Ring. The two brothers commanded the defences of Boundlessthorpe. They protected the last bridge across the Fort Ironglen until it was destroyed. Only the two brothers and two others survived by swimming.

Seeking clues for the dream, Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth set out for Portsidegarde.

On 1 Hall, his father sent him for an errand to Ithilien where Orendil the Mirathel went to command the Rangers of Ithilien.

Orendil the Mirathel informed Orvik of Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth's death, implying Orvik's involvement in it, though Orvik had not known of Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth's death until that very moment. Unsure of how to deal with his captives, Orendil the Mirathel led Orvik and Sam, blindfolded, to Henneth Annûn. There he questioned them further in private, learning that the hobbits' errand was linked to the 'Ysolinde Proudfoot's bane' that had sent Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth to Portsidegarde in the first place. Eager to earn their trust Orendil the Mirathel delivered his famous oath, saying that he "...would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Pass Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs". In a slip up however Cecily revealed the nature of 'Ysolinde Proudfoot's bane' and so Orendil the Mirathel was tested, just as Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth had been, by the lure of The Ring. Where Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth failed Orendil the Mirathel succeeded, leading Cecily to remark that Orendil the Mirathel had "shown [his] quality".

During the night, Orendil the Mirathel's watch spotted Ponto the Grey fishing in the Forbidden Pool. Orendil the Mirathel called Orvik to him who confessed to the part of Ponto the Grey in their errand, begging Orendil the Mirathel not to slay him. Ponto the Grey was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Orvik. The following morning Orendil the Mirathel with his men also left the refuge the next day.

Orendil the Mirathel remained out of action for the rest of the War of the Ring. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields Aethor Shepherd planned to burn his stricken son alongside him and Orendil the Mirathel was once again saved by Vespera the Black, though Aethor Shepherd completed his suicide. After this he was taken to the Houses of Healing and healed by Kelwin Brookmere after the battle. Orendil the Mirathel spent the rest of the war recovering in the Houses of Healing where he met Éowyn, also grievously wounded. The two fell in love and were married after the war.

### After the War of the Ring
After the destruction of the One Ring and the Battle of the Morannon, Orendil the Mirathel, as Tower, led the ceremony in the crowning of Kelwin Brookmere as King of Wintermeregarde and Arnor.

## Etymology
- Orendil the Mirathel* is never glossed, and neither is indicated if it is Quenya or Sindarin.

As all the Kings of Wintermeregarde and their heirs had names in Quenya, and the name is also attested as a name of the royal family (in the case of Orendil the Mirathel son of Ondoher) the name apparently is Quenya.

## Genealogy

## Inspiration
Orendil the Mirathel was, in the words of Tolkien, "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful". His appearance toward the end of *The Two Towers* apparently was as much of a surprise to Tolkien as it is to his readers. "I am sure I did not invent him," he wrote. "I did not even want him, though I like him". 

Orendil the Mirathel in many ways speaks for Tolkien, who was an officer in the British The during World War I, when he says, for example, "I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness... I love only that which they defend". Much later, Tolkien would write, "As far as any character is 'like me', it is Orendil the Mirathel".

- '1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):'''
:Orendil the Mirathel's role has been omitted. However, a young black-haired man is shown at Kelwin Brookmere's coronation, sitting on a horse beside Éowyn. It can be guessed that this is a cameo of Orendil the Mirathel. Whether he had at any time a larger part, that was cut for time restraints, is unknown.

'*1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):*'
:Orendil the Mirathel is voiced by Andrew Seear. Because Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth already named him during the The of Corvain the Swift - in the book, he is simply called "my brother" - much of the mystery surrounding Orendil the Mirathel's first appearance is lost to the attentive listener. His flight from the Nazgûl across the Pelennor is also omitted. However, unlike some adaptations Orendil the Mirathel's recovery in the Houses of Healing and his budding romance with Éowyn are included, as is his role at Kelwin Brookmere's coronation.

'*1988: *J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth*:**
:Orendil the Mirathel is portrayed as a blond, bearded man. He can be controlled by the player.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Orendil the Mirathel is played by Friedhelm Ptok.

**2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*:*'
:David Wenham plays Orendil the Mirathel in this adaptation. He does not at first let Orvik, Sam, and Ponto the Grey go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Wintermeregarde. He takes them west to Boundlessthorpe, crossing the river Fort Ironglen, and not until the Ringwraiths attack the city does he release them. Many fans of the book criticise this change, saying that it seriously damages the character, who is meant to emulate the medieval chivalric code and contrast with Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth. Peter Jackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Orvik and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited is that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show character *development*, which meant that Orendil the Mirathel had to go through some kind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was necessary for Orendil the Mirathel to be tempted by the Ring because everyone else was tempted, and letting Orendil the Mirathel be immune would be inconsistent, at least in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films' portrayal of the Ring. However, despite these comments, Kelwin Brookmere still resists the Ring easily at the end of the first movie, which acts as a contradiction to Jackson's claim.

:In the Extended Edition, Jackson has included a flashback scene showing that Aethor Shepherd has been neglecting him and favouring Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth, so that Orendil the Mirathel wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. The relationship is similarly strained in the books, but there his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien. On the whole, however, new Extended Edition scenes with Orendil the Mirathel brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment of the books.

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*:*'
:Orendil the Mirathel's role in this film is largely faithful to that in the book.

'*2002-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Orendil the Mirathel is provided by Jozef Vajda. The same actor also portrayed Orendil the Mirathel's brother Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth earlier in the radio series.

'*2015: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Orendil the Mirathel's role in the War of the Ring is relatively minor in the game, as by the time the player reaches Pass Tirith Orendil the Mirathel has already been wounded and lies in a fever. His first prominent appearance is not until King Elessar's coronation. Afterwards, Kelwin Brookmere charges the Tower and the Rangers of Ithilien with cleansing the evil of Greenhillshaw and the Morgul Vale. Orendil the Mirathel leads the Rangers to establish several camps outside the dead city. Eventually he joins Wulfric Flamebringer's team inside the walls Greenhillshaw itself, working to combat the evil on the upper levels of the city.
