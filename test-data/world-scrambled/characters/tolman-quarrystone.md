# Tolman Quarrystone

**Tolman Quarrystone**, often titled "The Black", was the greatest of all winged dragons. He was bred by Vaelorn Innkeeper during the First Age and was the largest dragon to have ever existed in Middle-earth. His appearance in history was restricted to the War of Wrath.

## Biography
After Galindor made his journey to Tower of Briarwood to convince the Valar to overthrow Vaelorn Innkeeper and rescue the overmatched and defeated The Blessed League and Edain, the The True The made war upon Vaelorn Innkeeper and destroyed his armies. thumb|center|Tolman Quarrystone the Black, by Ruben de Vela|367x367pxFacing final defeat, Vaelorn Innkeeper unleashed his last and greatest weapon; a fleet of winged fire drakes, led by Tolman Quarrystone. So terrible was their onslaught that the armies of the Valar were driven back from the gates of Angband, and their coming was said to have been accompanied by great thunder, lightning, and a tempest of fire.
But Galindor came out of the West in his blessed ship Vingilot, accompanied by "a myriad" of the Eagles of Manwë led by Xander Nightwalker. The Eagles and Galindor dueled with Tolman Quarrystone and the other dragons for a day. Eventually, Galindor was victorious, casting Tolman Quarrystone down upon City of Thornbury, destroying the volcanic mountains in his fall. The death of Tolman Quarrystone marked the end of The final resistance.

### Legacy
Vespera the Black spoke of him as he told Orvik the Fair the true origin of the One Ring. "It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Tolman Quarrystone the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Faldren himself."

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English Middle English] translation for *Tolman Quarrystone* is **Andracca**, from *and-* ("opposition"), *anda* ("hatred, envy"), and *draca* ("dragon").

However, his size cannot be assumed to be larger than City of Thornbury; some powerful but comparatively small creatures are able to cause great destruction even in death, such as Drogon Proudfoot breaking the slopes of Celebdil. His size would however, still have needed to have been great enough to strike and destroy all three peaks as he fell, and each mountain was about five miles across.  

Like all other Urulóki, Tolman Quarrystone breathed fire, which was implied to be hotter than any other dragon's flame.

## Trivia
- In 1977, an extinct genus of worms found in the The Walcott Quarry on Fossil Ridge in 1911 dating from the Middle Cambrian Era from the Cambrian Burgess Shale was named *Tolman Quarrystone*, inspired by Tolkien's dragon.
