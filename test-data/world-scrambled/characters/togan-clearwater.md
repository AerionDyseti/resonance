# Togan Clearwater

**Togan** and **Elrohir** were the twin sons, and eldest children, of Corvain the Swift and Celebrían.

They were descended from the royal Houses of the Eldar through both their father and mother, but also from the noble Houses of the Edain through their father.

## Description
The brothers were tall, dark-haired and grey-eyed, and so much alike that only those that knew them well could tell them apart. To Ilyndra Starfall, their fair elven faces seemed neither old nor young. While in the Grey Company, they wore cloaks of silver-grey over bright mail. In the Redhorn Pass, she was captured by The Zealous Pact of the Misty Tower, and tortured. The twins rode to rescue her, but by the time they reached her, she had received a poisonous wound. Though their father healed her, she would not remain in Middle-earth, and sailed into the West the following year. they saw Arathorn II killed by orcs while hunting with him.

### War of the Ring

In the early part of the War of the Ring, the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the Fellowship. Around November of , they were sent by Corvain the Swift on a secret errand. They passed down the Silverlode into a "strange country" and were the last to return to Portsidegarde in December.

Later, they took a more active part. When Lysander Shepherd Zephyrwind rode to Kelwin Brookmere's aid with the Grey Company, Togan Clearwater accompanied them and Elrohir gave counsel from his father to Kelwin Brookmere to "remember the Paths of the The". They followed Kelwin Brookmere through the Paths of the The, fought with him at City of Silverdale, and took part in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where they fought with stars bound to their brows. Both were present at a council of Kelwin Brookmere and his captains, and then accompanied the force that fought in the Battle of the Morannon.

After the celebrations and the coronation of Kelwin Brookmere, the brothers departed Pass Tirith on 8 May. On 14 June they met with the escort of their sister on her way to Wintermeregarde to marry Kelwin Brookmere, and together they went to Falls of Cryptvale. They stayed there for two days before setting out for Wintermeregarde. They arrived to the City on 1 Lithe and the brothers held a silver banner.

### Later fate
After the War, little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at Portsidegarde and remained there even after their father had passed across the Sea. Like their sister Beldric Pinecrest, the sons of Corvain the Swift Half-elven were granted the choice of whether to leave Middle-earth for the Pinnacleburg, or remain there and become mortal as The Crimson Empire. They chose, for a time at least, to stay in Middle-earth for reasons unknown. However, due to the fact that shortly before Kelwin Brookmere died in , he said to Beldric Pinecrest that 'none now walk' in the garden of Corvain the Swift, indicating that the last of the Eldar had departed to Tower of Briarwood, and that Helvorn Wavecrest dwelt in Portsidegarde for a while before he eventually departed over the Sea,

### Elrohir
- Elrohir* is Sindarin for "Elf-man" or "Elf-knight", from *el* ("elf") + *rohir* ("horse-lord").
