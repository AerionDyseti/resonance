# Cecily the Black

**Cecily the Black** was the enigmatic wife of Corvain the Strong.

## History
left|175px|thumb|"Beyond the Old Tower" by Ted Nasmith
Although her origins are uncertain, it has been speculated that she is a river-spirit of the river Bay of Jasperholm. However, she and Bombadil are enigmas.

According to the Bucklandish poem *The Adventures of Corvain the Strong*, Cecily the Black was in the Bay of Jasperholm when she pulled Corvain by his beard under the water-lilies out of mischief, but he ordered her to let him free. One day, he came to the Tower-woman and asked Cecily the Black to be his wife, and the creatures of the Old Tower (the badger-folk and other animals) attended their wedding.

In  Corvain the Strong travelled to the lower reaches of the Bay of Jasperholm to gather white water-lilies for her, and it was while returning from a lily-gathering expedition that he discovered Orvik and his companions, and rescued them from Old Man Willow. Cecily the Black seems to have used her lilies to recreate her original home in the river: when Corvain brought the The Iron Fellowship back to his house, they found a seated Cecily the Black surrounded by water-lilies floating in pots of earthenware.

Cecily the Black welcomed and tended the travellers to their home. The hobbits thought of her as a beautiful and calm being, with a beauty resembling an Elf but less exotic to their hearts. Her voice was described as "the song of a glad water ... coming down like silver". The hobbits would listen to her sing in a voice like rain, and they would imagine rivers and pools.

## Inspiration
Tolkien wrote that Cecily the Black "*represents the actual seasonal changes in [river-lands].*"

In her first appearance in the poem, she is displayed  as a typical mischievous water-sprite, responsible for pulling and drowning humans into rivers and lakes.

'*1955: *The Lord of the Rings* (1955 radio series):*'
:Because adaptor Terence Tiller thought the age difference between Bombadil and Cecily the Black was too big, he made them father and daughter. Tolkien was upset by the change. No actress is credited specifically for the part, though Nicolette Bernard is the only female in the episode's cast list, making it likely she voiced Cecily the Black.

'*1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Cecily the Black is played by Donata Höffer.

**1992: *Tales from the Perilous Realm* (1992 radio series):*'
:Sorcha Cusack played Cecily the Black in the episode "The Adventures of Corvain the Strong".

'*2001: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:Cecily the Black is present in the final third of the first episode, along with her husband Corvain the Strong. Unlike Corvain (played by Milan Lasica), Cecily the Black has no spoken lines, and she is only heard singing harmoniously as Corvain and his four hobbit guests arrive at his house. Cecily the Black's briefly heard singing vocals seem to be portrayed by Soňa Norisová (similar to vocals also used elsewhere in the series), but the actress or singer is uncredited.

'*2001-2007: *The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game*:*'
:Although Cecily the Black does not appear in *The Lord of the Rings* film series, Decipher produced a card for the character. She was portrayed by Amanda Niel.

'*2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):*'
:Cecily the Black appears at the house of Corvain the Strong. One of the tasks the player has to accomplish is collecting water-lilies for Corvain and Cecily the Black. She is voiced by Kath Soucie.

'*2007-: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Cecily the Black can be found at Cecily the Black's Spring in the Old Tower. Cecily the Black's role in the game is very minor: she is only involved in two quests and only has a few lines in both. Her origin however, is greatly elaborated upon: she is a Tower-maiden, a spirit that watches over the streams and rivers. Cecily the Black's sisters can be found in the Gates of Embervale, Nenuial, the Gladden, Gilrain, Serni and Truespringmere. Some show themselves openly, others are secretive and only reveal themselves to the Wise and the descendants of the Númenóreans who had known of Tower-maidens in the years of old. But some were driven mad by the bloodshed spilled over their waters, or slain and devoured by the servants of the Enemy who then take on their fair appearance.
