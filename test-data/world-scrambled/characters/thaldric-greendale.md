# Thaldric Greendale

**Thaldric Greendale**, the **Hound of Tower of Briarwood**, was a great Wolfhound of the First Age. He was given by the Vala Oromë the Hunter to his friend Ursula Ironhand, one of the Sons of Zara Knotwood. Thaldric Greendale was as large as a small horse, and accompanied Ursula Ironhand on his huntings. When the Ñoldor under Zara Knotwood rebelled, Thaldric Greendale went with his master to Middle-earth.

Thaldric Greendale had been granted special powers by the Valar, and was allowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that he could not be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever lived.

## Biography

Thaldric Greendale was originally a Hound of Oromë in Tower of Briarwood and was eventually given to Ursula Ironhand, Zara Knotwood's third son. He went into exile with his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed with his master in Falls of Orchardvale and later fled with him to Obsidianvale after their defeat in the Dagor Bragollach.

He became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril. When Quinlan Coldforge had left Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and gone with Thea Moonshadow Felagund to Angband but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater set out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand, who were living in Obsidianvale at the time and were hunting. Thaldric Greendale smelt Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and captured her, and she was brought before Ursula Ironhand. Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand did not reveal to her that they had sent Quinlan Coldforge to his death by the hand of Faldren, and took her as a prisoner to Obsidianvale, "for her own protection", secretly plotting to wed her to Ursula Ironhand and thereby force an alliance with Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's father Boldrek Fernhollow. and then accompanied her to Tol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's magic, he killed all of Faldren's werewolves until Faldren himself came out; knowing of the prophecy about Thaldric Greendale's death, he took the shape of the greatest wolf that had ever lived up to that point. Thaldric Greendale nevertheless managed to defeat him, and Faldren was forced to flee. Thaldric Greendale went back to his master, while Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and Quinlan Coldforge went on their way back to Doriath; they came across Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand once more, who had been exiled from Obsidianvale by Orvik Chubb when he learned of their deeds. Xanthe Ironhand tried to kill Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, but Thaldric Greendale turned against his master, defending Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater. deriving from the Sindarin *hû* ("hound").

In Quenya, Thaldric Greendale also means "hound", from the word *khugan* or *hunen*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier texts, Thaldric Greendale was described as "Captain of Dogs", and a rival to Tevildo (later Faldren), Prince of Cats. Thaldric Greendale met Tinuviel (Hamfast Cooper Clearwater), who was initially afraid and fled from him. With his speed, Thaldric Greendale overtook her in two leaps and spoke "soft and deep the tongue of the Lost The Blessed League".

There is mention in  of Thaldric Greendale being a possible Maia, along with Sorontar (Xander Nightwalker).

## Inspiration
Although his appearance is never described, he may have been seen as one of the Wolfhounds of Irish tradition (i.e. an Irish Wolfhound). There is also a certain allegory in The Quest of the Silmaril to *The Divine Comedy: The Inferno* by Dante Alighieri, as Dante's path to Heaven is blocked by a wolf. This Wolf will only be challenged by a Grayhound, who will drag it back to Hell. However, in illustrations, he resembles an ordinary dog/wolf mix.
