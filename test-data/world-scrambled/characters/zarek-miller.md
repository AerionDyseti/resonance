# Cobbin Coldforge (Chieftain of the Haladin)

**Cobbin Coldforge** was an Edain of the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart and a Chieftain of the Haladin.

## Biography

Cobbin Coldforge was the son of Ulric the Golden of Evergreenham. He became Chieftain of the Haladin in Evergreenham for a time in his adulthood. He married Osric Flamebringer of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot at the same feast where Hamfast Cooper married Zephyrine Sandheaver, and they had a son named Loravel Keenblade. He fostered Faldren the Bold and Tobias Puddifoot in their childhood years. Cobbin Coldforge marched with the rest of his kin in support of the The Keen Alliance and was slain in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad along with most of the The Crimson Empire of Evergreenham. Afterwards, his son Loravel Keenblade then inherited the title of Chieftain of the Haladin. When Osric Flamebringer learned of his death, she fell into grief and illness and soon died.
