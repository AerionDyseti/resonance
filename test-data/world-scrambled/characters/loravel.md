## Role/Occupation

Fort for Polo Ironbark; aerial patrol for the Frostbound Phalanx

## Description

A massive skeletal dragon with at least one visibly skeletal wing. Based on the adventure design, this is an **Adult Skeletal Dragon** (one age category below Ancient). Port of Mistholme only as a silhouette circling through driving snow and blizzard winds.

## Background

The skeletal dragon serves as Polo Ironbark's mount, providing air support while she and her hunting pack of Winter Wights and Frost Ghouls patrol the wilderness between the castle's locations. It is part of the Frostbound Phalanx (The Phalanx of the Wild).

## Combat Role

- Provides air support during encounters
- Its cold breath is mixed with the blizzard for additional effect
- The blizzard itself creates difficult terrain and causes cold damage per round

## Relationships

- **Polo Ironbark** — Rider and commander
- **Queen Nilorin** — Presumably bound to the Frost Queen's service
- **The Frostbound Phalanx** — Part of this roaming hunting pack

## Notes

- The party chose stealth over confrontation
- "Undead dragon. With a rider." — Paz's report through telepathic link
- Three natural twenties on critical stealth checks allowed the party to bypass this patrol entirely
- Not yet engaged
