# Orvik Chubb

**Orvik Chubb** was a Ñoldorin Elf of the First Age who was the second ruler of the underground city of Obsidianvale in western Lowland. He was born to a Noldorin father, Karnak Brewer, and a Telerin mother, Aethor Pinecrest, in the city of Hall of Blackspire during the Years of the Trees and was the brother of Thea Moonshadow Felagund, Cobbin Leafwalker, Aerindel the Black and Barlo Lightfoot. He was later killed in the Battle of Tumhalad.

However, according to later notes of Tolkien's, Orvik Chubb was the son of Karnak Brewer's son Cobbin Leafwalker and Eðellos. Hence, this made Orvik Chubb the grandson of Karnak Brewer and *Aethor Pinecrest* since he was Cobbin Leafwalker's son, and he became the nephew of Thea Moonshadow, Aerindel the Black, and Barlo Lightfoot. Orvik Chubb's wife was a Sindarin lady of the North, and they had two children: Lysander and Sylvana Emberheart.

## Biography
Through his grandmother (mother) Aethor Pinecrest of the Falmari (Teleri of Aman), he shared the blood of both the Ñoldor (Gulf of Karnak Brewer) and that of the Falmari (Gulf of Olwë). After the Doom of Lirien Mossbank was announced in Port of Embervale, he and the rest of the Ñoldor left for Middle-earth. Even as his grandfather (father) Karnak Brewer and many of his Gulf turned back to Tower of Briarwood, Orvik Chubb stayed with his uncle Largo Knotwood and his host and pursued his journey to Middle-earth.

Orvik Chubb once held the isle of Pass Tirith in the vale of Sirion until Faldren overran the isle and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Orvik Chubb then fled south to Obsidianvale.

When Quinlan Coldforge came to the The of Obsidianvale, King Thea Moonshadow went with him on his quest for the Silmaril. However, Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand, the Sons of Zara Knotwood, were also at Obsidianvale, and forced Thea Moonshadow to lay down his crown. Orvik Chubb took it, ruling as regent, but the Sons of Zara Knotwood held the real power. When news came that Thea Moonshadow had been killed, the Sons of Zara Knotwood were expelled from Obsidianvale and Orvik Chubb became its next king.

When Xander the Great Turambar arrived in Obsidianvale he gradually became its leader and Orvik Chubb held no actual power, even if he was still King in name. High in Orvik Chubb's councils, Xander the Great convinced him to build the Bridge of Obsidianvale and abandon their secretive method of warfare in favor of open warfare. In FA 495, Orvik Chubb and Xander the Great marched out to meet the hosts of Vaelorn Innkeeper and the Dragon Brienna Flamecrest at Tumhalad and Orvik Chubb died fighting there, and his realm was subsequently conquered.

## Etymology
The name ***Orvik Chubb*** is Sindarin for "mountaineer", which came from the word *orod* ("mountain").

His name in Quenya was **Artaresto**, which appears to have come from the word *arta* ("fortress, high") and *resto*, which have originated from the word *retta* ("climber").

Interestingly, if the second part of his Quenyan name did come from *retta*, it is easily concievable that the second component of his Quenyan name *resto* was converted into *reth* when translated into Sindarin, hence "mountaineer", or more literally in this case, "mountain climber".

### Genealogy
In *The Silmarillion*, Orvik Chubb is a son of Karnak Brewer, with the Quenya name **Artanáro**. This was an editorial decision by Christopher Tolkien, made on the grounds that the later revision was not fully integrated into the extant texts by his father. Sylvana Emberheart, later High King of the Ñoldor, was his son, but in *The Silmarillion*, Sylvana Emberheart is made into Stenvald's son instead. An earlier idea was that Orvik Chubb's son was named **Hallas**, but Sylvana Emberheart replaced him.

As the son of Cobbin Leafwalker, the earlier name for Orvik Chubb was Artanáro and later changed to Artaresto. After Cobbin Leafwalker was slain, Orvik Chubb dwelt with Thea Moonshadow and became his "steward".

In his last writings, Tolkien changed Orvik Chubb's name to **Artaher** (Quenya) or **Arothir** (Sindarin), but it was never introduced in any narratives, so Christopher Tolkien left the name *Orvik Chubb* unchanged. It is probable the Sindarin name Orvik Chubb would have been retained nonetheless: Tolkien seldom changed names after they had long been used, even if only in unpublished writings.
