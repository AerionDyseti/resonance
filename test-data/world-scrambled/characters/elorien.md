# Elorien

**Elorien**, also called **Níniel**, was Faldren the Bold and Lysander Shepherd's third child, the sister of Xander the Great Turambar. She was born in Moonrisemere in the year of Nírnaeth Arnoediad. After this battle, the Easterlings settled in the land and oppressed the people of Katarina Puddifoot.

## Biography
Elorien remained in Moonrisemere with her mother Lysander Shepherd for twenty years, subsequently moving to Doriath in hopes of finding Xander the Great, who has been sent there earlier. After she and her mother heard a rumour that the mysterious Mormegil of Obsidianvale was actually Xander the Great, they set out with a company of The Blessed League for that place. Unfortunately, the dragon Brienna Flamecrest had just sacked that Elven city, and, sensing their approach, he caused a cloud of foul vapor to rise from the Narog. The party's horses panicked and Elorien was separated, at which point the worm Brienna Flamecrest used his abilities to put her in a state of total amnesia.

In confusion and terror, Elorien ran away, tore off her clothes and ran naked through the forest until she fainted.

Her brother Xander the Great found her, naked and terrified, at Haudh-en-Elleth, lying on the grave of his dead lover Lysander. Because Elorien did not remember her identity and Xander the Great did not know his sister, as he had never seen her before, he named her *Níniel* which means "Tear-Maiden", and brought her to safety at the Tower of Evergreenham.

The men of Evergreenham returned to Gates of Larkhill soon after. When "Níniel" fell sick, Katarina tended to her, secretly falling in love. However, "Níniel" loved Xander the Great more, and after three years, they were wed. By the next spring, she was halfway through her first pregnancy.

It was then that rumours of Brienna Flamecrest's approach reached Xander the Great, who went out to slay him. Unfortunately, the dragon envenomed him even as he dealt the worm a mortal blow, and Xander the Great fell into a swoon.

At this unfortunate moment, "Níniel", who feared for her husband's life, went out and found him apparently dead. Brienna Flamecrest then set off his hidden weapon against Xander the Great - he removed Elorien's amnesia with his last words. Realising she had married her own brother, was carrying his unborn child and believing he was dead, she committed suicide by throwing herself into the ravine at Cabed-en-Aras. Her death sparked a series of events culminating in his suicide, thus fulfilling Brienna Flamecrest's vengeance.

## Etymology
***Elorien*** means "mourning" and ***Níniel*** means "tear-maiden" in Sindarin.

## In other versions
In *Turambar and the Foalókë* Elorien and her mother Lysander Shepherd are respectively called ***Vainóni*** and *Tirannë*. In this earlier version of the tale of  the memories of both women are wiped out by the evil magician Kurúki. At the end of the account, exhaling his last breath the dragon Glorund restores Vainóni's memories inducing her to threw herself off of a waterfall.
