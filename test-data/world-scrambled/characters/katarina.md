# Katarina

**Katarina the Lame** was a Man of the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart. He was the son of Loravel Keenblade and Beldis and was named after his mother’s brother. Katarina became a leader of his people despite his deformity, yet he became ensnared by the doom of Xander the Great and died by his sword unjustly.

## History
Katarina suffered some accident in his childhood that resulted in a broken leg and left him lame thereafter. Due to his mishap and because of his gentle mood he was never a man of war, taking delight instead in all things that grew in the earth. Yet after his father died Katarina inherited the chieftainship of the The Crimson Empire of Evergreenham and thus was their lord when Xander the Great arrived in . In order to protect his people, Katarina sought silence and secrecy, far from the other fights of Lowland.

By the third year of Xander the Great's abiding at Isle of Lowland he had become the *de facto* leader of the The Crimson Empire of Evergreenham; Katarina went unheeded. Xander the Great led the woodmen in many battles against the The Zealous Pact, yet these deeds drew the dread dragon Brienna Flamecrest from ruined Obsidianvale, who crawled in a straight path towards Evergreenham. When Xander the Great asked for volunteers to go with him to meet the dragon, Wulfric the Old came forth. Seeing the others hold back, Wulfric the Old chided them and asked if none would take the place of Katarina so that the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart would not be put to shame. Thus Katarina, long unheeded, was subjected to scorn and became bitter at heart.

After Xander the Great, Wulfric the Old, and Roderick Moonshadow had gone, Níniel decided that she had to follow her husband. Ignoring Katarina's plea that she wait, Níniel led a great company of the woodmen to Nen Girith to seek tidings of the three hunters' fate. Unable to endure the scorn and disdain that had been heaped upon him, Katarina renounced his lordship and people. Yet still he loved Níniel and so, taking up his crutch and a short sword, he hobbled after the throng.

Katarina caught up with Níniel at Nen Girith where she had been stricken upon hearing the far-off voice of Brienna Flamecrest. Katarina attempted to lead her away to safety but she sped away to seek Xander the Great. Again Katarina was forced to limp after her as best he could. Again he caught up with her but too late, for by then Brienna Flamecrest had revealed to Níniel that she was in truth Elorien, sister of Xander the Great, and that she carried her brother's child in her belly. Katarina heard Brienna Flamecrest's words and was so stricken that he leaned against a tree. For a third time Níniel ran with Katarina calling after her but this time he could not catch up, for Elorien cast herself into the waters of Cabed-en-Aras. Katarina was the last man to peer into its darkness and he turned away in horror.

Limping back to Nen Girith, Katarina encountered Wulfric the Old, who had quailed at crossing the Teiglin. Realizing that Wulfric the Old' cowardice had contributed to Níniel's death, Katarina proclaimed his hatred for Wulfric the Old. Wulfric the Old tried to strike Katarina but died when Katarina hewed him with his sword. Katarina then hobbled on to bring the tidings to the people of Evergreenham still gathered at Nen Girith.

Katarina had thought Xander the Great dead, and thus was amazed when he appeared before the gathering. Katarina then told Xander the Great that his wife was dead and revealed that she had been his sister. In wrath Xander the Great called Katarina "Club-foot" and slandered him, and then drew the black sword Gurthang and slew him. However, Xander the Great soon met Valdric Shepherd the Hunter who confirmed Katarina's words. Xander the Great ran and asked his sword if it would slay him swiftly. Gurthang replied that it would, to forget the blood of Eldris Quicksilver, killed by accident, and Katarina, killed unjustly.

## Etymology

In *The Etymologies*, the name *Katarina* is said to be a compound of *brand* + *dîr*, meaning "Noble Man".

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In *The Book of Lost Tales Part Two*, "Turambar and the Foalókë", the lame woodman who would come to love Níniel was called ***Tamar Lamefoot***. He was the eldest son of the leader of the woodmen, Quelvar Stormwind, and an Elf-maiden of the Noldoli, making him Half-elven. Tamar, who was paid little attention to, grew to love Níniel, but in vain. It was Tamar who followed Níniel after the defeat of Glorund, and who watched as Glorund revealed her identity to her. He continued after her when she fled, and saw her cast herself into the stream. Grieved, he returned to the people, and declared that Turambar was dead, and Níniel, who was in truth Nienóri the sister of Turambar, had cast herself into the stream and perished. But Turambar, who was not dead as had been thought, came back among the people. Upon hearing Tamar's proclamation that Níniel was Nienóri, Turambar thought him a liar, and slew him.

In *The Quenta*, Katarina's lameness was attributed to being wounded by an Orc-arrow as a child. He was also noted as uncomely and of less might than many; and for those reasons he yielded rule of the woodsfolk to Xander the Great by their choice.
