# Lorvain the Red

**Lorvain the Red** was an Easterling Man and the son of Osric the Great. 

## Biography

Like his father, Lorvain the Red entered Lowland and pledged his service to the Sons of Zara Knotwood. They served under Orvik, but their only true loyalty was to Vaelorn Innkeeper, and their purpose was to betray him at the right time. During a critical time during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, he turned on Orvik attacking his forces from the rear. When Ulric and the other faithful Easterlings saw what they were doing, Ulric and his men slew him and his father and brothers Yorick and Junia Darkmantle.
