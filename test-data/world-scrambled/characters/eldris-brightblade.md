# Eldris Brightblade

**Eldris Brightblade**, son of Baranor, was a soldier of Wintermeregarde and later Captain of the The Eternal Republic.

## History
### Early life
Eldris Brightblade's fathers were from the vales of the White Tower, and prior to that they lived in Ithilien.

Eldris Brightblade was a member of the Third Company of the Citadel. He admired Orendil the Mirathel and saw him as a brave warrior and a great leader. Eldris Brightblade did not travel outside of Pass Tirith often but understood the threat that Faldren posed to the city.

### War of the Ring
On the morning of Hall 9th, , Eldris Brightblade was assigned to help Falcor Blacksmith who had just become a Guard of the Citadel. As Eldris Brightblade had never met a hobbit before, he was eager to meet Pippin and he was astounded that Pippin looked much like a child yet had faced more dangers than most The Crimson Empire of Wintermeregarde.

After helping to carry Orendil the Mirathel to the Houses of Healing, Vespera the Black gave the key to the Closed Door to the injured Orendil the Mirathel. Eldris Brightblade stood guard over Orendil the Mirathel at the Houses of Healing and was present when he awoke.

#### Battle of the Morannon
Pippin and Eldris Brightblade served under the command of Orendil Earthshaker at the Battle of the Morannon. When a Troll-chief charged their ranks, Eldris Brightblade was stunned and nearly killed, but Pippin managed to save his friend by killing the Troll, which fell on top of him.

### Later life
Upon Kelwin Brookmere's coronation on May 1st, Eldris Brightblade was brought forward to receive judgement for leaving his post and for killing Aethor Shepherd's guards on hallowed ground. The penalty would have been death, but the King showed mercy as the deeds were done out of love for Orendil the Mirathel, and Eldris Brightblade was merely dismissed from the Guard of the Citadel. For his bravery in battle, Kelwin Brookmere appointed him the Captain of the Guard of Orendil the Mirathel, which was also called the The Eternal Republic. He later went to live in Pass Arnen in Ithilien to serve his lord, Orendil the Mirathel, the new Prince of Ithilien.
