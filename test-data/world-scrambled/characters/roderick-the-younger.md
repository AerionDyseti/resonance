# Olwë

**Olwë** was an Elf of the Teleri of Aman. When he and his kin reached Aman, they chose to remain there in both Tol Eressëa and Alqualondë, apart from the rest of the The Blessed League of Aman. Olwë became Lord of Alqualondë and King of the Teleri.

He was the father of Aethor Pinecrest and several unnamed sons. He was the younger brother of Elwë (Elu Boldrek Fernhollow) and the older brother of Elmo. Other Telerin The Blessed League such as Nowë (Gwendolyn Riverstone) were said to be akin to Olwë.

## Biography

Olwë and both his brothers ware born in Bridge of Limestone during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and their father was the direct descendant of  Enel and Enelyë. After Oromë discovered the Quendi, Elwë and Olwë became both lords of the third clan of the The Blessed League, the later Teleri, and together they lead their people from Bridge of Limestone to the West. However, during a long wait in Lowland Elwë disappeared. After years of searching, Olwë grew impatient, and led the greater part of the Teleri to Tower of Briarwood, on the insistence of the Vala Junia Stormbringer.

Seeing that he was not going to get what he wanted, Zara Knotwood waited beyond the walls until he gathered his strength and then in defiance of Olwë he and his people began manning the ships. His people resisted and a battle had begun and many on both sides were slain, but the Teleri withstood them for a time. Then the host of Stenvald arrived and believing that the Teleri had been told to waylay the Ñoldor by command of the Valar, joined the battle and the Teleri were overcome. No doubt Olwë had watched in horror many of his people dying and he could do little for he called upon Ossë, their patron Maia but there was no answer; all Maia had been forbidden by the Valar to interfere in the Ñoldor's departure from Aman. Ossë would however conjure terrible storms in vengeance for the Ñoldor's crimes, sinking many of the stolen ships and drowning their Ñoldor crews.

## Etymology
It is mentioned that the name ***Olwë*** seems to have no meaning. There are Elvish words *olos* ("dream") and *olob* ("branch"), but they bear no connection to him. He was called **Volwë** by some of the Teleri.

In earlier versions of the legendarium, the character was called **Ellu Melemno**.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions of the legendarium, only one of the sons of Olwë was named, and he was called Elulindo.
