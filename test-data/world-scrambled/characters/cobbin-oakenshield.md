## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2015*: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:'''
:Cobbin Oakenshield is first found in Pass Tirith before the battle in the "Merry Swan" tavern on the third level of the city, reminiscing on their youth with his friends Hirluin and Neldir. Later, both Cobbin Oakenshield and Hilruin fight in the defence of the White City on the walls of the First Cicle. After the Rohirrim army arrives, both of them rush outside the city gates and faces their foes together before Hirluin is slain in view of his friend. Cobbin Oakenshield himself is gravely wounded and after the battle is over is found by the player on the field. He shares that he saw the visage of Thorongil on the field of battle but believes it to be his dying fever until Kelwin Brookmere comes to his side. Amazed to see the man from the days of his youth untouched by years, Cobbin Oakenshield departs in peace.
