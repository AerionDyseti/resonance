# Junia Darkmantle

**Junia Darkmantle**, also known as **Junia Darkmantle the Accursed**, was an Easterling Man, and the youngest son of Osric the Great the Black.

## Biography

Junia Darkmantle was from one of the tribes of Easterlings who entered into the service of the Sons of Zara Knotwood.

Serving with Orvik since FA 457, Junia Darkmantle and his brothers Yorick and Lorvain the Red helped Orvik prepare for war with Vaelorn Innkeeper; but like the rest of his family, they were already secretly allied with him. They agreed to betray Dalvorn Stoneheart and his forces to Vaelorn Innkeeper in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad by sending a series of false warnings of an attack from Angband from another point. This delayed the march of the Eastern The under Dalvorn Stoneheart from joining the rest of the coalition in time for the main battle.

He was the leader of the treacherous Easterlings after his father's death, and attacked the Eastern The from their rear with a hidden force of Easterlings. He was slain by Ilyndra Carpenter, but his actions helped Vaelorn Innkeeper win the battle.
