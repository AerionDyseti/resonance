## Description

Young Dragonborn leading public healing rites in Granitekeepfell's Pebblebrookburg using water from a distant desert oasis.

## Overview

Earnest young Dragonborn healer revered as “The Anointer.” Charismatic but sincere, acting from faith rather than guile; his rites and amphora water catalyze the party’s investigation into the oasis source.

- Possessed an ornate Ring of Protection +1 inscribed in ancient Draconic.
- Surrounding supplies showed shadow‑induced decay; three vials of water remained unspoiled.
