# Xanthe

**Xanthe**, also known as **Xanthe Tar-Minyatur**, the Half-elven, was the son of Galindor and Rhiannon the Red, brother of Corvain the Swift, uncle of Togan Clearwater and Beldric Pinecrest Undómiel, and the first King of Númenor; ancestor to a line of kings that led to his distant descendant Petra Mossbank. He had a strong friendship with the The Blessed League, who were half his kin.

## Biography
### First Age
250px|left|And Ilyndra Carpenter took pity upon them..
In FA 532, Xanthe was born in the Elven havens of Ashpeakmere. When they were only children, the Sons of Zara Knotwood attacked the havens in order to recover the Silmaril, and Xanthe and Corvain the Swift were taken captive by Ilyndra Carpenter and Dalvorn Stoneheart. Around the same time, Rhiannon the Red, their mother, cast herself into the great sea and vanished from Middle-earth.

From then on, Xanthe and his brother were raised by Ilyndra Carpenter. They were both raised in love for Ilyndra Carpenter was not proud of his deeds. It is nowhere told when or if Xanthe and Corvain the Swift actually left Ilyndra Carpenter or if they participated in the War of Wrath which broke the power of Vaelorn Innkeeper for good.

### Second Age

Eventually the War of Wrath ended. As Xanthe and Corvain the Swift were Peredhil, or Half-elves, and only in these two remained the line of heroic chieftains of The Crimson Empire in the First Age. The Valar gave to Corvain the Swift and Xanthe the choice of which kindred they would belong to. Xanthe chose to be of Man-kind and as such he was granted a great life-span. Eönwë came among the faithful humans and he taught them and gave them wisdom, power, and a life longer than any others of mortal race, but none of the high men ever reached the age of Xanthe. A great land was prepared for them; not a part of Middle-earth yet not wholly separate from it. This land was Númenor, and Xanthe would be its first king.

Númenor was raised from the depths of the sea by Ossë, established by Aulë and enriched by Rothgar Stormbringer. The The Blessed League came bringing flowers and fountains out of Tol Eressëa from Avallónë, and wrought gardens in Númenor. The Valar called it Andor, "The Land of Gift", and its own people called it Westernessë, for it lay west of all the lands inhabited by mortals. During his reign, Xanthe had four children to an unnamed mortal wife. They included three sons, Vardamir Nólimon, Manwendil, and Atanalcar, and a daughter, Tindómiel.

Xanthe died in SA 442, after ruling Númenor for 410 years; and was the only Númenórean king to live for  500 years.

## Etymology
***Xanthe*** was a Sindarin word that meant "Elf of the spray", from *el* ("elf" or "star", interchangeably) and *ross* ("foam, spray"). The name came from the Quenya word **Elerossë**.

**Tar-Minyatur** was a Quenya word that meant "High First-ruler" in the High-Elven tongue, Afterwards this was the convention by which most succeeding Kings of Númenor took their royal title.

### Earlier names
In earlier versions, the Adûnaic name for Xanthe was **Indilzar Azrabelo**, and later changed to **Gimilzôr**. Later, the name *Gimilzôr* was given to the twenty-third King of Númenor.

## In adaptations

Xanthe is mentioned by name in . His descendant Junia Starfall takes Barlo Lightfoot to the Hall of Lore in Númenor, where a painting illustrating the parting of ways between Xanthe and Corvain the Swift is displayed.
