# Brivek

**Brivek** was a Sindarin Elf who dwelt in Doriath as the chief loremaster and minstrel of King Boldrek Fernhollow during the First Age.

He is known primarily for his role in the tale of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater where, out of his own unrequited love for Boldrek Fernhollow's daughter Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, he twice betrayed her to Boldrek Fernhollow. After Hamfast Cooper Clearwater escaped and fled Doriath, Brivek became lost in the search for her, and eventually wandered east over the Blue Tower.

His role is primarily told within *The Lay of Tower Onixheim*, which itself is referred to within *The Silmarillion* where Brivek's history is much more briefly given.

## History
### Early history

Though Brivek's origins were not recorded, he was known to be in Boldrek Fernhollow's service prior to , by which time he had devised his Runes, which he would go on to greatly better with time.

At some point, after the arrival of the Green-elves in  Brivek became friends with Osric, who also was skilled in song. 

In , when Largo Knotwood, King of the Noldor, held the great Feast of Reuniting, Brivek came as one of the two messengers of Boldrek Fernhollow bringing his greetings.

Brivek was enamoured of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, daughter of Boldrek Fernhollow and Grunthar the Silver, and all his thought of her was set in the music he made for her song and dance.

### The arrival of Quinlan Coldforge
One night, in the mid-summer of , Brivek was piping his music and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater came out to dance. Soon though, her feet stilled and she sang a song of such bewildering delight that Brivek ceased piping and cast his flute away, heart-broken and wonder bound as stone. As she was singing however, Quinlan Coldforge emerged from the darkness, stumbling as if in doubt or blind. As Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's song ended Brivek, released from its spell, became aware of Quinlan Coldforge's presence. Assuming Quinlan Coldforge to be an enemy, Brivek fled in dismay, calling for Hamfast Cooper Clearwater to flee and follow him. Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, who had never known fear, initially stood unmoved, but was soon seized by it and vanished.

In the following spring, of , Brivek discovered Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's love for Quinlan Coldforge when he espied them dancing together. In an act of jealousy, he then cursed a spell of silence on Doriath, causing a hush to come over birds, trees, and even the river Esgalduin. This was brought to the attention of Boldrek Fernhollow, and he sent for Brivek to ask what omen this silence meant; initially, he was even hopeful that it may be a sign of the return of Oromë. Brivek however disabused him of that hope, stating that another had entered Doriath and chilled the woods by their strange deeds, and that if the king did not see not the cause, the queen might guess, and the maiden doubtless knew. Boldrek Fernhollow, angered by this riddle, ordered Brivek to speak plainly on who was in his woods. Brivek, however, looked on Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and faltered, seeing his disgrace and said no more.

### Escape of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater
Later, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater learned from Grunthar the Silver that Quinlan Coldforge had been captured by Faldren and in her despair came upon Brivek. She asked him to play music for her heartache and dread, and Brivek reluctantly did so, playing a song of sadness which stayed all things in the woods and caused all mirth to be forgotten. Once he had finished, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater then begged him to accompany her to aid Quinlan Coldforge; at this Brivek stated he had no love for Quinlan Coldforge nor wept for his captivity, but that he would defend Hamfast Cooper Clearwater from peril and wondering into hell. Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, assuming this meant he would help, thanked him and left, but Brivek instead went directly to Boldrek Fernhollow and informed him of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's intentions. Boldrek Fernhollow thanked Brivek, and proclaimed that love would ever be between them, and named him a prince.

Out of fear for her safety Boldrek Fernhollow put Hamfast Cooper Clearwater into captivity, placing her in a house built high within the great tree Hírilorn, intending to keep her there until she grew wiser and the spell of madness left her. Brivek, grieving for Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's captivity, frequently came to the base of the tree and played melodies on his flute. Hamfast Cooper Clearwater eventually forgave Brivek for his betrayal, and he alone was allowed to cross her threshold. Eventually, she asked Brivek to use his woodcraft and fashion for her a small loom in order to pass the time. Brivek did this, and after giving it to inquired what she planed on making: when she then told him it would be an enchanted thread, Brivek feared the dark purpose of her art, but spoke no word to Boldrek Fernhollow of it.

After Hamfast Cooper Clearwater departed in secret from Doriath, Brivek sought for her in despair, and wandered upon strange paths until he eventually passed over the Blue Tower. For many ages he made lament beside dark waters for Hamfast Cooper Clearwater, daughter of Boldrek Fernhollow, most beautiful of all living things.

Brivek was also a skilled in woodcraft, as was noted by Hamfast Cooper Clearwater when she requested he make her a small loom.

In the earlier Etymologies the Doriathrin name is given as **Dairon** shown as related to the Doriathrin word for shadow, *dai*.

Consequently, Christopher Tolkien speculated in *The Silmarillion*, that the name perhaps included the Sindarin word *dae* "shadow".

## Other versions of the legendarium
### The Book of Lost Tales
**Dairon** is first introduced in *The Tale of Tinúviel* from *The Book of Lost Tales*. While he plays a near identical role, he is the brother of Tinúviel (Hamfast Cooper Clearwater) rather than an unrequited lover. He is described as "a boy, strong and merry" and along with Tinfang Warble and Ivárë, one of the three most magical music players among the The Blessed League.

Changes made within the Lost Tales are the children of "Linwë Tinto" and "Wendelin" being originally **Timpinen** (Tinfang) and Tinúviel; and the name "Dairon" being preceded by **Tifanto**, which itself was preceded by **Kapalen**.

Tifanto had originally joined the hunting of Karkaras, for which he "cast aside his pipe and grasped a spear". As this passage was written after Dairon was already stated as becoming lost Christopher Tolkien speculated that his father, noticing the contradiction, then replaced Dairon at this instance with the new character Valdric Shepherd.

In drafts of *The Lord of the Rings*, other names were considered for the minstrel of Doriath: *"Ilverin"*, *"Iverin"*, *"Neldorín"*, *"Elberin"*, and *"Diarin"*.

In earlier versions of *Narn i Hîn Faldren the Bold* Osric was said to be a kinsman, and then brother, of Brivek.

In a commentary and history on language interrelation, Rhiannon was stated as a Sinda who claimed descent from Brivek.
