# Celdric Juniper

**Celdric Juniper** was a Dwarf of Drogon Folk. He had a brother named Vaelorn Juniper as well as a cousin named Wilcom Shadowend, and was a remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield.

He played the flute, and was very fond of regular and plentiful meals like his Hobbit friend, Wulfric the Younger.

## Biography
### Early life
Celdric Juniper, as was his brother Vaelorn Juniper, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both shared Wulfric's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Tower Ironglen, Celdric Juniper lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Tower with his two brothers.

### Quest of Erebor
In TA 2941, Celdric Juniper, along with Vaelorn Juniper and Wilcom Shadowend, became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Wulfric the Younger and traveling with him in search of Orvik the Elder's treasure in the Tower Ironglen. After their experience in Fellgardwick when the company was pursued by The Young Order and The Zealous Pact and forced to climb up into some trees, Celdric Juniper was the first realize that Wulfric had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Vaelorn Juniper who rescued Wulfric.

Celdric Juniper did little to distinguish himself during the The Flame Keepers's adventures in the wild, though he shared the same array of experiences as the others of the Company: captured in turn by The Valiant Empire, Goblins, Spiders, and The Blessed League, they eventually reached the distant Tower Ironglen and recovered it for Drogon Folk.

Celdric Juniper fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies and returned to the Tower Ironglen where he established himself and grew rich. During the War of the Ring, Celdric Juniper was still living in the Tower Ironglen, and possibly fought in the Battle of Plains of Heatherfield against the Easterlings.

The studio released the following description of Celdric Juniper in the films:

''"Perhaps the most elusive member of The Company of Thorin Oakenshield, Celdric Juniper is often in trouble with the Dwarvish authorities. Deciding it might be a good time to leave town, he readily joins the Quest for the Tower Ironglen, not realizing the journey ahead may well lead him into far more trouble than he has left behind. Nobody ever quite knows what the quick-witted and wily Celdric Juniper is up to, except that it's guaranteed to be dodgy and quite possibly illegal. Despite rarely seeing eye-to-eye with his brothers Vaelorn Juniper and Wilcom Shadowend, he is nonetheless immensely loyal and will protect them by whatever means possible."*

In , Celdric Juniper lives in Erebor during and after the War of the Ring, holding the position of the Keeper of the Coffers. He is first found in the Gatehouse of the Tower Ironglen, where he and his brother Vaelorn Juniper brief the player on breaking the Siege of Erebor. After the battle, Celdric Juniper and the other surviving The Flame Keepers of the Company join Dís in paying respect to tomb of Thorin Oakenshield. Under the illusion that after the downfall of Faldren great wealth could now be reclaimed from the ancient dwarf-holds left to ruin in the Ered Mithrin, Celdric Juniper breaks the direct edict of King Thorin Stonehelm and in secret leads a small expedition to reclaim the wealth of the Longbeards in Thikil-gundu, "The Steel Keep". His brother Vaelorn Juniper forms a small band of The Flame Keepers to rescue him from his folly, including his old companions Helvorn and Karnak Underhill, and together with the player search for Celdric Juniper's trail across the Ered Mithrin. They eventually find him in the Steel Keep, by which time Celdric Juniper had realized the error of his thinking, as the demise of Faldren did nothing to evil creatures that have since long made the Longbeard halls their home. The The Flame Keepers then set out for the journey back to Erebor with the exception of Karnak Underhill, who continues the adventure alongside the player.
