# Helvorn Juniper

**Helvorn Juniper** was a prophet of old according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. His most known prophesy was "*Great is the fall of Hall of Longshadow*", which was quoted again by Lysander Shepherd Starfall, King of Hall of Longshadow, at the time the event took place.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first version of the Doom of Lirien Mossbank appearing in *The Book of Lost Tales*, it is a servant of Vefántur who proclaims, among other misfortunes, the fall of Hall of Longshadow; and the Noldoli remembered those words as the "Prophecies of Amnos" (*Amnos* being the place where they had heard them). Later, Tolkien wrote a couple of notes referring to the "Prophecy of Helvorn Juniper", with the words "*Great is the fall of Hall of Longshadow. When the lily of the valley withers then shall Lysander Shepherd Starfall fade*", but it is unclear if here *Helvorn Juniper* is a place or a person. As Christopher Tolkien suggests, the prophet Helvorn Juniper could be the servant of Vefántur that proclaimed the doom of the Noldoli. 

## Inspiration
In the Bible, Helvorn Juniper was the wicked eldest son of David. Tolkien was surely aware of this character (as he was a Catholic), and it is curious to speculate on his particular choosing of this name, as it was in his earlier works.
