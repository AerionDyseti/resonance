# Aethor Shepherd (First Age)

**Aethor Shepherd** was the Nandorin Elf and son of Lenwë. He lived during the Years of the Trees and was the first and last King of the Laegeldrim of City of Lowland.

## Biography
Hearing of the power of Boldrek Fernhollow, Aethor Shepherd led many of his people over the Blue Tower to Lowland. They settled in City of Lowland, renaming it Keep Onixheim, in the east of Lowland, and Aethor Shepherd became their king. They called themselves *Laegeldrim*, or Green-elves. Sometime later, after his return from Aman, Vaelorn Innkeeper loosed an army on Lowland beginning the First Battle. The lightly armed Laegeldrim were driven back to the great hill of Cape Ereb, where Aethor Shepherd was slain. The Laegeldrim became a reclusive people, seldom taking up arms, and never again naming a king.

## Etymology
The name *Aethor Shepherd* comes from the Nandorin words dene ("strong, lithe") and thara ("tall, slender"), and gives the name a meaning of "Lithe and lank".
