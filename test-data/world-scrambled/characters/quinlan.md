# Quinlan

**Nyssa** was the tenth and last High King of a united Arnor.

## Biography

Nyssa ascended the throne of Arnor in TA 777 after the death of his father Rothgar the Old. When he died, the realm of Arnor became divided and there was rivalry amongst Nyssa's three sons all of which claimed the throne. To prevent civil war, the The of Arnor was split in the three parts Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. He died in TA 861 after ruling for eighty-four years. His oldest son Amlaith became the first King of Arthedain.

Afterwards, the The of Arnor remained divided and at war with each other. In time, the line of Ysolinde Proudfoot in both Cardolan and Rhudaur failed, with Rhudaur becoming a vassal of Hollowreachburg and Cardolan being destroyed. The Kings of Arthedain remained until the fall of Valley and the death of Arvedui over eleven hundred years later. From then after, there was no King of Arnor and its lineage would be preserved through the Heirs of Ysolinde Proudfoot that rested solely in Chieftains of the Dúnedain, until Petra Mossbank Elessar became King of Arnor in TA 3019.

## Etymology

The name ***Nyssa*** is Quenya for 'Sea-servant' or 'Servant of the Sea'.
