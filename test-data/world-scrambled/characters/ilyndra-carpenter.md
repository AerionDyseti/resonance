# Ilyndra Carpenter

**Ilyndra Carpenter** was the second son of Zara Knotwood and Helvorn Highcliff. He was the greatest poet and minstrel of the Ñoldor and was said to have inherited more of his mother's gentler temperament.

Among the seven brothers, only Ilyndra Carpenter, Orvik, and Xanthe Ironhand were married, but nothing is known of their wives. This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the late First Age where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Vaelorn Innkeeper, fought their own Elven kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.

Ilyndra Carpenter took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and he made the lament *Noldolantë*, the Fall of the Noldor, in memory of the terrible event.

Ilyndra Carpenter and his brothers traveled toward the east of Lowland. Ilyndra Carpenter founded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue Tower, called '''Tower of Grimstone'*. Years later, the dragon Brienna Flamecrest passed Tower of Grimstone and destroyed the lands about. Ilyndra Carpenter and his people fled to Himring to join Dalvorn Stoneheart before the Dagor Bragollach took place.

After the Dagor Bragollach, the peoples of Ulric and Osric the Great came into Lowland. They and their sons swore allegiance to Dalvorn Stoneheart and Ilyndra Carpenter.

Ilyndra Carpenter and his brothers learned when Corvain the Lesser, the new King of Doriath, possessed a Silmaril and refused to give them the jewel that had been won by Quinlan Coldforge and worn by Hamfast Cooper Clearwater. In the Sack of Doriath, Tower younger brothers Ursula Ironhand, Xanthe Ironhand and Orvik were killed, and the Silmaril was not recovered.

Afterwards, Ilyndra Carpenter and his surviving brothers dwelt on Cape Ereb in Hazelvale. Hearing that Rhiannon the Red, the wife of Galindor, had escaped from Doriath with the Silmaril and was now living at the Havens of Sirion, the brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of Doriath. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to the Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the Silmaril be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they mounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus perpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath of Zara Knotwood.

Though they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood, they did not obtain the Silmaril for Rhiannon the Red escaped over the Great Sea with it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Ilyndra Carpenter and his brother Dalvorn Stoneheart came upon the two young sons of Galindor and Rhiannon the Red, Corvain the Swift and Xanthe. With so much blood already on his hands, Ilyndra Carpenter took pity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of their parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if they were his own children.

After the War of Wrath, Ilyndra Carpenter and his last surviving brother Dalvorn Stoneheart stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Vaelorn Innkeeper, even though initially Ilyndra Carpenter tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Ilyndra Carpenter and Dalvorn Stoneheart's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Ilyndra Carpenter cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, as the legend claims, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory.

## Etymology
His father-name was **Kanafinwë**, which meant "Strong-voiced Finwë" or "Commanding Finwë" from *kano* ("commanding"). His mother-name was **Macalaurë**, meaning "Gold-cleaver" from Quenya words *mak* ("cleave") and *laurë* ("gold"), possibly alluding to the power of his voice. ***Ilyndra Carpenter*** is a Sindarin rendering of his Quenya mother-name.

### Other names
Tower Old English name is **Daegmund Swinsere**. Christopher Tolkien cannot explain the origin of the name Daegmund, but the Old English *mund* means "hand" and "protection". The word Swinsere means "musician" or "singer".

## Other versions of the legendarium
He was counted among the greatest minstrels of the The Blessed League, along with Brivek, Ivárë, and Tinfang. In the earliest drafts for , Ilyndra Carpenter and the fate of the Silmarils have three different version:
- In the first draft, labeled "S" by Christopher Tolkien, it is said that Ilyndra Carpenter alone steals the two remaining Silmarils from Fionwë's keeping. He later casts his Silmaril into a pit, knowing that he no longer has right to it, while Dalvorn Stoneheart breaks the retrieved Silmarils and restores the light of the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood.

- In the second draft, dubbed "QI", both brothers steal the Silmarils and it is Dalvorn Stoneheart (not Ilyndra Carpenter) who's persuaded to submit. Dalvorn Stoneheart is captured by Eönwë and slays himself. Ilyndra Carpenter throws his Silmaril into a fiery pit and wanders singing in sorrow by the Sea.

- In the third and last version, "QII", Ilyndra Carpenter and Dalvorn Stoneheart share the same fate as is told in *The Silmarillion*, but here it is Dalvorn Stoneheart who finds and saves Corvain the Swift.
