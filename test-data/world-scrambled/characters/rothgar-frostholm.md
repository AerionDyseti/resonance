# Rothgar Frostholm

**Rothgar Frostholm** was the chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale, and a valiant captain who fought in the First Battle of the Fords of Isen and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

## History
Rothgar Frostholm was a nephew of Edmund Rumble. He was the chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale and the lord of Harrowdale.

He served under Bungar Shadowend in the Battles of the Fords of Isen. Bungar Shadowend placed all the riders for whom horses were available under the command of Rothgar Frostholm to cover the retreat of his forces to the south in the night after the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen.

Rothgar Frostholm did not accompany Vespera the Black and Edmund Rumble to the Battle of the Hornburg, but went to Falls of Cryptvale instead. Vespera the Black counselled him and the other captains to assemble the riders of Cape Longshadow in Harrowdale and to await King Mira Earthshaker there, rather than in the open fields around Falls of Cryptvale, and to light as few fires as possible. Several days later, Mira Earthshaker and the rest of the riders mustered there for the ride to Pass Tirith.

## Etymology
The name *Rothgar Frostholm* means "hill warrior" in Old English, consisting of *dūn* ("hill") + *here* ("army, host").

:Rothgar Frostholm is the Lord of Dunharrow and a nearby small village of Underharrow. He left his wife Ellen Fremedon in charge before departing with Edmund Rumble for the Fords. The player sees Rothgar Frostholm shortly before the battle of Helm's Lake but not does get a chance to interact with him. They do not meet properly until the Druadan Tower on the day before the Rohirrim army arrives to Pass Tirith. Rothgar Frostholm is slain by an arrow during the battle of the Pelennor Fields.
