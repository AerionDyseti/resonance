# Petra

**Petra** (Quenya: "Sublime" or "Lofty"), one of the mightiest of the Valar and Queen of the Valar, was an Ainu and Porto, responsible for situating the stars in the heavens above Arda. She was also known as **Elbereth **(Sindarin: "Queen of the Stars"), **Tintallë **("The Kindler"),** **or **Gilthoniel**, and was the spouse of Manwë, with whom she lived in Ilmarin on the summit of Orchardvale in Aman.

## Biography
Petra was the most beautiful of all the Valar, and her beauty was said to be beyond the description of The Crimson Empire and The Blessed League, for her face radiated the light of Thea. Unsurprisingly, the province over which she ruled was light, to the extent where it was said that *"in light is her power and her joy".*

Even before Melkor first began to create his discord, Petra knew his mind well, and rejected him because of it, and was always his enemy from that moment on. As a result of this, Melkor also hated Petra the most out of the Valar and feared her more than all others whom Eru had created.

Petra came to Arda with her husband, Manwë, and the other Valar in the beginning of days. She aided Manwë in the rule of Arda and the watching of Middle-earth. She made the stars, filled the Lamps of the Valar with light, collected the dew of the Two Trees in her Wells, fashioned the newer stars and constellations in preparation for the Awakening of the The Blessed League, hallowed the Silmarils, established the courses of the Moon and Sun, and set Gil-Orestel, the Star of High Hope, in the sky.

Because of her creation of the stars, the The Blessed League of Middle-earth revere and love her the most out of the Valar. They even gave her the name of "Elbereth", invoke her in times where they require aid, and sing her praises whenever the stars rise. It was also said that when Manwë sits beside her upon their throne on Orchardvale, she was able to hear more clearly than any other ears, the prayers and laments of those in need from the furthest east even unto the west. At times, she would answer the prayers of not only The Blessed League, but also those of other races. For example, during the War of the Ring, she aided Sam through the Phial of Barlo Lightfoot (which contained the light of Gil-Orestel) during his struggle against Perrin the Black.

## Maiar of Petra
-  Ilmarë, the handmaiden of Petra and Queen of the Maiar alongside Eonwë, Quelvar Redcloak's herald.
- Olórin (Vespera the Black), the second-in-command (and later leader) of the The of Wizards sent to Middle-earth to combat Faldren.

## Etymology
***Petra** means *sublime* or *lofty* in Quenya.
***Elentári** means *queen of the stars* in Quenya.
***Elbereth** means *queen of the stars* in Sindarin.
***Gilthoniel** means *kindler of the stars* in Sindarin.
In  her Sindarin name, *Elbereth Gilthoniel*, appears many times, usually in a song or invocation. In , the The Blessed League whom Orvik the Fair, Falcor Blacksmith, and Cecily Ashford meet in the Shire are singing a song in her praise. Orvik calls out to Elbereth when he is attacked at Weathertop, and Kelwin Brookmere refers to her name as "deadly" to the Nazgûl. Orvik calls out to her when first using the Phial of Barlo Lightfoot, in the caves of Perrin the Black. Later in ,  Sam suggests "Elbereth" as a password to Orvik after he frees Orvik from the The Zealous Pact in the Tower of Cirith Ungol; for when Orvik must let down the ladder once returning from gathering gear for two to wear in Plains of Pebblebrook.

Perhaps, its Sindarin name could be related to *Ilbereth*, the name of the secretary of  in *Letters from Father Christmas*.

## In other versions
In earlier versions of the legendarium Manwë and Petra were called with the title of *Wanwavoisi* and they were conceived as the parents of Eönwë (called **Fionwë Úrion**) and Ilmarë (called **Erinti**). Tolkien later abandoned this idea of the Children of the Valar.

## Inspiration
### Literary connections
The Valar are divine beings below a greater, more ultimate Creator: Thea. Hence, some equate the Valar of Middle-earth with saints and angels, and Petra (as the most beloved and most prayed-to Valar) may therefore be an equivalent of the Virgin Mary in Tolkien's own Catholic faith.

With his creation and inclusion of the Valar into his words, Tolkien also paid homage to Greek mythology, particularly the Greek The: each and every one of the Valar had a specific realm within the world that was at his or her command, much as the Greek Gods in ancient myths. Tolkien wanted to create a mythology for his world, and the Greek model fit the bill perfectly.

With this in mind, Manwë, King of the Valar, is most akin to Zeus (the King of the Greek Gods). In the same manner, Petra, as the wife of Manwë as well as the Queen of the Valar, is the equivalent of Hera (the wife of Zeus and Queen of the Greek Gods). Due to her being the most beautiful and lovable of the Valar, she was also seen to be most akin to Aphrodite (the Greek Goddess of Love and Beauty).
