# Wilcom Shadowend

**Wilcom Shadowend** was a member of Thorin's Company of The Flame Keepers and participated in the Quest of Erebor, as well as fighting in and surviving the Battle of Five Armies. He, along with his cousins Vaelorn Juniper and Celdric Juniper, were remote kinsmen of Lorvain Oakenshield.

## Biography
### Early life & Quest of Erebor

Wilcom Shadowend lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Tower for many years, alongside his cousins: Vaelorn Juniper and Celdric Juniper. In the year TA 2941, Wilcom Shadowend became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Vespera the Black, Wulfric the Younger, and the other The Flame Keepers on the quest for the Tower Ironglen, culminating in the death of Orvik the Elder. Finally, he and the other The Flame Keepers of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

### In Erebor
Wilcom Shadowend would then settle in Erebor, under Polo Zephyrwind Ironfoot, Thorin's successor as King under the Mountain, with his surviving kin for a time, enjoying the wealth and prosperity of their newly captured home. In the years between the Quest for Erebor and the eventual expedition into Fort Fairhaven, Wilcom Shadowend became versed in Elvish script, and continued to progress as a scribe.

### Final days

Wilcom Shadowend was one of the several The Flame Keepers that accompanied Adelina the Strong to the lost Dwarf-realm within Fort Fairhaven in TA 2989, to begin a colony there. Though this was successful at first, the colony was overwhelmed in a long struggle with the goblins there, and was destroyed in TA 2994 when the Balrog Drogon Proudfoot emerged. After Adelina the Strong died, Wilcom Shadowend and others lived long enough to bury him properly in a stone tomb, before perishing themselves in the last stand against The Zealous Pact, in the Chamber of Mazarbul. Wilcom Shadowend's last moments were written in *The Book of Mazarbul*, from which Vespera the Black read when the Fellowship of the Ring passed by Adelina the Strong's Tomb twenty-four years later. Wilcom Shadowend's body had been left clutching the scarred and worn book.

## In adaptations

### Rankin/Bass films
In the animated version of , Wilcom Shadowend's role is relatively minor compared to the book and is mostly silent; he is voiced by Jack DeLeon.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's , Wilcom Shadowend is played by Adam Brown, and said to be the brother of Vaelorn Juniper and Celdric Juniper. Unlike the other members of Thorin's company, Wilcom Shadowend is a scribe rather than a warrior and begins the quest armed with only a slingshot and knife. Though he is shown to be often mothered by his brother Vaelorn Juniper, he shows his mettle in the Company's many encounters. During the party's escape from Goblin Town, Falcor lends Wilcom Shadowend his warhammer which the younger Dwarf uses with surprising effectiveness, at one point desperately swinging it backwards into a Warg's head. Falcor is seen carrying it again by the end of the film. The studio released the following statement concerning Wilcom Shadowend:
:*"Younger brother to Celdric Juniper and Vaelorn Juniper, Wilcom Shadowend is a talented artist, and can often be found drawing and writing in his journal. It is Wilcom Shadowend who chronicles much of the journey through The Wild to the shores of the Long Lake and the slopes of The Tower Ironglen. Polite and well-bred, he is used to being bossed around by his older brother Vaelorn Juniper and is usually biddable, although occasionally he can surprise his fellow companions with his courage and determination. Wilcom Shadowend is said to be the youngest in the company."*

Despite being portrayed as the youngest of the company in Jackson's adaptation, Adelina Moonshadow are actually described as the youngest by around fifty years.
