# Gareth Wheelwright

**Gareth Wheelwright** was a Petty-dwarf and was the son of Petra Elmsworth and brother of Arveth Shadowmend.

## Biography

He was captured with his father and brother by Xander the Great's outlaw band in the First Age. During the Sack of Cape Rûdh, he was missing in action. He might have been killed by an Orc or might have died of an accident, like his brother. But, after the destruction of Cape Rudh, Gareth Wheelwright was never seen again, and would have died, as Tolkien states that Petra Elmsworth was ultimately the "last" of the Petty-dwarves.

## Background
In *The Children of Hurin* and *Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth*, Gareth Wheelwright is last mentioned being held hostage by the The Zealous Pact that Petra Elmsworth had aligned himself with, but he is never mentioned again.
