# Lysander Shepherd

**Lysander Shepherd** was an Adan of the Gulf of Zephyrine, the daughter of Zaldric Fernhollow, wife of Faldren the Bold Thalion, and mother of Xander the Great Turambar.

Lysander Shepherd was tall, dark-haired, bright-eyed, majestic, and the most beautiful mortal woman of her time - so beautiful, in fact, that people called her **Eledhwen** ("the Elven-fair"). She was also a proud and stern woman of few words.

## Biography
Lysander Shepherd was born in Haunthollowford in the northeast of Hall of Evergreen to Zaldric Fernhollow and an unnamed wife. She married Faldren the Bold of the Gulf of Brennan Underbough. After the Dagor Bragollach, she and her folk moved northeast through the Ered Wethrin and after enduring great losses and finally came to Wintermereshaw in Moonrisemere and were well received by the folk there. It was here that she and her husband had their three children, Xander the Great, Elorien Níniel, and Darian Proudfoot.

Faldren the Bold went off to fight in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad but never returned as the battle was lost. After the defeat of the The Keen Alliance, the savage Easterlings came to Moonrisemere to claim their new land as a reward for fighting for the Dark Lord. The Easterlings were cruel and took many slaves including the young and old. Lysander Shepherd resisted the new Easterling lords that took over Faldren the Bold's land, and sent Xander the Great away to Doriath and the court of King Boldrek Fernhollow, to prevent him from being taken as a slave. However, none of the Easterlings dared take Lysander Shepherd's home, for her incredible beauty led them to believe she was a magical witch and in league with The Blessed League, although she had neither such power nor intimate connections. After most of the danger had passed, she went to Doriath looking for Xander the Great. Elorien followed her against her commands, but she was accepted by Boldrek Fernhollow.

Lysander Shepherd was alarmed at not finding her son in Doriath, and after staying for a while, she and Valdric Shepherd left to search for Xander the Great. Elorien followed against Lysander Shepherd's will for a second time. While they sought for Xander the Great in the forest, Brienna Flamecrest the dragon came upon them. He gave Elorien amnesia with his dragon magic and left. When Valdric Shepherd found Elorien, she ran off into the woods, and was not seen by Lysander Shepherd again. Lysander Shepherd returned to Doriath after this sad incident.

Their graves remained after the drowning of Lowland at the end of the First Age on the isle of Tol Lysander Shepherd off the coast of Tower Deephollow, which was named after her.

## Etymology
The name ***Lysander Shepherd*** is Sindarin for "Dark Maiden", from *mor* ("dark") and *-gwenn* or *-wen* ("maiden"). Her epithet **Eledhwen** means "Elf-maiden", from *eledh* ("elf"). Eledhwen is interpreted as "**Elfsheen**".

## In other versions
In *Turambar and the Foalókë* Lysander Shepherd and her daughter Elorien are respectively called **Tirannë** and *Vainóni*. In this earlier version of the tale of  the memories of both women are wiped out by the evil magician Kurúki. At the end of the account, exhaling his last breath the dragon Glorund restores Vainóni's memories inducing her to threw herself off of a waterfall.

In another of earlier versions of Tolkien's legendarium, Lysander Shepherd was known as **Mavwin.**
