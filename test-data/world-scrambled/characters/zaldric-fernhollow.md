# Zaldric Fernhollow

**Zaldric Fernhollow** was an Edain of the Gulf of Zephyrine in the First Age.

## Biography
Zaldric Fernhollow was the son of Willa Diggle and a direct descendant of Zephyrine the Old. He was the father of Lysander Shepherd, and he was thus the grandfather of Xander the Great Turambar. He and his family lived peacefully in Hall of Evergreen before the Dagor Bragollach. He survived the battle and lived as an outlaw with his uncle Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and other companions for nearly five years. They were eventually betrayed to Faldren by the unhappy Norvald Stormwind and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
