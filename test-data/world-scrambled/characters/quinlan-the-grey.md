AI summary: Quinlan the Grey, a Dro'adi Monk from Gulf Shæbridin, experiences significant visions during the Heroes for Hire campaign, realizing that a catastrophic event must occur to return home. Trained under Longo Shadowmend, Quinlan navigates complex political landscapes and successfully leads the party while grappling with the implications of their journey and the cost of returning to Vrasillex.

## Overview

Dro'adi Monk (Way of Mercy), one of the player characters in the Heroes for Hire campaign. Native to Vrasillex and member of Gulf Shæbridin, one of the thirteen ruling matriarchal houses.

## Naming Convention

- **Given Name**: Quinlan
- **Gulf Name**: Shæbridin
- Gulf Shæbridin is one of the thirteen ruling matriarchal houses of Vrasillex

## Time Pool Visions (Session 9)

### Present (Medium Pool)

Saw Longo Shadowmend training in the present.

### Future (Fast Pool)

Saw a war-weary, scarred, hardened version of themselves wearing armor and wielding weapons of human make (which they did not recognize—also from the future).

## The Crucial Realization

Quinlan made the crucial Arcana check in Session 9, putting together the pieces:

- The explosion at the Gates of Edgewood echoes backward and forward through time
- The party rode that shockwave to arrive in the Age of Mythology
- **The only way back is to be at the epicenter when the impact happens**
- Therefore, the catastrophe cannot be stopped if they want to return home

## Background

Trained at the Monastery of the Gates Dance under Longo Shadowmend. The return to Vrasillex is particularly significant given their status as a member of one of the ruling houses.

## Campaign Highlights

### Heroes for Hire

- Escaped Ataniisti capture with Galdor Mugwort and Brienna the Golden
- Led the party to Vrasillex, invoking house connections for protection
- Successfully navigated Dro'adi law and politics to secure Galdor Mugwort's protection
