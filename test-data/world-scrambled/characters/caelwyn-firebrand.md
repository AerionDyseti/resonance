# Caelwyn Firebrand

**Caelwyn Firebrand** was the second-youngest of the seven sons of Zara Knotwood, son of Finwë.

## Biography

Caelwyn Firebrand and his younger brother, Rothgar, were born during the Years of the Trees in Tower of Briarwood. In the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Caelwyn Firebrand and his brothers swore the Oath of Zara Knotwood. Before they left for Middle-earth, Helvorn Highcliff Caelwyn Firebrand's mother begged Zara Knotwood to leave her two youngest son with him or at least one of them. Zara Knotwood refused her, and Helvorn Highcliff prophesied that one of them will not set foot on Middle-earth. In fact, Caelwyn Firebrand died during the Burning of the ships at Nightveil.

In accordance to , Caelwyn Firebrand and his six brothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. He had also held the lands of Fort Cryptvale with his brother. In FA 538, Stenvald Bracegirdle died during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion.

## Etymology
Caelwyn Firebrand's father-name was **Telufinwë**, meaning "Last Finwë", most likely from Quenya *tella* ("hindmost, last"). The short form of this name is **Telvo**. Originally, his mother-name was **Ambarussa**, "Top-russet", from *amba* ("upwards"). When Zara Knotwood insisted on different names for the twins, Helvorn Highcliff named Caelwyn Firebrand **Umbarto**, "the Fated". Zara Knotwood later changed it to **Ambarto**, "Upwards-exalted", from *amba* and *arta* ("exalted, lofty"). eventually a name for someone else.

In Old English, Caelwyn Firebrand's name is ***Deormod*** "the Brave-hearted".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In , when arriving in Middle-earth, Zara Knotwood had roused his sons to burn the ships. Yet in the morning, Rothgar noticed the absence of his twin brother Caelwyn Firebrand and asked for him. Rothgar explained to his father Zara Knotwood that Caelwyn Firebrand did not sleep on the ground in great discomfort but slept instead in one of the ships. Then in great dread, Zara Knotwood perceived that his son Caelwyn Firebrand had wished to sail back and rejoin his mother Helvorn Highcliff in Tower of Briarwood but the ships had all been burnt now with his son in one of them. Thus sadly, Caelwyn Firebrand perished there in Nightveil when the ships had been set to fire by the command of his father. And none dared to speak to Zara Knotwood about this matter afterward.

It was mentioned that Caelwyn Firebrand and his twin brother Rothgar remained alike, but eventually Caelwyn Firebrand, the elder of the two, grew darker in hair. It was also said that among his twin-sons, Zara Knotwood held Caelwyn Firebrand to be more dear to him.
