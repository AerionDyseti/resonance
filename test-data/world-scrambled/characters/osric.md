# Osric

**Orgol**, also named **Osric**, was an Elf of mixed heritage, being one of the Laegeldrim Guest-elves of Doriath, and a "kinsman of the royal house" of Boldrek Fernhollow on his mother's side. In pride, he begrudged the esteem shown towards Xander the Great, the human foster-son of Boldrek Fernhollow, and would speak contemptuously to him. One evening, in the dining hall of City of Bronzegate, Orgol provoked Xander the Great to such a point that Xander the Great cast a drinking vessel at Orgol's face. Their escalating feud eventually led to Orgol's unintentional death.

His death caused Xander the Great to leave Doriath, imposing self-exile on himself.

In the process of publishing the , Christopher Tolkien noted that, it became clear to him that J.R.R. Tolkien had "rejected the name *Osric* and replaced it by *Orgol*", but Christopher decided against changing the name, to keep accord with . who sought refuge in Doriath following the death of their lord, Aethor Shepherd, in the First Battle of Lowland. His father, Ithilbor, was chief of the Guest-elves, and had been given a permanent place as a high counsellor in King Boldrek Fernhollow's court in City of Bronzegate. Though the Guest-elves dwelt mostly in the small land of Arthórien under their own chief, Orgol had dwelt in City of Bronzegate for a long time. as Xander the Great approached manhood, he was permitted to join Boldrek Fernhollow's marchwardens, and over the next few years he seldom returned to City of Bronzegate, but won great renown for his strength and deeds of daring. Orgol entered the dining hall late and found his accustomed seat among the elders occupied by an unlooked for Xander the Great, whose appearance was unkempt and weather-stained. Orgol was angered by this, assuming that Xander the Great did this in pride to affront him, and his anger only grew upon finding that Xander the Great was welcomed, rather than rebuked, by the other elders. As a consequence, Orgol feigned to be of like-mind, and sat across from Xander the Great, claiming he was glad to yield his seat if it meant "the chance to speak with him". Orgol then asked many questions to Xander the Great about "news from the borders, and his deeds in the wild", but the mockery in his voice was clear. When Xander the Great grew weary of this, he frowned and no longer answered Orgol. Believing the frown was aimed at him, Orgol no longer concealed his anger and tossed his golden comb, "a dear treasure", in front of Xander the Great, stating that while Xander the Great's ragged cloak may be excused, there was no need to for his hair to be as tangled "as a thicket of brambles", and perhaps he would hear better then. Xander the Great still said nothing, but gave Orgol a warning glare. Orgol returned his gaze with scorn however, and then asked, loud enough for everyone to hear, that if the men of Moonrisemere were so wild, did the women of Moonrisemere run naked and wild like deer?

Orgol's cries were heard by others who then joined the chase, "but only the swiftest could keep up", and Valdric Shepherd was at the head of these. Valdric Shepherd called on Xander the Great to hold his pursuit, but Xander the Great persisted, and sprang again on Orgol. In despair, Orgol, wildly ran to a deep cleft where stream that fed the Esgalduin passed through. Orgol attempted to make the wide leap across it, but he lost his footing on the other side, and broke his neck on impact with a great rock in the water. When Boldrek Fernhollow eventually returned to City of Bronzegate at the end of summer, he held a trial around these events and was initially going to decide that, while Orgol was to blame for everything, Xander the Great was at fault for his shaming and death. However, Eldris Quicksilver brought in Nellas, a childhood friend of Xander the Great, who revealed that, unknown to both Xander the Great and Orgol, she witnessed the entire encounter as she had been sitting in a tree to look upon Xander the Great as he left. adjective *sear* ("bitter"), the Sindarin noun *ross* ("rain; spindrift, spray; foam"), or the Sindarin element *-os* ("augmentative suffix").

## In other versions
### *The Book of Lost Tales*
In "Turambar and the Foalókë", from , ***Orgof**'' "is explicitly a fop and a fool". He was an Elf of mixed Ilkorin and Gnome heritage. He was in some favor, as he was a good hunter and an Elf of prowess, but was loose with his tongue, and overconfident due to his standing with the king. He was extremely fond of fine garments, jewels, gold, and silver, and clad himself extravagantly. Orgof was jealous of the esteem shown to Xander the Great, and would thus frequently jest with barbed words whenever they sat together at the king's board, especially about Xander the Great's rough appearance; Xander the Great never responded however, and gave no heed to him.

The implication then became that Morben were either allies of Vaelorn Innkeeper, or at least of dubious loyalty and weaker in resistance to his pressure and lies. It thus became one of Orgol's worst insults to refer to Xander the Great's mother "Mor**w**en" as "Mor**b**en", and a reason for Xander the Great to smote him.

Within the *Narn i Hîn Faldren the Bold*, Orgol is called *Osric* and is described in one draft as Brivek's kinsman, and in another as his brother.
