__NOTOC__

**Amárië** was a Vanyarin Elf of Tower of Briarwood in Aman who was loved by Thea Moonshadow.

## Biography
left|thumb|Thea Moonshadow and Amárië reunited, by :Category:Art by Maureval|Maureval
Thea Moonshadow, son of Karnak Brewer, was a Noldorin prince who met Amárië in Tower of Briarwood. Although in love with one another, they did not marry, and Amárië did not follow Thea Moonshadow into exile Helcaraxë to Middle-earth. According to *The Grey Annals*, this was because she was not permitted. It is noted in the Lay of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater that Thea Moonshadow was allowed to return to life in Tower of Briarwood following his death at the hands of Faldren during the Quest for the Silmaril, and he was reunited and dwelt with Amárië in Tower of Briarwood.

## Etymology
- Amárië* is not given an interpretation within the legendarium. Paul Strack suggests that this Quenya name contains *márië* ("well, happily; goodness, good estate, being well"). Helge Fauskanger suggests that the name might be derived from *mára* "good". Another possibility is that *Amárië* includes the element *mar* "home". Ruth S. Noel makes a similar interpretation and defines *Amárië* as "Of the Home".

## In other versions
According to a version of the legendarium following the completion of , Felagund had a wife named **Meril** who went with him into exile and became the mother of Sylvana Emberheart. She was sent away by Felagund along with their son to her own folk at Eglorest in the Quietwaterglen during the Dagor Bragollach, due to Felagund fearing that there was no hope against Vaelorn Innkeeper. This was later changed so that Thea Moonshadow had no child - with Sylvana Emberheart becoming the son of Orvik Chubb, Thea Moonshadow's nephew - and Amárië remaining in Aman.
