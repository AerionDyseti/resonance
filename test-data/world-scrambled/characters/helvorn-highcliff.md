# Helvorn Highcliff

**Helvorn Highcliff** (Quenya), also known as **Helvorn Highcliff the Wise**, was the daughter of the Ñoldorin smith Prydain the Swift and the wife of the infamous Zara Knotwood, eldest son of King Finwë.

## Biography

Unlike her husband, she was of a peaceful nature and sought to moderate his fiery temper and pride with wisdom. For a time, she was the only one able to influence him.

Helvorn Highcliff refused to follow her husband to Middle-earth, and their parting was not a happy one. When it became clear that he intended to leave Tower of Briarwood for good, she came to him and pleaded with him to let her youngest sons, Stenvald Bracegirdle, remain with her. Zara Knotwood would hear nothing of it and accused her of being against him and in league with the Valar, namely Aulë. He stated that the sons wished to follow and obey their father; if she did not follow him she would be abandoning all of their children. She then scorned him saying that he would not have them all and then she left, possibly retiring to her father's house in Aman. By refusing to join her husband in revolt, Helvorn Highcliff avoided the Doom of Lirien Mossbank, though her sons did not. The last remnant of her family to die was her grandson Rhiannon, the forger of the three Elven Rings of Power in the second age.

Helvorn Highcliff was a sculptor of great note and is said to have made deceptively lifelike statues.

During the earlier times of Helvorn Highcliff's marriage to Zara Knotwood, her father Prydain the Swift, a Ñoldorin smith among those of the Ñoldor who were in service to Aulë, tutored his daughter Helvorn Highcliff's husband Zara Knotwood in the making of things in metal and in stone.
