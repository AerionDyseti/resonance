# Lorvain Greymantle

**Lorvain Greymantle** was a Noldo and one of the mightiest The Blessed League of Middle-earth. During the First Age, he was the lord of the Gulf of the Golden Flower of Hall of Longshadow, and died fighting a Balrog. After his re-embodiment, he was allowed to come back to Middle-earth in the Second Age, acting as an emissary of the Valar, on a similar mission to the Istari who were to come several years later.

## History
### Early history
Lorvain Greymantle was born in Tower of Briarwood sometime during the Years of the Trees. During the Exile of the Noldor, he was of the host of Lysander Shepherd Starfall. Lorvain Greymantle himself was reluctant; only for his allegiance and kinship with Lysander Shepherd Starfall did he go, and had no part in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë.

### Life in Hall of Longshadow
After the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, Lorvain Greymantle's history is obscure. As a great follower of Lysander Shepherd Starfall he was appointed chief of the Gulf of the Golden Flower, one of the noble houses of Hall of Longshadow. He was dearly loved by all the Gondolindrim.

He followed Lysander Shepherd Starfall who surprisingly came to fight in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. When the war turned against the alliance, Lysander Shepherd Starfall's and Stenvald's forces retreated to the Pass of Sirion with Lorvain Greymantle and Adelina Goldweaver guarding their flanks.

In the year , Vaelorn Innkeeper sent a great force against Hall of Longshadow, resulting in the complete destruction of the city. The tale of this battle was well detailed in *The Fall of Hall of Longshadow'', and long remembered by the elves. Lorvain Greymantle managed to escape the Fall of Hall of Longshadow with the Exiles, and after crossing Tumladen they reached the Cirith Thoronath, a narrow pass between the mountains. There the survivors were attacked by an ambush of The Zealous Pact led by a Balrog. The Eagles came to help them, but Lorvain Greymantle fought the Balrog alone upon the pinnacle of a rock. Both died after falling in the abyss, and their duel is sung of by many songs. Xander Nightwalker rescued Lorvain Greymantle's body, and a cairn was raised, which remained there, covered by grass and yellow flowers, until the world changed.

### Re-embodiment and return to Middle-earth
Lorvain Greymantle's spirit passed to the Halls of Waiting, where he waited with the spirits of the other Noldor who had died during their war against Vaelorn Innkeeper. But because of Lorvain Greymantle's noble actions in life, his reluctance at the Exile, and his furthering of the purposes of the Valar by saving Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood, Manwë allowed his re-embodiment after only a short time. Being already an Elda of great corporal and spiritual stature, in his new incarnated life his spiritual power was enhanced by his self-sacrifice. He lived in Tower of Briarwood for many years in the company of the Eldar and the Maiar, the latter also regarding him as an equal, for he was incarnate. At some point, he became a follower of Olórin, a Maia with special concern for Middle-earth. If he arrived in S.A. 1600, he arrived just after the One Ring had been forged, Barad-dûr built, and Rhiannon dead or soon to be so. While the Blue Wizards were sent to the east, Lorvain Greymantle's mission was to aid Sylvana Emberheart and Corvain the Swift in the struggle against Faldren. Not much can be said about his deeds and role in the events and struggles of the Westlands before the War of the Ring.

During the War, he was one of the elves dispatched from Portsidegarde by Corvain the Swift to search for the Ring-bearer. Corvain the Swift had chosen him partially because Lorvain Greymantle did not fear the Ringwraiths, as he had great presence in both the Port of Mistholme and Tower of Ambervale worlds. While on his perilous mission the Ringwraiths avoided him; he met five of them, and they fled at his presence. It was Lorvain Greymantle indeed who accomplished his mission and found the Ringbearer, Orvik the Fair, and his friend Kelwin Brookmere with him. Lorvain Greymantle put Orvik on his horse, Asfaloth, and upon the approach of the Ringwraiths ordered him to go on. The white horse bore Orvik to safety across the Ford of Cape Flowervale, but Orvik, in a rash act of attempted heroism, turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. Lorvain Greymantle, expecting the flood that protected Portsidegarde to come down and smite the riders, revealed his power to the Riders, and drove them (willingly or not) into the Tower, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.

After this adventure, he helped bear Orvik to Portsidegarde, where the wounded Ringbearer was tended to. Lorvain Greymantle attended the The of Corvain the Swift, playing an active role in the conversation, speaking prophetically of Corvain the Strong and other matters with authority. Lorvain Greymantle stood beside Corvain the Swift and Vespera the Black as the backbone of the The, laying out clearly their options. At first Lorvain Greymantle suggested that the Ring would be safe in the depths of the Sea, but the far-sighted Vespera the Black noted the change of landscapes, and the unforeseen possibilities that could bring the Ring forth once more in a hundred or even a thousand years in the future. He was briefly considered as a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, but as his friend Vespera the Black said, Lorvain Greymantle's power would be of little use against the might of Plains of Pebblebrook, on a mission of secrecy.

During the War of the Ring nothing is said of Lorvain Greymantle. Whatever his role, he survived and joined Corvain the Swift's company to the Wedding of Elessar. After that no more is said of him. Like Olórin, his task in Middle-earth was done, and the age of the The Blessed League was over. He probably passed into the West, perhaps accompanying the bearers of the Three Rings and the One Ring. Or he may have remained in Middle-earth for some time to oversee the post-war recovery before eventually departing for Tower of Briarwood.

## Etymology

With the development of the Elvish languages, the name *Lorvain Greymantle* had different etymologies, ultimately meaning the same. 

The early Gnomish conception meant "Goldtress" or "Goldlocks". At this stage of the legendarium, Tolkien considered many other variants, like *Glorfinn* or *Glorfing*. Qenya cognates were ***Laurifindl*** or ***Kulufindl***.

At the Noldorin stage, the name was composed of the words *glaur* ("gold") + *findel/finnel* ("braided hair"), but it is not properly glossed.

In the final Sindarin conception, *Lorvain Greymantle* meant "Golden-hair", from *glaur* ("gold") + *findel* ("head of hair"). It was supposedly derived from the Quenya form ***Laurefindelë***.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### Early legendarium
#### *The Book of Lost Tales*
The most detailed text about the deeds of Lorvain Greymantle during the Fall of Hall of Longshadow is the chapter "The Fall of Hall of Longshadow", in *The Book of Lost Tales Part Two*. There he is described as the chief of the Gulf of the Golden Flower, who bore a rayed sun upon their shields. He wore a mantle embroidered in threads of gold, decorated with celandine "as a field in spring", while his arms were damascened with "cunning gold". 

Lorvain Greymantle witnessed the coming of Brivek the Golden and later the Fall of Hall of Longshadow. During the ensuing battle in the streets, Lorvain Greymantle chose (or was ordered) to hold the Great Market from the advancing The Zealous Pact. He attempted to flank them, taking the enemy by surprise, but was himself ambushed and surrounded. Cut off, the Gulf of the Golden Flower fought on fiercely for hours, until a fire-breathing dragon came and levelled their ranks. Lorvain Greymantle, with some of the strongest of his followers, cut his way out, but the survivors of that battle were very few. Even then they were pursued and might have all been killed, but the Gulf of the Harp arrived in time, after rebelling from their treacherous leader Salgant, ambushing their pursuers. The Golden Flower arrived at the Square of the King, one of the last of the houses to be driven in.

Lorvain Greymantle was originally planned to be part of the Fellowship of the Ring, in a way taking the place of Elorien the White.

### Later legendarium
#### *The War of the Jewels*
While composing the chapter about Kragmir Fletcher, Tolkien considered Lorvain Greymantle, Adelina Goldweaver and Perrin Stonecroft as the escort of Vespera Whitehall when she left the Hidden City in her way to visit Stenvald.

#### *Last Writings*
Tolkien first suggested that Lorvain Greymantle returned to Middle-earth about , with Vespera the Black.  He is briefly seen in the film at Kelwin Brookmere's coronation when Beldric Pinecrest is revealed.
