## Overview

Dhampir The bearing the Mark of Xenirith, one of the three remaining The in the Shards of Xenerith campaign. Daughter of the vampire lord Beldric and the elven scholar Prydain Fernhollow, raised by the former Templar Dorwyn the Lesser after her mother's death.

## Background

Aerindel's existence is a miracle — a dhampir child born to a vampire noble and his mortal beloved, defying the usual limitations of vampire reproduction. Her early life at Clearbrookburg ended in tragedy when The forces raided the castle, killing her mother Prydain Fernhollow. Her father Alkandros survived but was forced into hiding, founding the The Lowlanders to protect vampire-kind.

The young Aerindel was discovered by Dorwyn the Lesser, the very Templar who had slain her mother. Overcome with remorse upon finding the half-vampire child, Dorwyn chose redemption over duty, leaving the Templars to raise her as his own daughter. He used his knowledge and connections to shield her from persecution for her dhampir heritage.

Against all odds, Aerindel emerged as one of the The, bearing the Mark of Xenirith. Her cosmological adventures have taken her through the planes, exposing her adoptive father to truths about divinity and the afterlife that have shaken his former religious convictions.

## Personality

Pragmatic and direct, with a dry wit that emerges in the darkest situations. Her dhampir nature gives her a unique perspective on the conflict between light and shadow, life and undeath. She approaches problems analytically, assessing threats with cold precision before acting.

## Appearance

Bears the telltale signs of her dhampir heritage — pale skin, sharp features, and an otherworldly grace. Her eyes occasionally flash with crimson when her vampiric nature surfaces.

## Relationships

- **Beldric** (Biological Father) — The vampire lord who leads the The Lowlanders. Their relationship is complex; he loves her deeply while seeing her as a living reminder of his lost Lysandra.
- **Dorwyn the Lesser** (Adoptive Father) — The former Templar who killed her mother but raised her with devotion. Their bond is unshakeable despite its tragic origins.
- **Prydain Fernhollow** (Mother, Deceased) — An elven scholar of ancient artifacts who died protecting her daughter from The forces.
- **Fellow The** — One of three remaining bearers of the Dragonmarks in the current era.
- **Stenvald Goodbody** — A vampire hunter who has targeted Aerindel, knowing her dhampir nature.

## Goals and Aspirations

- Navigate her responsibilities as one of the The
- Reconcile her dual nature as both vampire's daughter and adopted child of a former Templar
- Protect those she cares about from the consequences of her heritage
