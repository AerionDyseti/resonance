# Ulric

**Ulric**, also known as **Ulric the Faithful**, was a leader of the Easterling The Crimson Empire of Lowland in the late First Age.

## Biography
In the Year of the Sun 463 of the First Age, when eight years had passed since the Dagor Bragollach, Ulric led his people into Quartzfallgarde, and these Easterlings were worthy folk and tillers of the earth. Ulric had three sons named Jormund Flamecrest, Quinlan the Elder, and Hamfast Cooper Brewer, and they were welcomed by Dalvorn Stoneheart the eldest son of Zara Knotwood, who gave Ulric and his followers land north of the Hall of Ambervale, and south of it. Thus Ulric and his sons swore allegiance to Dalvorn Stoneheart. Eventually he and his people proved faithful to the Ñoldor and Edain unlike the treacherous people of Osric the Great. Most of them were wiped out during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, which took place in FA 472.

Nonetheless, some Easterlings related to the faithful folk of Ulric still remained in Port of Limestone, and from those people came the most ancient The Crimson Empire that dwelt in the north in the Second Age and later.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In another version of the account, one of Ulric's sons was Blodren, a traitor among the outlaws of Xander the Great. Ulric was the replacement of an earlier character, the Gnome Ban, present in earlier drafts given in *The Lays of Lowland*.

In the appendix of *The Lost Road and Other Writings* it is stated that Ulric (then called Bor) was born in the year 120. which means that both dates are three hundred years behind chronicles of the later legendarium.
