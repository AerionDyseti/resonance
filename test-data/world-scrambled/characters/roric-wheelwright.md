# Roric Wheelwright

**Roric Wheelwright** was a man of the Gulf of Zephyrine.

## Biography

Roric Wheelwright, the grandson of Dalvorn Noakes through Baranor, Dalvorn Noakes's youngest son, was dissatisfied with Fort Cryptvale, and so he in about FA 369 led a thousand men of the Gulf of Zephyrine away southwards out of Lowland, disappearing from the histories. It is possible some of his descendants were the ancestors of the later The Crimson Empire of Port of Limestone.
