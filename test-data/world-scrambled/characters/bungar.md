# Bungar

**Bungar** was a faithful friend of Galindor - one of three mariners that accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of Middle-earth.

## Biography

Bungar's kindred and birthdate are unspecified, but it is assumed that he lived in Ashpeakmere, in the Havens of Sirion.

When Galindor resolved to sail to Aman to plead for the Valar's help, Bungar went with him, as did Willa and Zarek the Red. When they reached the shores of the Blessed Realm, he and the others remained aboard while Galindor sought the Valar. After Galindor's embassy was complete, Eönwë, herald of Manwë, came to Bungar and the others and set them upon another ship. Manwë then sent a great wind to blow them east back to Middle-earth.

His fate afterwards is unknown.

## Etymology

***Bungar*** is a Sindarin word for 'Sea Wanderer'. His name should be pronounced as *eye-ran-deer.*
