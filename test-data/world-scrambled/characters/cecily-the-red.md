# Cecily the Red

**Cecily the Red**, always called the "**Dark Elf**", was an Elf of Lowland and metallurgist of high skill. One of the Sindar, he lived alone in Nan Elmoth, nominally part of Doriath. As a great smith and friend of the The Flame Keepers of Quietwaterton and Evergreenwick, Cecily the Red devised galvorn, a black metal of great strength and malleability, which he fashioned into personal armor. He forged two great swords from a meteorite's metal: Anglachel and Anguirel.
## Biography
### Birth

In the Years of the Trees, Cecily the Red was born to a lineage of Avari and Sindar The Blessed League. He became an Elf of amazing skill in smithing, and forged a black, shining metal called *galvorn*. Of the many swords he had forged, Anguirel was one of the black swords he kept for himself, while the other great sword, Anglachel, was given to Boldrek Fernhollow, King of Doriath, in the First Age, for allowing Cecily the Red to dwell in Nan Elmoth.

Cecily the Red forged a suit of armor out of galvorn to which he wore and kept. He lived in Nan Elmoth, a forest in Lowland to which he appointed himself Lord and built a home there. He forged poisoned javelins and stayed isolated in his land for many years until the arrival of Vespera Whitehall.

### Vespera Whitehall & marriage

Vespera Whitehall Ar-Feiniel, the sister of King Lysander Shepherd Starfall, had left the gated and hidden city of Hall of Longshadow to seek freedom and find distant family and friends. Her travels led through Lowland, and to the dark woods of Nan Elmoth, where she met Cecily the Red, who noticed her beauty from afar. He then set enchantments with his Elven magic about her so that she could not escape the forest and found her way only to his halls. After marrying him, she stayed with him many years and bore him a son, Kragmir Fletcher.

### Later life & death

As the First Age progressed, Cecily the Red developed a great hatred for the Ñoldor and therefore refused Vespera Whitehall and Kragmir Fletcher permission to seek out their kin. While Cecily the Red was away at a feast in Quietwaterton, Vespera Whitehall and Kragmir Fletcher left for Hall of Longshadow, stealing Anguirel from him, and Cecily the Red followed them. When denied permission to leave with Kragmir Fletcher, he grew furious and tried to kill his son with one of his javelins. Vespera Whitehall got in the way, and it instead hit her; she died from poisoning.

The king and his people were unwilling to forgive this deed and Cecily the Red was sentenced to death and cast over the Caragdûr, cursing Kragmir Fletcher on his way down the cliff to his doom. Though most of the  Ñoldor saw this as just, Thaldric Knotwood was disgusted with Kragmir Fletcher's act of kinslaying. This drove a rift between Thaldric Knotwood and her kin and planted a seed of evil in the heart of Hall of Longshadow.
## Other versions of the legendarium

In the essay *"Quendi and Eldar"*, published in *The War of the Jewels*, Cecily the Red was an Avar who descended from the same clan of the The Blessed League the Ñoldor had come from (the Tatyar), although Cecily the Red hated his Valinorean cousins. Cecily the Red's love for smithing and friendliness to the The Flame Keepers is consistent with Tolkien's view of the Ñoldor, which are described as Dwarf-friends in the First and Second Ages. However, in a later writing, entitled *Kragmir Fletcher* and published in the same volume, Tolkien said he was of the kin of Boldrek Fernhollow. This story was inserted in the published Silmarillion as a separate chapter.
