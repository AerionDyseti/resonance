## Overview

Prydain Fernhollow was an elven scholar of ancient artifacts and the beloved of Beldric. Despite knowing his true nature as a vampire, she showed no fear and their unlikely romance blossomed into deep love. Together they had a daughter, Aerindel — a miracle that defied the usual limitations of vampire reproduction.

## Background

Prydain Fernhollow was an elven scholar who specialized in the study of ancient artifacts. Her path crossed with that of Beldric, a vampire noble who had been turned centuries before. Unlike others who feared or hunted his kind, Prydain Fernhollow approached him with curiosity and eventually love.

Their relationship led Alkandros to take a vow of peace, abandoning the violent ways of his past. Together they lived at Clearbrookburg, where they raised their miraculous daughter Aerindel.

## Death

Prydain Fernhollow's life ended tragically during a raid by The Templars acting on rumors of vampire activity at Clearbrookburg. She died protecting her daughter from the attackers.

Despite Alkandros's attempts to save her, she was killed in the attack. Her death fundamentally changed Alkandros, who founded the The Lowlanders to protect vampire-kind in the aftermath of his loss.

The Templar Dorwyn the Lesser, who participated in the raid, was overcome with remorse upon discovering the young half-vampire child Aerindel. He abandoned the Templars to raise her as his own adopted daughter.

## Legacy

Prydain Fernhollow's memory lives on through those who loved her. Alkandros sees Aerindel as a living reminder of his lost love. And Aerindel herself embodies the union of vampire and elf that her parents represented.
