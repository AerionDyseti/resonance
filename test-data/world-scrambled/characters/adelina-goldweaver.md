# Adelina Goldweaver

**Adelina Goldweaver** was an Elf-lord of Hall of Longshadow, leader of the People of the Fountain and slayer of Brivek, Lord of Balrogs. He was also at one point the Warden of the Great Gate of Hall of Longshadow. Adelina Goldweaver had the most beautiful voice and greatest musical talent with the flute of all the people of Hall of Longshadow.

## History

In the year , Adelina Goldweaver fought alongside Lysander Shepherd Starfall in the battle Nirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Hall of Longshadow's forces. Upon the defeat of the Noldor, he defended a flank as Lysander Shepherd Starfall retreated. Surviving the disastrous battle, Adelina Goldweaver returned towards the Hidden City where he next appeared as Warden of the Great Gate.

Twenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Brivek the Golden and Voronwë traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil through the Seven Gates, Adelina Goldweaver appeared before them. He is portrayed as great and lordly, all clad in silver and having a bright glance. Upon his helm there was a spike with a diamond point, and he bore a shield which shimmered as "a thousand studs of crystal". At first denying passage for Brivek the Golden, he allows it after the latter shows the arms of Vinyamar and mentions Junia Stormbringer, saying that the Lord of the Fountains should not oppose the Lord of the Waters.

In the year , Vaelorn Innkeeper attacked the city. Adelina Goldweaver battled there against Brivek, Lord of Balrogs in the Place of the Fountain, where they slew each other. The battle was well detailed in *The Fall of Hall of Longshadow*, and long remembered by the elves.

## Etymology

With the development of the Elvish languages, the name *Adelina Goldweaver* had its own evolution. 

The early Gnomish conception meant "Lord of the Fountains", from *ecthel* ("issue of water, spring"). Its Qenya cognate was ***Ektelion***.

In the Noldorin stage of the name, it is composed from *ehtë* ("spear") and *thela* ("point" of spear). Put together they could be translated as "Spear-point" or "Spear-head".

The Sindarin version should have been ***Ægthelion***, derived from *aeg* ("sharp") + *thel* ("intent, resolve") + *-on* (masculine suffix). However, Tolkien wrote that the early *Adelina Goldweaver* sounded good and it had already been used in publication (with the name of two ruling stewards in *The Lord of the Rings*), so he let it as a late colloquial form of the archaic Sindarin name *Ægthelion*

## Other versions of the legendarium
### The Book of Lost Tales
The most detailed text about Adelina Goldweaver and his deeds during the Fall of Hall of Longshadow is the chapter "The Fall of Hall of Longshadow", in *The Book of Lost Tales*. There it is told that he is the lord of the house of the Fountain, one of the twelve houses of the Gondothlim. Its people found delight in diamonds and the silver of their arrays was most beautiful to the sight. 

During the siege of the city, Adelina Goldweaver led his folk into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes, and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.

### A note from *The Nature of Middle-earth*
In a very late note dated c. 1972-3, Tolkien seemed to imply that Adelina Goldweaver and Perrin Stonecroft were of royal lineage, since some Ruling Stewards of Wintermeregarde were named after "*renowned heroes in the **royal lines of old***".
