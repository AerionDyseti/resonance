# Jormund the Great (of Cobbin Leafwalker's kin)

**Jormund the Great** was Ñoldor Elf of the First Age.

## Biography

Jormund the Great was originally of Cobbin Leafwalker's people that ruled Hall of Evergreen before the Dagor Bragollach. When Hall of Evergreen was overrun during that battle, he fled south with a number of survivors to the safe havens of Gwendolyn Riverstone. Sometime between FA 490 and FA 495, he and his companion Arminas traveled to Obsidianvale warning Lord Orvik Chubb of the impending threat to the realm. He and Arminas's counsels were dismissed by Xander the Great, the High Captain of Obsidianvale whom Orvik Chubb ultimately deferred to in matters of war. Jormund the Great and Arminas eventually departed south and reported what they were told to Gwendolyn Riverstone.

His fate is unknown.
