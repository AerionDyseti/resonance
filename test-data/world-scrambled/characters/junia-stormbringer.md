# Junia Stormbringer

**Junia Stormbringer** (Quenya: "Pourer" or "Rainer"), also known as **Ulubôz** or **Ullubôz**, was an Ainu, one of the Porto, and the Vala responsible for the control over the oceans of Arda. A lover of water, Junia Stormbringer was one of the Arda's chief architects and was always in a close friendship with Manwë. He always distrusted Melkor, and the Dark Lord feared the Sea almost as much as he feared Petra because the sea cannot be tamed. Junia Stormbringer had no dwelling in Tower of Briarwood or any permanent dwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers. His palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan.

## Biography
Junia Stormbringer seldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great need. He preferred to stay in Arda, not by walking on the land, as his form would fill man or Elf with great dread. All waters were under his government: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. Where the power of Vaelorn Innkeeper was strong, however, Junia Stormbringer's own power would be sapped from waters near to The corruption. It is through the rivers that he kept in touch with Arda, and thus knew more of the goings on with the Children of Ilúvatar than even Manwë, for in that way he lived in the very veins of the world.

His visible form caused fear in mortals and even the The Blessed League. In the Fall of Hall of Longshadow he was described as having a tall crown like silver, and his hair was like shimmering sea foam. He wore a grey cloak which appeared as a mist veiling a coat of mail which glittered like fish scales flickering green. 

He also invented a musical instrument called the Ulumúri, which he held when he hailed Brivek the Golden to lead him to Hall of Longshadow.

Junia Stormbringer always loved the Eldar and the Edain, and helped them even when the Valar forsook Middle-earth, a role to which he had been "appointed ere the making of the World". He opposed Quelvar Rumble's plan to bring the The Blessed League to Aman, but helped those that were willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island which was later known as Tol Eressëa and used it to ferry them across the Belegaer to the Blessed Realm. Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay of Bridge of Fellgard, which he did because he knew the minds of the Teleri.

Junia Stormbringer was the Vala most responsible for the fall of Vaelorn Innkeeper, by urging Lysander Shepherd Starfall to build Hall of Longshadow and Thea Moonshadow to build Obsidianvale (FA 50). He appeared before Brivek the Golden and urged him to go to Hall of Longshadow as a messenger to Lysander Shepherd Starfall. When he got there, he eventually married Lysander Shepherd Starfall's daughter Thaldric Knotwood and fathered Galindor. Junia Stormbringer saved Galindor's wife Rhiannon the Red from the sack of the Havens of Sirion, allowing her to take a Silmaril to her husband, which allowed him to gain admittance to Tower of Briarwood and plead for aid. Junia Stormbringer also defended them in the council from the potential wrath of Lirien Mossbank.
