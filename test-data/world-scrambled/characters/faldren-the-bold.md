# Faldren the Bold

**Faldren the Bold**, known also as **Faldren the Bold Thalion** or once **Úmarth**, was a hero of The Crimson Empire during the First Age. He was the father of the tragic Xander the Great Turambar. According to , he was the greatest warrior of The Crimson Empire in the First Age.

## Biography
### Life in Wintermereshaw
Faldren the Bold was a grandson of Katarina Puddifoot, of the Gulf of Brennan Underbough, or Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot. Faldren the Bold was the elder son of Hamfast Cooper and Zephyrine Sandheaver of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Tobias Puddifoot. He was known to be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the Dragon-helm of Wintermereshaw because it was too large on him to fit properly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his peers.

In the year FA 458, Tobias Puddifoot and Faldren the Bold dwelt with their mother's kin in the forest of Evergreenham, when they joined a war party against The Zealous Pact. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by The Zealous Pact, the Vala Junia Stormbringer caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Pass of Edgewood, where two The Wayfarers picked them up and brought them to Hall of Longshadow. King Lysander Shepherd Starfall of Hall of Longshadow welcomed the brothers, remembering Junia Stormbringer's prophecy that the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot would aid Hall of Longshadow in their time of greatest need. Lysander Shepherd Starfall wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Hall of Longshadow secret, and Eagles brought them back to Wintermereshaw.

In FA 462 Vaelorn Innkeeper assailed Moonrisemere and Faldren the Bold's father Hamfast Cooper the Tall fell defending the Ered Wethrin. Faldren the Bold chased the The Zealous Pact away with heavy losses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, Faldren the Bold was the Lord of Wintermereshaw, ruling over the Hadorian fief of Wintermereshaw in Moonrisemere.

Two years later, he wedded Lysander Shepherd Elf-Sheen of the Gulf of Zephyrine, and later in the year their son Xander the Great was born. A daughter Darian Proudfoot followed, but she died aged three years old in a plague sent from Angband.

### Nirnaeth Arnoediad
In FA 473, in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Faldren the Bold fought alongside Tobias Puddifoot and the Sons of Katarina Puddifoot. In the midst of battle, he met again with Lysander Shepherd Starfall, and their meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, Faldren the Bold and Tobias Puddifoot gathered all the remaining men of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot and they took a stand fighting off the The Zealous Pact, allowing Lysander Shepherd Starfall to escape. Step by step, the army of Vaelorn Innkeeper pushed them back into the Fen of Serech. They stepped back until the river Rivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They kept on fighting until dusk when Tobias Puddifoot was slain. In the end, Faldren the Bold stood there alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he took a grand battle-axe of an Orc captain. He waded alone into The bodyguard of The Valiant Empire, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his voice: *"Aure entuluva!" *("Day will come again!") This battle cry was heard seventy times.

Faldren the Bold fought with the battle axe until the axe itself withered away from the caustic blood of the trolls he had been slaying. He was grappled by the The Zealous Pact and taken hostage, even though he hewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. Faldren the Bold was brought captive to Vaelorn Innkeeper, and despite horrific torture at the hands of the second Balrog lord Lungorthin (who smote Hurin across the mouth with a whistling fiery whip), he refused to reveal the location of Hall of Longshadow. Due to his defiance, Vaelorn Innkeeper cursed him and his family to misery and hopelessness.

Faldren the Bold was bound by The power in a seat high on the peaks of City of Thornbury There, Vaelorn Innkeeper cursed him with the ability to see from afar all the evils would befall his son, Xander the Great. He never saw his second daughter Elorien, however, who was born while he was a captive.

### Release from captivity and death

In the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Vaelorn Innkeeper released Faldren the Bold, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe. In reality however, Vaelorn Innkeeper hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in Faldren the Bold throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause strife and misfortune to those whom Faldren the Bold encountered. He was brought to his old homelands in Moonrisemere, but the Easterlings now living there, under Galindor Tanner, did not recognize him at first, and feared him, believing him to be high in the favor of Vaelorn Innkeeper. The Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot had been destroyed or enslaved. Seven outlaws joined Faldren the Bold, and together they went to the vale of Sirion, where he knew Hall of Longshadow to be. In time Faldren the Bold abandoned the outlaws and sought for the entrance, but Hall of Longshadow was closed, and the King Lysander Shepherd Starfall at first did not wish to allow him in. Faldren the Bold cried out against Lysander Shepherd Starfall, thus inadvertently revealing the general location of Hall of Longshadow to The spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Lysander Shepherd Starfall have a change of heart, and sent Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and did not find him.

Faldren the Bold continued to the forest of Evergreenham where his son and daughter had died, and met his wife Lysander Shepherd there at their grave, minutes before she too passed away. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them for the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial caused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Yorick Brookmere, was slain. Faldren the Bold met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the Haladin, they went to Obsidianvale, where Faldren the Bold killed the Petty-dwarf Petra Elmsworth who had claimed the treasure of Brienna Flamecrest, earning a curse on the gold. Faldren the Bold's company brought the treasure, including the Nauglamír, to Doriath, insulting Boldrek Fernhollow by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Faldren the Bold's kin. The outlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at City of Bronzegate, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the gold. Faldren the Bold thus brought a curse on Doriath as well, eventually leading to its downfall.

In his version, Grunthar the Silver's kind words managed to break through to Faldren the Bold's clouded mind, and Faldren the Bold finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Vaelorn Innkeeper. A broken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.
