AI summary: An Alhoon, an undead Illithid, serves as a scholar and Conductor of the Phalanx of Oaths in the Reliquary of Names. It possesses unique multitasking abilities and is bound by a magical contract to Queen Nilorin, driven by pragmatic self-interest and a desire to research a temporal anomaly. The Alhoon can be bribed or persuaded to act against Nilorin's interests, showing contempt for elf shadows and displaying frantic behavior in its research.

## Role/Occupation

Isolde and researcher in the Reliquary of Names; undead Illithid (Alhoon); Conductor of the Phalanx of Oaths

## Description

Seven feet tall with pale blue rubbery skin, its elongated face bears no mouth—only half a dozen tendrils. The creature has the sagging skin and too-sharp fingertips of undeath. It reads multiple books simultaneously with its mouth-tentacles while writing in others with its hands, displaying inhuman multitasking capability.

## Background

Alhoons are Illithid who have transcended death, their corpses puppeted by pure psionic power. These creatures were myths even when elves were young—boogeymen from the Age of Legends, the stuff of bedtime stories meant to frighten children.

This particular Alhoon serves as the Conductor of the Phalanx of Oaths in the Reliquary of Names, but **it does not serve Nilorin out of loyalty**—it is bound by a magical contract, not a blood oath. It functions as an archivist of Nilorin's "New The," overseeing the thousands of soul-pacts that bind the undead to her service.

The Alhoon is desperately researching something related to the disruption of time. When the ley lines shifted millennia ago, this entire realm was temporally suspended, and something about that stasis troubles the ancient scholar.

## Goals/Motivations

- Research the temporal anomaly related to the castle's frozen state
- **Pragmatic self-interest**—it wants a better deal and could potentially be bribed or convinced that Nilorin's plan will ultimately fail
- Protect its research above all else

## Relationships

- **Queen Nilorin** — Contractor, not follower; bound by magical contract rather than faith or loyalty
- **Elf The Jade The** — Treats them with open contempt; considers them beneath notice

## Potential Social Solutions

The Alhoon is a **pragmatist**. It can potentially be:

- **Bribed** with a sufficiently powerful magic item or promise of rare, extra-planar knowledge
- **Persuaded** (DC 28) that Nilorin's plan will ultimately fail and destroy its research
- If successful, it will "accidentally" destroy the master-oath scroll itself, stop the ritual, and plane shift away

## Observed Behavior

- Frantically cross-referencing multiple books simultaneously
- Searching for something specific related to temporal disruption
- Commands elf shadow servants but treats them as beneath notice
- Speaks in a guttural tongue
- Snarled and blasted an elf shadow back against the wall for bringing an unwanted scroll

## Notes

- The party observed the Alhoon while invisible but chose to steal scrolls rather than parlay
- One elf shadow saw the invisible party but chose not to alert the Alhoon—apparently sharing the contempt
- "From everything the bedtime stories say about these creatures, it's unlikely to be a fervent follower of the Queen. There may be room to talk." — Hall assessment
- The Reliquary contains the Castle Attunement Ledger—signing it grants access to the Moon-Veil teleportation network but binds the signer to Nilorin's will
- Potential future parlay target
