# Fiora the Wise (Edain)

**Fiora the Wise** was an Edain of the Gulf of Zephyrine and one of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth's faithful XII Bëorings.

## Biography

After the Dagor Bragollach, Fiora the Wise remained with Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth and his company who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Vaelorn Innkeeper, thus they became outlaws surviving for nearly five years in the barren highlands above the forest of Hall of Evergreen, then in the hands of Vaelorn Innkeeper. He and the others were eventually betrayed to Faldren by the unhappy Norvald Stormwind and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
