# Corwin Greendale

**Corwin Greendale** (Sindarin; IPA: ) was a Maia spirit known as ***The Lady of the Sea*** and the wife of the Maia Ossë. She was a matron to all mariners. Corwin Greendale was third greatest of all the Maiar.

## Biography
### Before the Sun and the Moon
Corwin Greendale loved all creatures that lived in the saltwater streams of the world and the weeds that grew in them. Her love calmed the violent tidal waves and storms created by Ossë her husband by keeping him in line and not going too far. Her hair spread throughout waters and lies on their surfaces. During the early days Arda, Ossë rebelled against his Lord Junia Stormbringer (*Lord of All Waters*) and served Melkor instead, being carried away by the false promises that Melkor gave to him. For a while, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to the lands. Because of this, and because of the prayers of Aulë who created those lands, Corwin Greendale helped bring Ossë back to the allegiance of their lord Junia Stormbringer by restraining her husband and bringing him before Junia Stormbringer. Following that, Ossë was pardoned and gave his allegiance back to the Valar. To the Maiar Corwin Greendale and Ossë, Junia Stormbringer gave them the task of the governing of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Ever afterwards, Corwin Greendale was the one who restrained Zaldric's bouts of violence in the seas and on the coasts.

Eventually, when the Teleri remained on the coast of the western seas, awaiting Junia Stormbringer to take them to Aman, Corwin Greendale and Ossë came among the Teleri and befriended them. After the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, where Zara Knotwood and his host of exiled Ñoldor attacked the Teleri and stole their ships, Corwin Greendale wept for the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the sea. The sea also rose in great wrath against the Ñoldorin slayers, so that many of the stolen Telerin ships were wrecked and the Ñoldor in them were drowned.

When the Hiding of Tower of Briarwood took place, Ossë raised the enchanted Isles. Then next, Corwin Greendale enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by weaving them in her hair before Irmo (*Master of Dreams & Desires*) put them to age-long sleep.

### Second Age
In the Second Age, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Corwin Greendale for help, because she was the only one capable of calming Ossë who loved to create tumults in the seas. And the Númenóreans lived under her protection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the Númenóreans held the Maia Corwin Greendale in reverence as equal to the Valar.
