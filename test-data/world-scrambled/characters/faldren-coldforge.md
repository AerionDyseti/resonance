## Biography

Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth was the elder son of Boron, the third chieftain of the folk of Zephyrine, and the great-grandson of Zephyrine the Old. He also had a younger brother named Belegor, about whom little is known. Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth became the fourth Chieftain of the Gulf of Zephyrine after the death of his father. When the Elven kings decided to grant lands to the chieftains of the Edain, Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth was granted the land of Haunthollowford in Hall of Evergreen as a fief under the Elven-lords Cobbin Leafwalker and Aerindel the Black, the younger sons of Karnak Brewer (the Ñoldorin king in Aman) and the brothers of King Thea Moonshadow of Obsidianvale. He thus became the first Lord of Haunthollowford. 

Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth was the father of Ponto Shadowend, his first child and only son, Naeris his second child and elder daughter, and Beril his last child and younger daughter.

Two later Lords of Wintermeregarde and warriors of renown were named after Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth son of Boron, including Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth of the Fellowship of the Ring.
