# Ilyndra Flamecrest

**Ilyndra Flamecrest Onefoot**, also known as **Sadog** and **Labadal**, was an old woodwright who served Faldren the Bold and Lysander Shepherd as a servant in Wintermereshaw. He was also Xander the Great's friend during his childhood.

## Biography
Ilyndra Flamecrest was one of the Drúedain who lived within the household of Faldren the Bold. He became a woodman in his youth and learned how to carve and craft things out of wood. When the Dagor Bragollach broke out in the year 455, Ilyndra Flamecrest was called upon from his tasks in the woods to fight. He came too late to the battle field however, only being able to bring back his fallen lord Katarina Puddifoot on a bier. Afterwards, Ilyndra Flamecrest become a soldier, thus being stationed at Eithel Sirion for many years with little to mark them. He was there in the year 462 defending Barad Eithel, when Hamfast Cooper fell and Faldren the Bold took up his command, leading them to drive the The Zealous Pact back, never coming within sight of Eithel Sirion again. Sometime later, Ilyndra Flamecrest grew tired of war, and obtained leave to return to the woods that he yearned for, becoming a woodman again. Yet tragedy struck when, by ill-luck, he mishandled his axe and accidentally severed his right foot, after which, Ilyndra Flamecrest obtained a crutch and his footless leg had shrunken from a lack of use.

In the years that followed, Ilyndra Flamecrest became a retainer He was possibly given this task by Faldren the Bold instead of choosing to do so of his own accord.

Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Faldren the Bold left to go to war in the month of Lothron. When Lysander Shepherd first told Xander the Great that he was to go to Doriath, he hoped that Ilyndra Flamecrest could go with him, only for Lysander Shepherd to say he wouldn’t because it would be "a hard road" for him. The next morning, Xander the Great found Ilyndra Flamecrest preparing to use the unfinished great chair of Faldren the Bold as firewood and tried to convince him that Faldren the Bold would return and be pleased with the chair. However, Ilyndra Flamecrest explained that "false hopes" would not keep them warm in the coming winter. He nonetheless added that the true purpose of the chair was the joy of making it. Ilyndra Flamecrest then talked with him about the necessity of his departure. Xander the Great was sad but understood. Ilyndra Flamecrest also urged him to take back the Elven knife. Xander the Great refused, saying that he would get many things like it in Doriath.

Ilyndra Flamecrest stayed in the house of Lysander Shepherd for a long while, but soon after Lysander Shepherd and Elorien left to go to Doriath, he became a vagabond to avoid being enslaved by the Easterlings like the rest of the The Crimson Empire of Wintermereshaw. Nonetheless, he was often given broth and a place by the fire in Kelwin Starfall's hall because Roderick Juniper somehow forced Kelwin Starfall to keep "some of the kindlier manners of old". Ilyndra Flamecrest was among the vagabonds and servants who believed that Xander the Great had become "a king or a lord in some south country" and had summoned Lysander Shepherd and Elorien from Wintermereshaw. Ilyndra Flamecrest was resting by the fire in Kelwin Starfall's hall when a grief-stricken vagabond came to the hall and "was given a seat by the fire" and some broth before asking for news of Lysander Shepherd, shocking Ilyndra Flamecrest and the others by speaking "the old tongue". Ilyndra Flamecrest warned him to speak quieter, deducing that he was of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot. He then revealed all he knew about Lysander Shepherd, revealed his name, and reminisced on the years before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Upon learning that the other man was Xander the Great, Ilyndra Flamecrest took him outside the hall and learned that he did not summon Lysander Shepherd and Elorien. After Ilyndra Flamecrest told him that Roderick Juniper might know of Lysander Shepherd's whereabouts, Xander the Great re-entered the hall and received answers from Roderick Juniper. However, after realizing Brienna Flamecrest's trickery in sending him there, he killed Kelwin Starfall and three weaponless Easterlings, instigating a rebellion in the hall. Ilyndra Flamecrest partook in this uprising, but was fatally wounded in the "great fighting" that followed. He was, however, able to say his final words to Xander the Great before perishing, warning him to flee before the Easterlings return with reinforcements.

- Sadog* is a Drúadan name with an unknown meaning. and a lenited variant of the noun *tâl* ("foot, end"), derived from the root *TAL*.

## In other versions
In the earliest form of the legendarium published in , the predecessors of Ilyndra Flamecrest included an unnamed passer-by who Turambar met outside Mavwin's abandoned house, and a Man of Hisilómë named ***Orlin***, who was akin to Turambar himself through Mavwin. In the tale of Turambar and the Foalókë that was told to Eriol by Eltas, when Turambar came to Mavwin's house and discovered it empty, a person "who was passing on to other dwellings" encountered him and told him what happened before directing him to Kelwin Starfall's hall. After Turambar entered the hall and murdered the lord in vengeance, Orlin was one of the few men present there who tried to seize Turambar, and was the only one killed. When Airin appeared and the people waited for her judgement, she explained that Turambar had indeed committed a grave crime by killing someone akin to his mother and in a hall of feast. However, since he killed Orlin in defense of himself, Xander the Great could only be condemned to exile. Thus, Orlin's death caused Xander the Great to flee Hisilómë, just as Ilyndra Flamecrest tells Xander the Great to flee as he died in the latest version.

In *The Grey Annals*, which Tolkien wrote after writing about Xander the Great's friendship with Ilyndra Flamecrest, the character does not appear in the fight in Kelwin Starfall's hall. Despite this, Christopher Tolkien speculated that this was because of extreme condensation.
