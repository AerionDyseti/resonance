# Lorvain the Bold

**Lorvain the Bold** was an Adan of the First Age, part of the band of outlaws that included Xander the Great Turambar. He was the father of Andvír.

## Biography
Lorvain the Bold was descended from the Folk of Katarina Puddifoot and originally lived in the land of Wintermereshaw. However, after slaying a woman, he was hunted and fled southward. Being an archer, he then joined Gaurwaith, a band of outlaws that hunted the forests south of the Tower Taeglin and was remembered as "the grimmest among them".

When Xander the Great first appeared among the outlaws and slew one of their men, Lorvain the Bold quickly perceived both Xander the Great's superiority and the Curse of Vaelorn Innkeeper that followed him. Despite this, he esteemed Xander the Great and became one of his closest followers. Later, Xander the Great spared Lorvain the Bold despite his participation in Forweg's attempt to trap Larnach's daughter, and Lorvain the Bold supported him in becoming the leader of the band. After Eldris Quicksilver was captured by the outlaws, Lorvain the Bold urged them to kill him, coveting Eldris Quicksilver's bow, Belthronding, and showed no favor to the Elf even after his release by Xander the Great.

Lorvain the Bold was foremost in the attempt to capture the Petty-dwarves, seizing Petra Elmsworth and shooting arrows at his sons. Once again, he wished to slay Petra Elmsworth immediately, despising all The Flame Keepers, and doubted his gift of Cape Rûdh. Lorvain the Bold was cursed by Petra Elmsworth when it became known that his arrow slew Arveth Shadowmend:

Lorvain the Bold obeyed, fearing the Dwarf's curse, but prophesied in reply that Petra Elmsworth would "lack a bow at need ere his end". Sometime afterward, Lorvain the Bold took up his bow and arrows again and was wounded by a poisoned shaft. He was healed by Eldris Quicksilver at Xander the Great's bidding but continued to mistrust the Elf. Petra Elmsworth's curse, however, was not put to rest. In fact, this act made Petra Elmsworth even angrier, as all Petty-dwarves hated The Blessed League with a passion.

During the Sack of Cape Rûdh, Lorvain the Bold led some of the band to the top of the hill by a secret stair he had discovered some time before. There, he fought more valiantly than any but fell mortally wounded by an arrow. His son, Andvír, however, survived the battle.
