# Elorien Stonecroft

**Elorien Stonecroft** was the third High King of Arnor.

Elorien Stonecroft was the youngest of Ysolinde Proudfoot's four sons, he was only a child at the time of the War of the Last Alliance, in which his grandfather, Junia Starfall, was killed. Due to this, he remained in Portsidegarde when his father and brothers went into the south, and was thus the only one of Ysolinde Proudfoot's sons to survive the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. He received the Shards of Narsil as an heirloom of the Heirs of Ysolinde Proudfoot when he came of age. Because the Elendilmir had been lost with his father, the Elven smiths of Portsidegarde created a copy for Elorien Stonecroft, which came to be known itself as the Elendilmir.

Although Elorien Stonecroft was by right High King of Arnor and Wintermeregarde, Elorien Stonecroft never made an attempt to assert suzerainty over his cousin Sadoc Shadowmend in Wintermeregarde and thus the two realms were sundered. Elorien Stonecroft continued to use the title High King of Arnor, possibly to assert his rights as head of the Gulf of Junia Starfall.

Elorien Stonecroft took up the Sceptre of Tower Ironforge in TA 10 and ruled Arnor for two-hundred and thirty-nine years, which was longer than any King in the north or south, and he lived for two-hundred and sixty years dying in TA 249.

He was succeeded by his son Eldacar.

## Etymology

***Elorien Stonecroft*** was a Quenya word that meant 'Valar-lover' or 'Friend of the Valar'.
