> *"The city is deafening with its silence. Only out here, where the wind scrapes the bone, does the world speak the truth."*

## Basic Information

- **Full Name**: Cobbin Errantus (born simply "Cobbin")
- **Caste**: Cape (Roadwarden)
- **Archetype**: Bay Ranger / Survivalist
- **Affiliation**: The Empire of Isle of Pearlhaven (nominally); The Wilds (true allegiance)
- **Faith**: Pays homage to Gendei (The Wild Watcher) for survival and Ahnas (Sol) for mercy from the heat

## Physical Description

Cobbin is a man carved from the desert itself. His skin is deeply tanned and weathered by the relentless The sun. He possesses a sharp, stoic face framed by unkempt, sun-bleached brown hair and a rough beard that speaks to weeks spent away from civilization.

**Attire**: He wears the practical, layered garb of a deep-desert strider. His signature garment is a heavy, rust-orange hooded cloak and scarf, wrapped loosely to protect against sandstorms and the midday glare. Beneath this, he wears worn but well-oiled leather armor and bracers reinforced with bronze studs. His trousers are loose and light-colored to deflect heat, tucked into sturdy, dust-caked boots.

**Equipment**: He carries a curved, single-edged blade (a falchion or messer) suitable for slashing through beast hide, and a variety of pouches containing herbal salves, water skins, and map-making tools.

## Personality & Beliefs

**The Whispering Land**: Unlike many in the The Eternal The who view the desert as a threat to be walled out, Cobbin views it as a living entity. He claims to hear the "whispers" of the land—shiftings in the dunes that predict storms, or the silence that precedes a predator.

**Caste Friction**: While he serves the The Eternal The, he holds a quiet disdain for the politics of the Judicators and the grandeur of the Bridge. He believes the city makes people "soft and deaf."

**The Name "Errantus"**: Born simply "Cobbin," he earned the moniker "Errantus" (The Wandering) from his superiors due to his tendency to disappear on long, unsanctioned patrols deep into the wastes, often returning with intelligence on threats no one else knew existed.

## Skills & Abilities

- **Sand-Walking**: Moves across shifting dunes without leaving a discernible trail, a technique learned from watching desert predators
- **First World Sensitivity**: His time in the deep desert near the Salt Mines has made him sensitive to the "thin spots" between Goldleafgarde and the First World (So-el). He often suffers migraines when near planar rifts.
- **Combat Style**: Pragmatic and brutal. He does not duel; he ambushes. He uses the environment—kicking sand, using glare, and luring enemies into unstable terrain—to gain the upper hand.

## Campaign History (Sessions 2-10)

### Joining the Party (Session 2)

Cobbin was introduced as a The Eternal The Roadwarden during the falcon case. He helped with diplomatic efforts involving Vaelorn Leafwalker and provided security awareness during the subsequent street pursuit. Thea was assigned adjudicator status to work with him.

### The Bay Expedition (Sessions 4-10)

Cobbin's expertise defined the desert journey:

- Session 4: Led night departures along the ancient Quartzhelm trade road; taught desert survival including night travel, water extraction, and "land whispering"; identified approaching sandstorm with 8-12 hour warning
- His guidance provided tactical bonuses throughout the expedition
- Maintained the party's two-day trailing distance behind Oriana
- Distributed sunrise cinnamon for heat tolerance

### The Mirathel Burrows

Cobbin was deeply disturbed by the Mirathel Burrows's presence. To him, it represented a "silence" in the land—an unnatural void that terrified him more than any beast. This sensitivity to wrongness in the natural order made him particularly effective at identifying the threat.

### Bridge Dungeon Combat

- Session 8: Reactivated silenced resonant pillars using precise archery
- Session 10: Reactivated pillars using frost bolt strikes to restore defensive barriers after the Mirathel Burrows silenced them

### The Cursed Spear (Session 10)

**Critical Action**: When Dorwyn was possessed by the cursed spear and the party struggled to contain her, Cobbin successfully **stored the spear in his Efficient Quiver**. The extradimensional space contained the artifact's evil aura and freed Dorwyn from possession.

The party resolved to take the spear to the Lake of Light in Solaaris for purification, with Cobbin carrying it safely in extradimensional containment.

## Items

- **Efficient Quiver** (currently containing the Cursed Black Spear)
- **Elven-patterned arrows** (12 heavy arrows from ancient Sonoran warrior remains)
- Various recovered ammunition
- Curved falchion/messer blade
- Herbal salves, water skins, map-making tools

## Animals

- Helps manage the party's camels: **Faelon** (friendly) and **Seba** (irritable)

## Campaign History (Session 11)

### Duty and Distance

**The Perspective**: During the campfire scene, Cobbin offered counsel to Thea about his newly manifested divine gifts. His advice was steeped in The philosophy about duty and social role: "Your role is the place where your skills would be best suited... Your path is fairly obvious no matter how anyone else feels about it."

Sid immediately called him out: "For someone who's been away from Granitekeepfell for such a long time, you do speak like a Luxeian."

Cobbin acknowledged the observation cryptically: "Stains me. In the middle of nowhere. I travel the wastes for a reason."

**Dorwyn's Mystery**: When the party discussed why Grunthar chose Dorwyn for the mission, Cobbin observed: "Everyone else here, it's fairly obvious why the greater powers of gold picked us. Up to you. There's clearly something different or special about you." He noticed her reaction when Sid mentioned missing family—recognizing that Dorwyn's response indicated she does *not* miss hers.

**Camp Routine**: Per his usual pattern, Cobbin stayed up long enough to see the dawn, cleaning up around camp and "putting things to bed" while everyone else settled in. He prayed briefly to Sol, then tucked into the sand to sleep. Last one down, first one up.

## Thematic Significance

Cobbin embodies:

- **Connection to the wild**: Viewing the desert as ally rather than enemy
- **Institutional outsider**: Serves the The Eternal The but disdains city politics
- **Supernatural sensitivity**: His First World sensitivity and land-whispering parallel Zafi's oracle senses—both characters can perceive things others cannot
