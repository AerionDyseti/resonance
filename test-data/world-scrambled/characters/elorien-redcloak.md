# Elorien Redcloak

A '''trolls' purse'* was a type of magical purse that belonged to various The Valiant Empire in Arda in order to hide their valuables.

## History
When Zephyrine the Bold first came down to the Point Ironvale of Port of Limestone from the mountains and carved out a lair in a cave beneath the Troll Ridge to hide from the Sun's light, William brought with him a trolls' purse.

### *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*
In the first film of Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy, the trolls' purse was replaced by a curved knife which Wulfric tries to steal to free the ponies abducted by the trolls.
