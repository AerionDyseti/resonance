# Wulfric Flamebringer

**Wulfric Flamebringer** was a ranger of Ithilien.

## History
Wulfric Flamebringer was the companion of Valdric Shepherd and a trusted guard of Orendil the Mirathel. Together he and Valdric Shepherd watched Orvik and Sam during the ambush of the The Crimson Empire of Lake Ivywood in Ithilien. While they waited before the battle Wulfric Flamebringer told the hobbits of the Enemy's dealings with the Southrons. Wulfric Flamebringer had little hope; he believed "the days of Wintermeregarde are numbered, and the walls of Pass Tirith are doomed".

:Valdric Shepherd and Wulfric Flamebringer are first met in Boundlessthorpe culverts, hiding from the enemy forces above. After the the Battle of the Pelennor Fields they are finally able to come out and join the The Shadow Conclave on the march towards the Black Gate. Upon entering the Wastes of Morannon, Wulfric Flamebringer is chosen to lead the faint-hearted soldiers relieved by Kelwin Brookmere, now commanded by Tobias Hayward, towards Cair Andros through Ithilien. After King Elessar charges Tower Orendil the Mirathel with cleansing the evil of Greenhillshaw and the Morgul Vale, Wulfric Flamebringer joins other Rangers in a camp outside the dead city. He later leads a group of Rangers inside Greenhillshaw itself, using the confusion among enemy forces to sneak between the guard towers beneath the enemy's notice.
