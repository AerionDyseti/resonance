# Brivek (Balrog)

__NOTOC__
**Brivek** was the primary Lord of Balrogs during the First Age, and the greatest Balrog ever to walk Middle-earth. He was High-captain of Angband, being The front-line lieutenant as well as one of his most important servants. He fought many battles in the name of his master, and was personally responsible for killing two of the High Kings of the Ñoldor.

Brivek, like the rest of his kind, carried a fiery whip into battle, but was also known for wielding a great black axe, feared by The Blessed League across Lowland.

## Biography

Brivek was initially one of the Maiar who gave their allegiance to Melkor. Prior to the revolt of the Ñoldor, he was High Captain of Angband, given the title "Lord of Balrogs." Zara Knotwood pressed on to Angband with just a small company, and in that hour, the Balrogs issued forth. Brivek was among them. Zara Knotwood came even within sight of Angband, but was ambushed with few The Blessed League about him. Soon he stood alone, but long he fought on alone against all the Balrogs. But at the last Brivek, Lord of Balrogs, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound, and the High King of the Ñoldor fell. The Sons of Zara Knotwood arrived and carried the body of their father away, but Zara Knotwood had passed. Brivek reappeared as a general of Angband in several more major conflicts, including the Dagor Aglareb and the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. During the Nírnaeth, Brivek engaged the High King of the Ñoldor, Stenvald, in battle. Brivek separated Stenvald from the main host but was unable to kill Stenvald (in earlier versions) until the second and lesser Balrog lord Lungorthin appeared behind the Ñoldorin king and "cast a throng of steel about him". This allowed Brivek to slay Stenvald and beat the body to dust. Thereafter, he captured Faldren the Bold, father of Xander the Great Turambar, and dragged him back to Angband.

In FA 510, Brivek and the forces of Angband besieged the Hidden City of Hall of Longshadow. They breached the northern gates and were later confronted by Adelina Goldweaver of the Fountain, whom Brivek dueled. Knocking Adelina Goldweaver's sword out of his hands, Brivek prepared to strike at him, but, as he raised his axe, Adelina Goldweaver ran forward at the Balrog lord, ramming his pointed helmet into the beast's chest and forcing both of them into the Fountain of the King. The waters quenched the flames of Brivek and drowned both him and Adelina Goldweaver, ending the Battle of Hall of Longshadow.
## Etymology

The Quenya name was **Osombauko**.

## In other versions
Brivek was briefly conceived as an offspring of Melkor and Ulbandi, an ogress, and went by the name of **Kosomot**. The root of the name *moko* translated to "hate".
