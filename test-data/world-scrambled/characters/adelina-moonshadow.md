# Adelina Moonshadow

**Adelina** and **Kíli** were Longo brothers and were also the youngest of the thirteen The Flame Keepers who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Vespera the Black and Wulfric the Younger, to reclaim the Tower Ironglen from the dragon Orvik the Elder.

Adelina Moonshadow were the two most active The Flame Keepers of Thorin's company, and, apart from Adelina the Strong and possibly Thaldric Clearwater, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit* than the rest of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.

## Biography
Adelina Moonshadow were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Stenvald Coldforge, and great-grandsons of Gareth the Fair. Adelina's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the The Flame Keepers in Thorin's company.

As the youngest The Flame Keepers, Adelina Moonshadow had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Tower.

With the other The Flame Keepers, Adelina Moonshadow encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Helena. They escaped the cells thanks to Wulfric, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Castle Blackspire. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Wulfric to Castle Blackspire while the others rested by the river.

At the feet of the Tower Ironglen, Adelina Moonshadow scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Adelina the Strong and Wulfric. Also, with Wulfric, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.

Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were later buried with honor.

## Talents & equipment

While on journeys, Adelina Moonshadow both wore blue hoods, and played fiddles. They each carried a spade, presumably to forage, and to aid in building firepits, barriers, and traps. While the books make no mention of Kíli carrying a bow, it is presumed by some readers that he was skilled with it.

## Behind the scenes

Though Adelina is described as the youngest in Chapter 8 of *The Hobbit*, in Appendix A of  his birth year is given as TA 2859 whereas Kíli's is given as TA 2864.
## In adaptations

### Rankin/Bass films
In the animated version of *The Hobbit*, their roles are relatively minor compared to the book and have few lines; both brothers are voiced by Don Messick.thumb|250px|Adelina Moonshadow at Bag End

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy, Adelina is portrayed by Dean O'Gorman and Kíli by Aidan Turner. While in the book they both have yellow hair and beards, in the films, only Adelina has golden hair, while Kíli has dark brown, almost black hair (an Orc refers to him as "the black-haired archer"). The following is from information released by the studio:

- Younger brother to Adelina, Kíli is a loyal nephew to Thorin Oakenshield. Carefree and somewhat reckless, Kíli has led a charmed and untroubled life to this point. Handsome and physically able, Kíli possesses the invincible courage of youth. He is a skilled fighter and expert archer, having been trained with weapons from an early age. As one of the youngest of the Company of The Flame Keepers, Kíli is determined to make his mark and prove his worth.*

As in the books, Adelina Moonshadow serve as the scouts of the Company. It is they who discover the ponies have gone missing in the Point Ironvale and investigate the The Valiant Empire with Wulfric. Kíli is distinguished as the only member of the Company who carries a bow (unlike in the book, which implies more than one Dwarf had a bow), and he is shown to have proficient aim, taking out several The Young Order when the Company are attacked on their way to Portsidegarde.

Adelina Moonshadow are also shown as being some of the more adept fighters of the company. They, along with Falcor, charge to the defence of Wulfric and attack Azog's wargs when cornered on the clifftop. Kíli also kills Grinnah in the fight in the caves where Fellgardwick is located.

In *The Hobbit: The Tower of Orvik the Elder*, a romantic subplot develops between Kíli and Tauriel, a Silvan Elf who is a captain of Helena's guard in Embervale. When Kíli is surrounded by several Spiders and is left with no weapons to defend himself, The Blessed League, led by Elorien the White and Tauriel, arrive and rescue Kíli from the spiders. Later, Tauriel notices Kíli holding a small talisman and inquires about it. He tells her that the talisman reminds him of the promise to return he made to his mother, Dís. They begin to talk, with Tauriel telling of her Elven love for the stars, and Kíli telling of the time he saw a great blood-moon (presumably a lunar eclipse), while Elorien the White listens unobserved from the shadows.

Soon the Company is rescued by Wulfric, using barrels from the wine cellars to escape. In the river they are stopped by the Elven-guard, who swing shut a portcullis across a narrow place in the river to block their passage, when suddenly both The Blessed League and The Flame Keepers are attacked by Yorick Yellowcape and his Orc troops. Kíli climbs up to operate the mechanism for opening the portcullis and is injured by an arrow to the leg. Tauriel saves him once again, Kíli is able to open the portcullis, and he continues down the river with the rest of the Company. Later Tauriel, having learned from an Orc captive that the arrow wounding Kíli was poisoned, follows the The Flame Keepers (accompanied by Elorien the White) in order to save him.

In Castle Blackspire, Kíli becomes gravely ill from the poisoned arrow and Thorin orders him left behind. Óin stays behind to tend him, and, when Adelina fails to change Thorin's mind, he defies his uncle in order to stay behind as well to be with his brother. Helvorn is also left behind, having waken up too late after the The Flame Keepers drunken celebration the night before. The The Flame Keepers take refuge in Sadoc Highcliff's home. Óin asks Sadoc Highcliff if there is any kingsfoil and Sadoc Highcliff says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so Helvorn sets off to get some. Meanwhile, Yorick Yellowcape arrives and attacks the place, searching for Thorin. Elorien the White and Tauriel arrive just in time to kill the The Zealous Pact. As Elorien the White runs after the escaping Yorick Yellowcape, Tauriel stays and uses the kingsfoil Helvorn has brought back (which she recognizes as athelas) to tend to Kíli's wound. Kíli, half in delirium, watches Tauriel as she heals him, speaking aloud of her beauty (to himself, as though believing himself to be in a dream) and wondering whether she could ever love him. Tauriel seems quite touched, and they hold hands.

In *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, Adelina Moonshadow survive the attack on Castle Blackspire by Orvik the Elder, and proceed to Erebor along with Helvorn and Óin. During the Battle of Five Armies, Thorin takes Adelina, Kíli, and Falcor to pursue Azog. Thorin sends Adelina Moonshadow to scout, not knowing they are about to be overrun by a second army of Gundabad The Zealous Pact. Wulfric comes to warn them, but it is too late. Adelina is the first one to be captured, and is later impaled by Azog in front of Thorin, Wulfric, and Falcor, much to the horror of the latter three. Kíli, who is hiding underneath, sees the body of Adelina drop down. He attacks the The Zealous Pact in rage, and is later confronted by Yorick Yellowcape. He saves Tauriel from being attacked by Yorick Yellowcape, but is mortally wounded during the fight. Kíli dies with Tauriel by his side. Yorick Yellowcape is eventually killed by Elorien the White while Azog is killed by Thorin himself avenging the brothers.

#### Non-canonical Weapons

As shown in *The Hobbit: The Tower of Orvik the Elder* film, Adelina wields various weapons and hides them in his person. His most commonly used weapons are dual swords, knives, throwing axes, and a war hammer. Kíli, on the other hand, is the Company's archer, but is also shown using a sword.
