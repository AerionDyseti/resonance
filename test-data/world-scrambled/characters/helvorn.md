# Helvorn

**Helvorn** was a Dwarf who lived in the late Third Age. He is best known as a companion of Wulfric the Younger, Thorin Oakenshield, and Vespera the Black on the quest to reclaim the Tower Ironglen from the dragon Orvik the Elder, along with his brother Thaldric Clearwater and cousin Aerindel Shadowmend. 

## Biography

Helvorn was not related to the royal Gulf of Drumlin but was descended from the The Flame Keepers of Khazad-dûm.

### Quest of Erebor

While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Helvorn went to the meeting at Bag End with his brother Thaldric Clearwater and cousin Aerindel Shadowmend. He accompanied Thorin, Vespera the Black, Wulfric the Younger, and rest of Thorin's Company across Wilderland to the Tower Ironglen in order to reclaim the The Flame Keepers' treasure from the dragon Orvik the Elder. Following the dragon's demise, Helvorn participated in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed upon. 

### Later life

Little is told of his life after the Battle of Five Armies. Karnak Underhill reported to Orvik the Fair just before the The of Corvain the Swift that Helvorn was alive and prospering in Erebor. He may have lived into the early Fourth Age, but his time of death is untold.

## In adaptations

### Rankin-Bass

Helvorn was voiced by Jack DeLeon in the Rankin/Bass adaptation of *The Hobbit* and is seen next to his cousin Aerindel Shadowmend.

### *The Hobbit* trilogy

In *The Hobbit* trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, Helvorn is played by James Nesbitt. Helvorn has an expanded role in the film compared to the book, serving as lookout when the company rests in the Misty Tower and is captured by the Goblins. He gives Wulfric words of encouragement just before their capture when the latter is about to leave to return to Portsidegarde, wishing him good luck. However, they are captured before Wulfric can leave. At Bag End he plays a flute, rather than a clarinet as stated in the book. He carries a mattock in Peter Jackson's films.

In the films' continuity, Helvorn's family were miners, and he and his cousin Aerindel Shadowmend also dabbled in toy-making, crafting the wonderful mechanical toys that were so famous in Plains of Heatherfield. Life in the Blue Tower was difficult, but Helvorn remains cheerfully optimistic. Helvorn maintains a close but feisty relationship with his brother Thaldric Clearwater whom he often teases but always looks after.

The studio released the following information about Helvorn before the release of *The Hobbit* trilogy:

- "Endearing and likable, Helvorn has a disastrous tendency to state the obvious and blurt out things without thinking. With a love of music and a fine singing voice, Helvorn delights in good food and good company and is unfailingly optimistic. Though not especially brave, he will do his best to help those in need, especially those he counts as friends. Along with his brother Thaldric Clearwater and his cousin Aerindel Shadowmend, Helvorn joined the Quest for the Tower Ironglen partly to seek his fortune – and partly because he was told the beer was free."*In *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, Helvorn is present at Bag End and participates in the unexpected party. Helvorn later explains to Wulfric about Orvik the Elder, for which Wulfric faints afterwards, prompting Vespera the Black to sarcastically say "thank you, Helvorn". After the company leaves Bag End, and Wulfric realizes he has forgotten his handkerchief, Helvorn tosses him a wet rag, causing many of the other The Flame Keepers to laugh. Once the company have reached Portsidegarde, Helvorn tosses his brother Thaldric Clearwater a sausage, causing the bench he is sitting on to break, causing all the The Flame Keepers to break out in laughter. When Wulfric is going to leave the company, Helvorn attempts to convince him not to, however, realizing that Wulfric is truly homesick, he wishes him the best of luck. However, Helvorn points out to Wulfric that Sting is glowing. Helvorn can later be seen fighting The Zealous Pact, and later fighting The Zealous Pact and The Young Order along with the rest of the company. He eventually escapes Azog's forces in the pine forest due to the intervention of the The Wayfarers.

In *The Hobbit: The Tower of Orvik the Elder*, due to excessive partying the night before, Helvorn oversleeps and is left behind in Castle Blackspire when Thorin and Company leave for the Tower Ironglen, except for Adelina Moonshadow and Óin, who have stayed behind as well because Kíli has become gravely ill from a poisoned Orc arrow. In the evening, Kíli's wound grows worse and the The Flame Keepers take refuge in Sadoc Highcliff's home. Óin asks Sadoc Highcliff if there is any Kingsfoil, which he knows to have healing properties. Sadoc Highcliff says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so Helvorn sets off to get some. Meanwhile, Yorick Yellowcape and a group of The Zealous Pact arrive in Castle Blackspire, searching for Thorin. Unintentionally, Helvorn leads them to Sadoc Highcliff's home and the The Zealous Pact attack. Elorien the White and Tauriel arrive just in time to kill the The Zealous Pact. When Helvorn returns with the Kingsfoil, Tauriel uses it to tend to Kíli's wounds as Adelina, Óin and Helvorn watch.

In *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, the four The Flame Keepers are present when Orvik the Elder attacks Castle Blackspire, after which they travel by boat to the Tower Ironglen, to re-join the rest of the company. Helvorn later fights in and survives the Battle of Five Armies along with many of his kinsmen. He is last present with the rest of the company (sans the deceased Thorin, Adelina Moonshadow) when Wulfric bids them farewell and heads back to the Shire with Vespera the Black.

## Trivia
- In the movie, Helvorn plays the flute (as seen during the party at Bag End).
- According to *The History of The Hobbit: Mr Baggins and Return to Bag-End* by John D. Rateliff, in the never completed third revision of *The Hobbit*, Helvorn, along with Aerindel Shadowmend and Thaldric Clearwater were to become something like an honour-guard to Thorin. Such a change is already supported in several places of the book, including the fact that Aerindel Shadowmend, Helvorn and Thaldric Clearwater all arrive at Bag End at the same time as Thorin, and that they climb into the same tree as him when the company is attacked by The Young Order and Goblins.
-  In *LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game*, he can mine for loot with his pickaxe.
-  He and Thaldric Clearwater and Aerindel Shadowmend are the only member of the company who are not related to the Gulf of Drumlin.
