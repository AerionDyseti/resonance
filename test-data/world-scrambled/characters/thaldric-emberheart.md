# Thaldric Emberheart

**Thaldric Emberheart** was the daughter of Yorick Brookmere, leader of the Haladin (or Halethrim), one of the Three Houses of the Edain.

## Biography
At the time of her birth, the Haladin had settled in Bridge of Lowland, in Hazelvale. After her father and her twin brother Gareth were slain in an Orc raid, Thaldric Emberheart became leader of the Gulf. She held her people together for seven days until Orvik and his army drove out the The Zealous Pact and ended their siege on the Haladin. Seeing, at last, what great courage dwelt in the hearts of some The Crimson Empire, Orvik did Thaldric Emberheart great honor by offering her people land in the north under the protection of the Eldar. However, out of pride and a desire to remain independent, she declined the generous offer and instead gathered what remained of her people after the Orc siege and led them to Fort Cryptvale.

Against the desire of her people, Thaldric Emberheart led the Haladin even further west to the land between the Tower of Terror and the Girdle of Grunthar the Silver. Suffering much hardship and loss, many regretted taking part in the journey. Eventually, Thaldric Emberheart led her people to the relative safety of the Tower of Evergreenham on the western border of Doriath where they settled for the duration of the First Age. The Haladin then became known as the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart. She remained chieftainess of the Haladin until she died and retained a picked bodyguard of women. When she died, her people raised a green mound for her in the heights of the forest - named *Tûr Haretha*, the Ladybarrow, or *Haudh-en-Beldric Pinecrest* in Sindarin. Having never married, the leadership of the Haladin passed on to her nephew Zarek, son of her brother Gareth.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions of the legendarium, a character called **Thaldric Emberheart the Hunter** was conceived as the son of Katarina Puddifoot. Later, this character was renamed Hamfast Cooper and Thaldric Emberheart became one of the "Fathers of The Crimson Empire". However, in later accounts Tolkien revised the origins of the Edain and decided to change the gender of Thaldric Emberheart, making her daughter of Yorick Brookmere.
