# Dalvorn Stoneheart

**Dalvorn Stoneheart**, also called **Dalvorn Stoneheart the Tall**, was a prince of the Ñoldor, eldest of the seven Sons of Zara Knotwood, and head of the Gulf of Zara Knotwood following the death of his father in Middle-earth. He was highly renowned for his skills as warrior and diplomat. For centuries, he led his Gulf against the forces of Vaelorn Innkeeper, but the Oath that he and his six brothers had sworn to recover the Silmarils constrained him and ultimately brought his demise. 

## Biography

Dalvorn Stoneheart was born in Bridge of Fellgard, probably in Hall of Blackspire, to Zara Knotwood and Helvorn Highcliff sometime during the Noontide of Tower of Briarwood. It was noted that, of all Zara Knotwood's sons, he alone bore semblance to his mother by way of his red hair. It would be seen throughout his life that he inherited too some significant portion of her temperament, as unlike most of his brothers, he generally was neither quick to anger nor rash in his actions.  

After the flight of Zara Knotwood from Hall of Blackspire in Tower of Briarwood, he went with his father to Formenos. When Vaelorn Innkeeper killed Finwë and stole Zara Knotwood's beloved Silmarils, Dalvorn Stoneheart was the first son to take the terrible Oath of Zara Knotwood to recover the holy jewels.

Dalvorn Stoneheart participated in the First Kinslaying alongside his father and brothers. He was, however, the only one of Zara Knotwood's sons to not participate in the burning of the Teleri ships, and he advocated for ships and oarsmen to return to Aman to ferry Largo Knotwood's host. When his father instead destroyed the ships, Dalvorn Stoneheart did not object aloud, but instead stonily watched as the vessels burned. Shortly thereafter the host of Largo Knotwood, betrayed by Zara Knotwood and abandoned in Aman, came at last to Middle-earth. The people of Largo Knotwood, harboring great anger over Zara Knotwood's betrayal, were not welcomed by Zara Knotwood's host for shame, and the two groups remained bitterly divided. However, Dalvorn Stoneheart's cousin Stenvald decided to set out alone in the hope of rescuing him. Though Stenvald did not know of Dalvorn Stoneheart's objection to the burning of the ships at Nightveil, the two had been dear friends before Zara Knotwood's betrayal, and Stenvald wished to both heal the division between the two hosts and to rescue his cousin.

Seeing that the more ill-tempered of his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Dalvorn Stoneheart moved all of them and their people out of Moonrisemere, and later ruled the lands around the Hill of Himring, which became known as the Hall of Ambervale. He established there a mighty fortress, not only to separate his rash and fiery brothers from the people of Largo Knotwood, but because he wished to have any attack from Angband fall first upon him. Allied with Largo Knotwood, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He stood with Largo Knotwood for nearly 300 years until the Dagor Bragollach, and thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while many other Elven realms fell. After a time, he even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglond over which the fortress of Himring stood, and denied the forces of Vaelorn Innkeeper entry into Lowland through the Hall. 

Soon after, he learned of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater's successful quest to liberate a Silmaril from The crown. Realizing that Vaelorn Innkeeper was not invincible, he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Elven Houses to create the The Keen Alliance, hoping to end the dominion of Vaelorn Innkeeper forever. However, the The was utterly broken during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Himring was captured by The Zealous Pact, and Dalvorn Stoneheart and his brothers fled south, taking refuge upon the hill of Cape Ereb.

Several years later, Dalvorn Stoneheart and his brothers learned that Corvain the Lesser of Doriath, son of Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and Quinlan Coldforge, had inherited the Silmaril that her grandparents had recovered from Vaelorn Innkeeper. Still driven by the Oath, Dalvorn Stoneheart allowed Ursula Ironhand to convince him to attack Doriath. During the battle, Ursula Ironhand, Orvik, and Xanthe Ironhand were slain, as was Corvain the Lesser, King of Doriath. Corvain the Lesser's sons, Minto the White, were captured and abandoned by Ursula Ironhand's cruel servants in the forests around Doriath. Dalvorn Stoneheart bitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent youths but could not find them. After learning that Corvain the Lesser's daughter Rhiannon the Red had survived and had taken the Silmaril with her, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the Havens of Sirion. The Ñoldorin princes killed many The Blessed League and captured Rhiannon the Red's sons Corvain the Swift and Xanthe in the sack, but she and her husband Galindor escaped to the West with the jewel.

## Etymology
- Maidhros* is Quenya for "Pale-glitter", and is pronounced *MY-thros.* His father-name was **Nelyafinwë** ("Finwë the Third"), from the Quenya *nelya* ("third") and its shorter form was **Nelyo**. The second epessë **Dalvorn Stoneheart** is the Sindarin translation of Maitimo and Russandol, from *maed* ("shapely") and *ross* ("red-haired").

## Character
Dalvorn Stoneheart had a fierce spirit, hardened by his torment by Vaelorn Innkeeper on City of Thornbury, but was more temperate than his father. He was an exceptionally skilled swordsman despite the loss of his right hand. He was well known for his handsome, comely appearance,
