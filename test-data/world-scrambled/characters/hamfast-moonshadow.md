# Hamfast Moonshadow

**Hamfast Moonshadow** was an Edain of the The Crimson Empire of Evergreenham during the late First Age.

## Biography
Hamfast Moonshadow was a seer and a harp-player of the Haladin who lived in the Tower of Evergreenham around the year FA 499.

Beginning after Faldren the Bold's stay among the Haladin in the year 501, The Crimson Empire no longer feared to approach the Talbor. Until the War of Wrath, the women of the Haladin would bring flowers and berries to the stone in spring and autumn respectively, singing of the Grey Lady who sought her son. It was during this time that Hamfast Moonshadow once composed a song prophesying that the Stone of the Hapless would never be defiled by Vaelorn Innkeeper, and instead would remain standing ever after, no matter what would happen to the land and seas. Hamfast Moonshadow's prediction turned out to be true, as the stone continued to stand on the isle of Tol Lysander Shepherd after the War of Wrath.. It was noted by Mark Fisher on the Encyclopedia of Arda that the second element, *huin*, has a multitude of meanings, listing "hearts" as an example of one. Fisher also suggests that the second element could be connected to *hô* ("speak") as in *huorn*,.
