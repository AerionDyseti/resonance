## Role/Occupation

Conductor of the Phalanx of Faith at the Imitradi Outpost City; former Death Knight/War Cleric

## Description

A Death Knight who leads the undead priests in their dark litany at the desecrated Outpost City. He commands a legion of Wight Acolytes and Wraith Chanters who perform the perverted hymns that form one note of the Marching.

## Background

Nolan the Younger served the Starfather in life as a War Cleric champion. Now he is forced to lead the blasphemous chanting at the very shrine he once protected. His +1 Plate Armor—exquisite Elven make with the uncorrupted, silver-inlaid crest of the Starfather—lies frozen and discarded in the commander's quarters, replaced by unholy armor.

## Bound Against His Will

**Nolan the Younger is NOT a true believer.** He is one of the undead who are bound by oaths and promises they cannot break past death. His soul-pact in the Reliquary of Names forces him to serve, but his spirit resists. The priests under his command are similarly trapped, their faith inverted against their will.

## The Ritual

The Phalanx chants actual, real hymns of the Starfather, but with key words twisted:

- "Life" is replaced with "Service"
- "Sleep" with "Vigil"
- "The Stars' Light" with "The Queen's Frost"

This creates the "sound" that powers this phalanx—forced chanting and blasphemous prayer at the desecrated statue of the Starfather.

## Potential Social Solutions

Since Kaelen is bound against his will, he may be:

- **Freed** if his binding scroll in the Reliquary is destroyed
- **Aided** through the Hearth Hymn—the original, uncorrupted text found in a scorched prayer book
- A PC can initiate a **Litany Duel** (DC 25 Religion or Performance), out-chanting the perverted hymn with the true words of the faith

## Combat Notes

- Bolstered by the statue's unhallow effect (granting advantage on saves vs. spells to undead within 30 ft)
- The ritual is anchored by three points: the Conductor, the chained statue, and the banner
- Unpinning the banner breaks the unhallow effect and deals psychic damage to all undead

## Rewards

- **The Banner**: Unpinning grants: Lose +2 saves vs. turn/charm; next Resonant Command fails in final fight
- **The Hearth Hymn**: Found in scorched prayer book; grants: Cancel one lair action
- **Kaelen's Armor**: +1 Plate Armor with Starfather's silver crest (discarded in dormitory)

## Notes

- One of the four black binding scrolls is likely linked to him as a phalanx captain
- The party explored the Outpost City but may not have fully engaged this phalanx yet
