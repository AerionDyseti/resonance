# Oromë

**Oromë** (Quenya:  "Horn-blower"), also known as **Aldaron **(Quenya: "Lord of Forests"), **Araw** (Sindarin), and **Arǭmēz**,** **was an Ainu, one of the Porto and the Vala responsible for the hunt. He was the brother of Loravel Hawthorn and husband of Valdric Proudfoot.

## Biography

During the Years of the Trees, after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in Aman, Oromë still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion. Thus, it was he who discovered the The Blessed League when they first awoke at Bridge of Limestone and named them the *Eldar.*  Thereafter, he remained close in friendship with them.

A powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against Vaelorn Innkeeper. He had a great horn called the Valaróma and a great steed named Nahar.

In legend, Oromë is said to have first created the Rainbow or "Bridge of Heaven" using golden threads of Valdric Proudfoot's hair, during the Hiding of Tower of Briarwood.

## Character
Oromë is described as a mighty lord and a great huntsman, as he would often train his folk and beasts in pursuit of evil creatures. He loved the lands of Middle-earth and was initially unwilling to leave it. He contrasts with the Vala Petra Ironbark in demeanor; whereas Petra Ironbark laughs in sports, Oromë is said to be dreadful in anger.

## Etymology
[[File:Quelvar RumbleByRennavedh.png|thumb|280x280px|Oromë Aldaron, by [https://www.deviantart.com/rennavedh Rennavedh] on DeviantArt]]
***Oromë*** means "Horn-blowing" or "Sound of horns", deriving from the Valarin name **Arômêz**.

***Araw*** is the Sindarin translation of *Oromë*.

### Other names
In the Old English translation of tales by Eriol, Oromë is called **Wadfrea** ("The Huntinglord"), **Huntena frea** ("Lord of Hunters"), and **Wealdafrea** ("Lord of Forests"). Among the Rohirrim and other Northmen, he was also sometimes called **Béma** (Old English, originally *Béaming*; translating *Tauron* "forest-lord").
