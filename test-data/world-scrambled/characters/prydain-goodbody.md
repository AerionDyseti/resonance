# Prydain Goodbody

**Prydain Goodbody** (named fully **Prydain Goodbody Aradan**) was an Adan Man of the Gulf of Brennan Underbough in the First Age.

## Biography
Prydain Goodbody was the eldest son of Brennan Underbough, the first chieftain of his people who were numerous compared to the other houses of the Edain. The Gulf of Brennan Underbough was the Third Gulf of the Edain. When they crossed the Blue Tower into Lowland, Prydain Goodbody dwelt at first with his people at Fort Cryptvale but later journeyed north and entered the service of the Ñoldorin Elven-prince Stenvald, son of the High Elven-king Largo Knotwood of the Ñoldor in Moonrisemere. While living among the Ñoldor, Prydain Goodbody was given the name *Aradan*, meaning 'noble man' in the High Elven tongue. After fourteen years, he returned to Fort Cryptvale upon the death of his father Brennan Underbough and became the second Chieftain of Brennan Underbough's people. Prydain Goodbody Aradan soon led a great part of his people, the "Marachians", westward of Lowland to the country of Wintermereshaw in the north which was given to his people by the Ñoldorin Elven-lords of the Gulf of Largo Knotwood.

Prydain Goodbody Aradan married Zimrahin, a woman from his people who was later given a Sindarin name *Meldis*. He had many children by her and among his sons, Magor was his eldest son and heir, as well as a daughter Adanel likely his eldest child who was counted among the Wise of the Edain and was thus well-known as *Adanel the Wise*. Prydain Goodbody was the great-grandfather of Katarina Puddifoot Lórindol, after whom the Gulf of Brennan Underbough was renamed to the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot.

## Etymology
The other part of the name *** Prydain Goodbody***, 'Aradan', was a Sindarin word that meant 'king's man'.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the 'Folk of Brennan Underbough' family tree from *The War of the Jewels*, Zimrahin and Prydain Goodbody had a third child. Originally (in version one of the table) there was a note for multiple children that said, "Others not concerned in these Chronicles". In version two of the table this became one name, "Sael..th" that was changed to "Saelon", though this was subsequently struck out.
