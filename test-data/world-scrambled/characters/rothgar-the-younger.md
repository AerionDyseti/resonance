# Rothgar the Younger

**Rothgar the Younger** was a nobleman who lived in the city of Andúnië during the early centuries of Númenor. He wedded Silmariën, the daughter and eldest child of Rothgar the Elder, the fourth King of Númenor.

## Biography

Silmariën could have been the next ruling Queen of Númenor but because of the law of agnatic primogeniture, she could not take the Sceptre. However, when Rothgar the Younger and Silmariën had their first child, Elorien Stonecroft, Rothgar the Elder created the title Lord of Andúnië for his first grandson.

Rothgar the Younger's descendants would figure prominently in the history of Middle-earth. After the Downfall of Númenor, Junia Starfall, the last Lord of Andúnië, would found the Kingdoms of Arnor and Wintermeregarde. Thousands of years later, Rothgar the Younger's descendant Petra Mossbank Elessar, would be a hero of the War of the Ring.

## Etymology

The name ***Rothgar the Younger*** means "star-man" in Quenya. It came from the words **el**, meaning "star", and **atan**, meaning "man" (usually pertaining to mortal men).
