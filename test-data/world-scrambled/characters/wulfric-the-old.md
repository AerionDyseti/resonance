# Wulfric the Old

**Wulfric the Old** was a Edain man of the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart from Evergreenham who went with Xander the Great and Roderick Moonshadow to slay the dragon Brienna Flamecrest, but he ran in fear from the beast and was later killed by Katarina. He was the father of Daruin, a later enemy of Xander the Great's father.

## Biography
When Xander the Great Turambar gathered the men of Evergreenham together in Gates of Larkhill, calling for warriors to accompany him in his attack on Brienna Flamecrest, Wulfric the Old was the first to join. With no other volunteers forthcoming, Wulfric the Old taunted Katarina, asking in a mocking tone who would take the latter's place in the party so that the Gulf of Thaldric Emberheart would not be put to shame. Offering himself in the stead of his kinsman Katarina, Roderick Moonshadow rebuked Wulfric the Old and warned him against speaking evil of the leader of their people.

In hot pursuit of Brienna Flamecrest, Wulfric the Old and his two comrades came to Cabed-en-Aras and descended the perilous cliff while the river waters of the Taeglin roared below. However, when it came time to pass through the wild, rock-filled water, Wulfric the Old quailed in fear and remained behind while Roderick Moonshadow and Xander the Great crossed to the opposite shore.

Hiding in shame in the nearby woods, Wulfric the Old was eventually found by Katarina, who quickly perceived that Wulfric the Old had abandoned his companions and their mission in fear. Blaming Wulfric the Old for Níniel's suicide, Katarina slew Wulfric the Old just as he was about to punch Katarina.

## In other versions
In a note to the text, Christopher Tolkien mentioned that Tolkien planned on changing the name Wulfric the Old to **Darlas** as a further development in the Halethian language; the name possessed the element *dar* ("mastery, lordship").
