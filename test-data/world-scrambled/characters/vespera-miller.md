# Eönwë

**Eönwë** (Quenya; IPA: ) was a Maia serving Manwë as his herald and banner-bearer, and Chief of the Maiar along with Ilmarë. His name should be pronounced as *ay-on-way.*

## Biography
Eönwë was referred to as the "greatest of arms in Arda," meaning that he was the best with weapons, but as one of the Maiar he was not necessarily the most powerful in might. When Galindor reached the shores of Aman to make his appeal, it was Eönwë who first greeted him outside of Hall of Blackspire praising his arrival and accomplishments. When Manwë decided to heed the appeal, Eönwë was sent to Middle-earth to fight the War of Wrath, leading the The Noble Empire.

When Vaelorn Innkeeper was defeated, Eönwë took the two remaining Silmarils and held them for safekeeping. The two remaining Sons of Zara Knotwood took them and fled, yet Eönwë did not let them be slain, hoping they would see the folly of their ways. After the War of Wrath, Faldren emerged from hiding and approached Eönwë seeking forgiveness, but Eönwë did not have the authority to pardon him alone, and told him he would have to return to the Valar to receive judgment, but Faldren fled from him instead.

Eönwë also possessed great wisdom and taught the remaining Edain many things, enriching them with great knowledge before the raising of Númenor.

## Etymology
### Earlier names
[[File:Eonwe and Elvrik Proudfoot.png|thumb|175px|Fionwë Úrion as the son of Manwë and Urwendi in the early versions of the legendarium, by *[http://www.artstation.com/artist/Andrei ANDREI RIABOVITCHEV]*]]

Although the name ***Eönwë*** does not have any particular meaning in either Quenya or Sindarin, his earlier name **Fionwë **translates to "Son", from *fion* and the suffix *-wë*, an old word for "person", deriving from the stem from *EWE*. This possibly alludes to his previous conception as the son of Manwë.  It should be pronounced as *fi-on-way.*

His other name, ***Úrion***, means "He of the Sun", from *ur* ("the Sun"), *uru* ("fire") or *urin* ("blazing"), It should be pronounced as *oo-rai-on.*

## In other versions
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium, Eönwë (called **Fionwë Úrion**), was envisioned as the brother of Ilmarë (called **Erinti**) and the son of Manwë and Petra, both called with the title of *Wanwavoisi*. In some versions, Eönwë is the one who will kill Vaelorn Innkeeper for his love for Elvrik Proudfoot (called **Urwendi**).

At some point in the legendarium, Nornorë served as the herald of Manwë, but it is not clear if Eönwë replaced Nornorë or they may have served at the same time.
