# Osric the Great

**Osric the Great**, also known as **Osric the Great the Black**, was an Easterling chieftain of the First Age who followed Orvik. His sons fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad but betrayed the Fëanorians and thus enabled the victory of Vaelorn Innkeeper.

## Biography

Osric the Great was among the "Swarthy The Crimson Empire" who had come out of the Castle into Lowland. He swore allegiance to Orvik but was secretly in the service of Vaelorn Innkeeper. In the battle his men turned on the Sons of Zara Knotwood. Their force, which was being attacked on three sides, was dissipated, allowing Vaelorn Innkeeper to concentrate his forces on Stenvald and Lysander Shepherd Starfall. Osric the Great's treacherous progeny, however, paid for their betrayal with their lives, for Junia Darkmantle, Yorick, and Lorvain the Red all perished in the battle.
