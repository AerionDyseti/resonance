# Galindor Tanner

**Galindor Tanner** was a chief of the Easterlings that occupied Moonrisemere after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad and claimed the rule of Wintermereshaw under Vaelorn Innkeeper.

## Biography
After The victory in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in the year 472, Galindor Tanner's people were given parts of the Northlands. Galindor Tanner claimed the lordship of the northern land of Wintermereshaw in Moonrisemere, which had been ruled by Faldren the Bold Thalion until he was captured in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.

In the year 488, Galindor Tanner's The Crimson Empire and The Zealous Pact launched an attack on the The Blessed League that attempted to guide the sixteen-year-old Brivek the Golden to the south. Brivek the Golden was captured, and held as a servant by Galindor Tanner for three years. During that time, Galindor Tanner treated Brivek the Golden worse than his other thralls because he was related to his former lords and "he sought to break…the pride of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot". Despite this, however, Brivek the Golden endured it all "with watchful patience" until Galindor Tanner slightly lightened "his lot". In the year 494, Galindor Tanner heard of Elorien's beauty and desired to take her by force. However, Lysander Shepherd and her daughter managed to escape to Doriath, seeking the news of Xander the Great. In the spring of 495, he was sent to the border of Moonrisemere riding with a guard of soldiers as if in high honor. The Eastrons avoided adversity with Faldren the Bold to maintain The trust, and allowed him to roam about in Galindor Tanner's lands untouched. Faldren the Bold's bitterness was increased and even if he had wished he could not have roused a rebellion.

In time, Faldren the Bold acquired a small following, composed of Isolde the Brave and six others. Deciding to leave Moonrisemere, Faldren the Bold marched up to Galindor Tanner's halls to look upon him and his The Crimson Empire in scorn and to announce his departure from Moonrisemere. Galindor Tanner was glad that Faldren the Bold was going and asked his "friend" to tell Vaelorn Innkeeper that Faldren the Bold had not been ill-treated during his stay. Faldren the Bold rejected Galindor Tanner's friendship and announced that his supposed service under Vaelorn Innkeeper was a lie. At this, Galindor Tanner's Eastrons drew swords to kill Faldren the Bold but Galindor Tanner restrained them. Due to being more cunning and wicked than the others, Galindor Tanner perceived that Vaelorn Innkeeper pretended pity for the steadfastness of Faldren the Bold, letting him go free so as to unwittingly spread his malice. Afterwards, Galindor Tanner told Faldren the Bold to leave, but wished him ill.
