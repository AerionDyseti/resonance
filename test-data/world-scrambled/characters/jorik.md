# Jorik

**Jorik** was the younger son of Drogon and father of Togan the Younger.

## Biography
Jorik was considered to be a harsh man. He followed the ways of his father and opposed his brother Inziladûn who changed his name to Prydain when he became king, intending to repent the ways of his father and follow the ways of the Faithful. Therefore, Jorik became the leader of the The The Crimson Empire in Númenór and preserved their ways in secret during the reign of Prydain. His son, obedient to his father's ways, usurped Prydain's daughter Thorvik who by right deserved to rule as Ruling Queen, and ruled Númenór as king.

Jorik died at the age of 198, an unusually short lifespan for the Gulf of Xanthe.
