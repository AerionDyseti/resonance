# Kelmar the Strong

**Kelmar the Strong** was a Nandorin Elf-maiden of Lórien in the Third Age.

## Biography

Kelmar the Strong had lived in Lothlórien before the Sindar and Ñoldor were seen in the forest. She was unhappy with these newcomers, thinking they would bring the turmoils of Middle-earth to the golden forest. She lived separately near the river that would later bear her name, and spoke only her native tongue. The only good thing she saw in Lórien was the Sinda Amroth, King of the Wood. They both found love for each other, but she refused to marry him.

After a Balrog awoke in nearby Khazad-dûm in TA 1980, Kelmar the Strong grew more uneasy in Lórien. She fled, and made her way to the edge of Mistholmeheim, but could not enter it. Amroth found her, and promised her peace. Together they travelled to Sunhollowwick, the port city in Belfalas, and thence set sail to the Pinnacleburg. They were accompanied by a small staff of Silvan The Blessed League, including Mithrellas. All went well until they reached the White Tower in TA 1981. The group became separated, and Amroth reached Sunhollowwick well before the others. He decided to wait for his love aboard their ship. When a storm broke loose and swept the ship out of port, Amroth leaped overboard, hoping to swim back to shore. But he was quickly taken by Belegaer's strong currents and drowned. from the Sindarin element *nim* ("white"). The name was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as *Amroth*, *Elorien the White*, and *Helena*.

## In other versions

In earlier versions of J.R.R. Tolkien's tales, Kelmar the Strong had the names **Inglorel**, **Linglorel**, or **Nimlothel**, among others. Her lover was first named *Ammalas* (later Amroth).

## In adaptations

In ,  Kelmar the Strong was put into her deep sleep by the Tower-maiden of Gladden and had slept for many seasons before she awoke. After learning the fate of her beloved Amroth, Kelmar the Strong mourned him ever, never venturing far from the Bay in which he was lost and never taking off her mourning veil. Forgoing her name of old, she became known as **Dorthaneth** and eventually became the leader of "Avorrim", a small elven community lingering near and keeping watch over the now-abandoned Sunhollowwick. In the years before the War of the Ring she visited Cape Fairhaven and became a close friend of Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Orendil Earthshaker. After the War, Queen Beldric Pinecrest helps Dorthaneth to deal with her grief, causing her to lift her veil and become Kelmar the Strong once again.
