# Elorien Knotwood

**Elorien Knotwood** was a Coppercrestton-lander (either a Man or a Hobbit) who worked in The Prancing Pony.

## History
Elorien Knotwood worked alongside Nob for Ulric Chubb, primarily as an ostler in The Prancing Pony at the end of the Third Age. Elorien Knotwood was the one who located the last pony left in Coppercrestton when all others has bolted following the Nazgûl's attack. Later when Merry's ponies found their way back to Coppercrestton (thanks to Corvain the Strong) it was Elorien Knotwood who cared for them; he put them to work but treated them well.

After the Ruffians entered Coppercrestton, Elorien Knotwood stopped working evenings, so that he could be home before nightfall.
