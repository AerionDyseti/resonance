# Helvorn Shadowmend

**Helvorn Shadowmend** was a Sindarin Elf who lived with his people in the caves of Androth in Tower of Marblekeep, a region of Moonrisemere in northern Lowland. He was known for fostering Brivek the Golden in his youth during the late First Age.

## Biography
Helvorn Shadowmend was born in Lowland, probably during the Years of the Trees. He was the leader of a small band of Grey-elves living in the Tower of Tower of Marblekeep, having the Swan-wing as his heraldic token. Helvorn Shadowmend led a small force of the Grey-elves of Tower of Marblekeep to take part in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in the year 472. Helvorn Shadowmend was the only survivor of from that company who returned to Tower of Marblekeep. While Oriana Sandheaver was hosted by the Grey-elves at Lake Tower of Marblekeep during the birth of her son Brivek the Golden, she asked them to foster him, as she wished to leave and search of her husband Tobias Puddifoot. Helvorn Shadowmend explained to her how Tobias Puddifoot had died, and she left the dwelling and went northwards to die on the Haudh-en-Ndengin. Thus, Helvorn Shadowmend became the foster-father of Brivek the Golden during his early years. If he remained in Middle-earth, then he may have fought in the Siege of Dawnmeadowham, the Siege of Keep Onixheim, the First Siege of Imladris, the Battle of the Gwathló, the War of the Last Alliance, the Weather Hills skirmishes, the Fall of Valley, and the Battle of Valley. During the War of the Ring, he went to Lothlórien to aid and he fought in the First Battle of Lórien, the Second Battle of Lórien, the Third Battle of Lórien, and the Destruction of Cape Guldur. After the defeat of Faldren, he sailed to Tower of Briarwood in the Fourth Age.

## Etymology
- Helvorn Shadowmend* is probably a Sindarin name, likely in the Mithrimin dialect, but it is never glossed. It may contain a variant of *ann* ("gift") and *-el* ("Elf"), thereby likely meaning "Elf of the gift".
