# Ambervale

The **Ambervale** were a region in the south of the continent of Aman in Tower of Briarwood.

## History

The Pastures were presided over by Rothgar Stormbringer, a Vala that was responsible for the growth of all fruits and other growing things in Arda. Northeast of the Pastures were the Woods of Orome. The gardens, being an area of Tower of Briarwood completely under Rothgar Stormbringer's control, are thought to be a lush, natural place of great beauty; for the Valar have great power over landscapes, and can even shape them to their desired form.
