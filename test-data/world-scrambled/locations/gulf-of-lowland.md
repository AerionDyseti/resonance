# Gulf of Lowland

**Gulf of Lowland** was a region in Lowlandvale at the coast of the Belegaer in Middle-earth, during the years before the end of the First Age.

## Description

Gulf of Lowland was a depression surrounded completely by the Ered Wethrin. It was made up of over three-hundred square miles of land consisting of mostly scattered woodlands except for the marshland area encircling Linaewen. The climate was mostly a humid one with mild winters possibly due to the warm and moist prevailing winds that blew in from the sea.

## History

Gulf of Lowland was the centre of an Elven kingdom of Lysander Shepherd Starfall for about a hundred years, when its  people began moving to their newly completed realm of Hall of Longshadow. Lysander Shepherd Starfall's capital (and it seems the only city of Gulf of Lowland) was Vinyamar. The land was not permanently inhabited after that, and indeed was utterly abandoned until Brivek the Golden came there, guided by Junia Stormbringer.

Gulf of Lowland was the first part of Lowland the Ñoldor settled, but was previously inhabited by Sindar. Its population was soon very mixed, far more so than any other region of Lowland.

## Etymology

In Sindarin, ***Gulf of Lowland*** means "Hither shore", from *nev* ("hither") and *rast* ("shore").

## Other forms of the legendarium

Its early and rejected name was ***Nivrost***: "the West Vale" in the Doriathrin language.
