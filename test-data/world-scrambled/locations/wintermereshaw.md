# Wintermereshaw

**Wintermereshaw** was a region of Moonrisemere in the First Age.

## Description

Wintermereshaw was a country in the south-western part of Moonrisemere, bordered in the east by the Tower of Tower of Marblekeep, and in the north by the river which formed the Rainbow Cleft, known as Annon-in-Gelydh, or the "Gate of the Noldor". It was the birthplace of Xander the Great, son of Faldren the Bold and Lysander Shepherd. There was also a mountain pass in its south, unknown to the Enemy.

Faldren the Bold's house was built in its south-western corner near the mountain known as Cape Dustmoor, where the river Nen Lalaith began. but in FA 416 Largo Knotwood gave it to Katarina Puddifoot. Wintermereshaw became a fief of the Third Gulf of the Edain, which flourished there, strengthened by refugees of the First Gulf from Hall of Evergreen, until the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Vaelorn Innkeeper then gave Wintermereshaw, together with the rest of Moonrisemere, to his Easterlings, who absorbed or enslaved the surviving Edain. Brivek the Golden son of Tobias Puddifoot was fostered by the The Blessed League of Androth in the Tower of Tower of Marblekeep.

Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the army of Wintermereshaw was between 12,000 and 15,000. The entire host was destroyed during the battle.

After Xander the Great fled south over the Ered Wethrin, bands of Easterlings came and attacked and enslaved the peoples of Wintermereshaw, save Lysander Shepherd, her daughter Elorien, and her servants, including Ilyndra Flamecrest Labadal. The outlaws were led by Kelwin Starfall, who wedded Roderick Juniper so that when he was dead, he would have an heir to keep the land under his family's rule. Over a year after Xander the Great came to Doriath, Lysander Shepherd and Elorien went seeking Xander the Great in City of Bronzegate. Later, Xander the Great came to seek Lysander Shepherd in Wintermereshaw, but they had already gone south over the mountains. Like the rest of Moonrisemere it was destroyed during the War of Wrath.
