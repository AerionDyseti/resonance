# Coppercrestgarde

The area of Gates of Dustmoor that lay north of Port of Limestone was known as **Coppercrestgarde**, together with the great bay and cape which carried the same name. This area roughly corresponded with the area where the Blue Tower and the Iron Tower once met.

## History

It is speculated in* The Atlas of Middle-earth* that the ancient stronghold of Vaelorn Innkeeper, Utumno, was once located in Coppercrestgarde, although this is not necessarily canonical. Coppercrestgarde was inhabited by a tribe of brown skinned people called the Lossoth, or Snowmen. The chief of these tribes sheltered the Arthedain king Arvedui for a time, and was given the Ring of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth as a reward. Arvedui soon left afterwards, and on his voyage back, the ship sank, due to a great storm.

## Etymology

***Coppercrestgarde*** is a Sindarin word that meant 'North-ice'.

## Appearances in adaptations
