# Wintermerevale

**Wintermerevale** was a mountain in the Ered Wethrin (Tower of Shadow) in western Gulf of Lowland near the coast of Lowlandvale.

Wintermerevale was tall and dark and reached high into the sky and was topped with clouds and stood high above a green cape that jutted out into the sea.

## History

The city of Vinyamar was built under it. Brivek the Golden visited here during his travels in Gulf of Lowland and was near where he spoke with Junia Stormbringer. The mountain was either destroyed during the War of Wrath or simply sunk under the sea as the rest of Lowland did at the end of the First Age.
