# Pebblebrookglen

**Pebblebrookglen**, also known as **Land of Willows**, was a region in Lowland situated around both the Narog and Sirion rivers.
__NOTOC__
The land was of modest beauty and many willow trees grew there but had few inhabitants.

## History
After the defeat of the The Keen Alliance at the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, this had become one of the many places in Lowland that The Zealous Pact and wolves roamed. In FA 511, shortly after the Fall of Hall of Longshadow, the survivors of the city, led by Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood, camped here and made their respects to the fallen.

Voronwë is said to have been very wistful of this land and considered it to be the best part of Lowland. Part of his motivation for attempting a voyage to Tower of Briarwood was based upon the grounds that there were better forests there than Pebblebrookglen.

When Barlo Lightfoot and Helvorn Wavecrest said farewell to Longo the Red following the downfall of Barad-dûr, and Helvorn Wavecrest expressed his belief that they should not meet the Ent again, Barlo Lightfoot stated that "*Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave* (Lowland) *are lifted up again. **Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan** we may meet in the Spring," *

## Etymology
***Nan-Tathren*** was also called **The Land of Willows** or **Valley of the Willows**, and was ***Nan-tasarion*** ('Willow-meads') in Quenya.
