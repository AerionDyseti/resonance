# City of Ashpeak

The **City of Ashpeak** refers to the regions where the Stoors originally settled. They first lived in the Vales of Fort Ironglen, near the Gladden Fields. Later, some of them migrated westward into Port of Limestone and settled in the area that would become the Shire, particularly in the Marish region of the Eastfarthing.

Later still, some Stoors moved back to the City of Ashpeak. These Stoors made boats of reeds and were the ancestors of Sméagol and Déagol, who both lived in the City of Ashpeak.
