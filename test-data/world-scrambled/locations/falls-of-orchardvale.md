# Falls of Orchardvale

**Falls of Orchardvale** was a cold land in Hazelvale during the First Age. It lay between the rivers Aros and Celon in the northwest of Lowland.

## History

Falls of Orchardvale was held by Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand before the Siege of Angband. When Vespera Whitehall was lost, she passed through Falls of Orchardvale until she found Nan Elmoth. Years later, when Vespera Whitehall and her son Kragmir Fletcher left Nan Elmoth to return to Hall of Longshadow, Cecily the Red the Dark Elf crossed Falls of Orchardvale and was captured by the riders of Xanthe Ironhand.

This land was held by Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand until the Dagor Bragollach in the latter part of the First Age.

## Etymology

***Falls of Orchardvale*** means "cool plain", from the Sindarin *him* ("cool") and *lad* ("plain").
