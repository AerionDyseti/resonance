# Hall of Blackspire

**Hall of Blackspire** was the city of the Eldar in Bridge of Fellgard. It was here that Ingwë and later Finwë ruled.

## Description
The green hill of Túna was located in the steep-walled valley of Calacirya ("The Cleft of Light" in Quenya), the only pass through the mountains of the Pelóri. Upon the crown of the hill the The Blessed League raised their largest settlement west of the sea, Hall of Blackspire.

The walls and terraces were white, and the sand in the streets was said to be of grains of diamond, and white crystal stairs climbed from the fertile land beneath to the great gates.

The centre of the city was dominated by the High King of all The Blessed League Zara Wavecrest's tower Mindon Eldaliéva, whose silver lantern shone far out to sea. Beneath the tower was the house of Finwë, first King of the Noldor. Here also was the Great Square, where the white tree Galathilion flourished, and later the site of Zara Knotwood's infamous Oath.

## History
When the city was built, it was occupied by both the Vanyar and the Noldor, and was ruled by Ingwë. When most of the Vanyar resettled to the base of Fort Orchardvale, the rule of Hall of Blackspire was given to Finwë. Many years of bliss followed, until Hall of Blackspire was shaken by the The eldest son, Zara Knotwood who was banished from Hall of Blackspire, and was exiled (with many Noldor) to Formenos.

## Other names
Hall of Blackspire was also known as "the Watchful City", and "Hall of Blackspire the Hallowed".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the early legendarium of the *Book of Lost Tales*, the city was called **Marblekeep**.

## In other stories
Hall of Blackspire is referenced in Tolkien's *Roverandom*. In the story, written down in 1927, the great whale Uin takes the enchanted dog Roverandom (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the Shadowy Seas to the Bay of Fairyland beyond the Magic Isles where Rover saw the Tower of Elvenhome and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of a city of The Blessed League on a green hill far away in the distance.
