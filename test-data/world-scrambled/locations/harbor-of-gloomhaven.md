## Overview

Harbor of Gloomhaven is a once-thriving city within The The Crystal Syndicate that has fallen into decline over the past several decades. Though it retains vestiges of its former glory, much of the city now lies abandoned, a shadow of the vibrant trading center it once was.

## Geography and Climate

Located in the eastern region of Bridge, Harbor of Gloomhaven is situated near the coast with what was once a strategic harbor. The city experiences mild seasons with moderate rainfall throughout the year. The surrounding agricultural lands have largely been reclaimed by nature, with wild growth encroaching on the city's outskirts.

## History

Founded several centuries ago as a trading outpost, Harbor of Gloomhaven once stood as one of Bridge's most prominent urban centers. However, fifty years ago, a devastating plague known as "the Gray Wasting" swept through the city, decimating its population. The republic's harsh quarantine measures, while necessary to contain the disease, led to the city's economic collapse when trade routes were permanently diverted to safer ports.

## Government and Politics

Once governed by a prestigious local council, Harbor of Gloomhaven now falls under the direct administration of a small contingent of officials from the republic's central government. Most political power has been withdrawn from the city, with minimal resources allocated to its maintenance or revival.

## Economy

Harbor of Gloomhaven's once-diverse economy has collapsed to a mere fraction of its former glory. The once-bustling port now sees only occasional fishing vessels and the rare merchant ship. Most inhabitants who remain subsist through small-scale farming, fishing, and salvaging materials from abandoned structures. A modest black market has emerged, dealing in artifacts recovered from the city's empty mansions and warehouses.

## Culture

The vibrant cultural scene that once defined Harbor of Gloomhaven has largely disappeared with its departed population. Those who remain maintain somber traditions commemorating the city's fall, including the annual "Lantern Night" when lights are placed in windows of abandoned buildings to remember those lost to the plague and exodus.

## Notable Locations

- The Harbor District - Once-bustling docks now largely empty, with decaying warehouses and collapsed piers
- The's Quarter - Abandoned shops and market squares, partially reclaimed by vegetation
- The Citadel - Minimally staffed administrative center housing the republic's small contingent of officials
- Old Town - Partially inhabited historic district where most remaining residents cluster
- The Quarantine Walls - Massive stone barriers erected during the plague that now stand as a grim memorial

## Notable Figures

- Administrator Kell Vorne - Republic-appointed official overseeing what remains of Harbor of Gloomhaven
- Captain Mara Stillwater - Commander of the small garrison tasked with preventing looting
- Elder Tomas Vex - Descendant of the once-powerful The's Guild leader, now keeper of the city's history
- Lina Ashfoot - Self-proclaimed "Mayor of the Remnant," unofficial leader of those who chose to remain

## Current State

Despite its decline, Harbor of Gloomhaven has attracted a small community of scholars studying the plague's effects and architects documenting the city's unique structures before they collapse entirely. Some in the republic's government have proposed revival projects, but funding and political will remain insufficient. Rumors persist of valuable artifacts and wealth still hidden in sealed mansions and guild halls, attracting treasure hunters despite the garrison's efforts to keep them away.
