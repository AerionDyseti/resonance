# Fort Ashpeak

**Fort Ashpeak** was the southern division of the Elven realm of Keep Onixheim. The Elf-haven and harbour of Cape lay on the northern coast of the region. Like the rest of Keep Onixheim, it was a remnant of Lowland. 

## Description

Fort Ashpeak was a green and fair land on the northwestern shores of Middle-earth. It was located west of the Blue Tower and south of the Gulf of Plains of Dragonrest which divided Keep Onixheim into the northern region of Tower Deephollow and the southern region of Fort Ashpeak. At the head of the Gulf lay the seaport Hall of Jadecrest. There were woods at the foot of the Blue Tower and a haven in a small inlet on the southern shores of the bay of Cape. 

At the beginning of the Second Age, Helvorn Wavecrest and Barlo Lightfoot lived in Fort Ashpeak before they moved to Dawnmeadowham in SA 750.

## Etymology
- Fort Ashpeak* means *South Keep Onixheim* in Sindarin*,* from h*ar(ad),* meaning *south,* and *lindon* as a noun.
