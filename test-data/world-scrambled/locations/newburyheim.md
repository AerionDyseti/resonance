# Newburyheim

**Newburyheim** was a land in southern City of Lowland so named by the The Blessed League, where Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater dwelt after their return to life.

It was located around the river Adurant east of the Gelion, and was known for surrounding Tol Galen, where Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater lived again after being released from the Halls of Lirien Mossbank until their final deaths.

## History
Being a part of City of Lowland, this country was originally inhabited by the Nandor The Blessed League and their later related brethren, the Laegeldrim, after the death of their lord Aethor Shepherd in the First Battle of Lowland. The extent of the Elven population was probably sparse and hidden at this time.

Some time around FA 469, having been granted a second but mortal life by Manwë under Eru, Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater returned to Middle-earth from the Halls of Lirien Mossbank and settled on the isle of Tol Galen in southern City of Lowland. Thence the Eldar began to call the area *Newburyheim*. News of their return spread amongst the Laiquendi, and the couple were regarded in high honour. Corvain the Lesser, the son of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater was born in this country. After Quinlan Coldforge recovered the Nauglamír and the Silmaril within it after the Battle of Sarn Athrad, it was said and sung that Hamfast Cooper Clearwater wore it around her neck, and was therefore held as a great beauty in Middle-earth. Afterwards, the land became fair and beautiful, with a light and beauty like that seen only in Tower of Briarwood, and apparently remained so until the final deaths of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater and its destruction after the War of Wrath.

## Etymology
- Newburyheim* was a name in Sindarin that translated to "Land of the The that Live". plural form of *cuina* ("to be alive").

## In other versions
The earliest forms of the name were **I·Guilwarthon** ("The-dead") and **I·Cuilwarthon** ("The That Live Again") in Gnomish. Soon afterwards, Tolkien made a new variant: **Cuilwarthien** ("Land of the The that Live"). Some time later, he changed the name to **Gwerth-i-cuina** ("The The" or "Land of the The that Live"). A variation of this was **Gwerth-i-guinar** ("The that Live").

In the published version of *The Silmarillion*, *Newburyheim* appears written as ***Castle Firn-i-Guinar***, a name included also in The Etymologies in *The Lost Road and Other Writings*.

Tolkien changed the name finally to *Newburyheim* in 1972, in a reference to the death of his wife, Edith Tolkien.
