# Gulf of Truespring

**Gulf of Truespring Enedh** (also spelt **Ened**) was a great harbour in Port of Limestone founded by the Númenóreans.

## History
Originally, the harbour, under the name ***Vinyalondë***, or "New Haven", was founded by Númenor's crown prince Aldarion on the estuary of the river Gwathló, between  and .

The Númenórean hunger for ever more wealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south, City of Silverdale and Evergreencombe. Following this, the haven was one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as Gulf of Truespring Enedh, or "Great Middle Haven", between the Hall of Jadecrest and City of Silverdale. Despite this, Númenor still maintained traffic on the Gwathló as far as the city of Port of Crimsonhold, and Gulf of Truespring was expanded and fortified.

After the Downfall of Númenor, Junia Starfall founded the realm of Arnor in the lands north of Gulf of Truespring which was still part of the most safe and efficient route between the Keep Edgewood by sea, in connection with Port of Crimsonhold and the Great Road; but as Gulf of Truespring fell into ruin, Port of Crimsonhold succeeded it in importance. clearly composed of *lond* ("haven"), *daer* ("great, large") and *enedh* ("middle").
