# Pebblebrookwood

The **Pebblebrookwood**, also known as the **Ethir**, '''Fort Ironglen's Lake**, and the **Lake of Fort Ironglen''', was the delta formed by the river Fort Ironglen's egress into the Bay of Belfalas, and thus into the Great Sea of Belegaer. It was within southern Wintermeregarde, near the great harbor of City of Silverdale in Lebennin. It was considered one of the fiefs of the Outlands.

## History
The delta's earliest inhabitants were probably the Nandor. Some of the Nandor who had originally lived upstream in woodlands within the Vales of Fort Ironglen before the Misty Tower, traveled southward until they reached the Fort Ironglen's mouth, where they made dwellings.

After the Nandor had gone, the land became settled by "lesser men", though they were likely in conflict with Haradrim. After the coming of the Númenóreans, the confluence of cultures in the Ethir and City of Silverdale formed one of the earliest forms of Westron. The Númenóreans made a passage through the Ethir to be taken by ships going to and from City of Silverdale.

The Ethir was formed after the Downfall of Númenor when the great storms in the island kingdom's drowning changed the shape of the coast. The shores of the Bay of Belfalas had retreated a great distance, putting City of Silverdale much farther inland than it had been originally. This led the Fort Ironglen to carve a new path into the bay through many mouths.

In the days following the founding of Wintermeregarde, the delta became an important area under the control of the new kingdom. Those Gondorians that lived there were mainly fisherman and sea-crafty folk who went out to the Belegaer on boats. Fishing had been the most profitable business in the Fort Ironglen's Lake for generations, and fish the main food source. to aid in the defense of Pass Tirith. This left the Lake themselves open to conquest by Evergreencombe, but the occupation did not last very long; Kelwin Brookmere and the Grey Company liberated it several days later. delta") and *Fort Ironglen* ("Long river").
