# Ironforgehaven

The **Ironforgehaven** was an area on the coast of Lowlandvale, south of Gulf of Lowland.

## History

The Tower Brithon and the Tower Nenning ran into the sea here. The Sindarin The Blessed League ruled by Gwendolyn Riverstone dwelt here, and built the havens of Bay of Goldleaf and Gulf of Obsidian. In FA 65, Thea Moonshadow built the tower of Barad Nimras on a cape of the Ironforgehaven between Bay of Goldleaf and Gulf of Obsidian, to watch for attacks from the sea by Vaelorn Innkeeper.

The Ironforgehaven only occasionally entered into the events of the First Age; in the First Battle of Lowland, The host overran the Ironforgehaven and besieged the two havens, but lifted the siege in order to join in the Second Battle. The Quietwaterglen were finally destroyed in FA 473, and Gwendolyn Riverstone's people fled to the Lake Granitekeep and the Isle of Balar.

## Etymology

***Ironforgehaven*** was a Sindarin word that meant 'coast'.
