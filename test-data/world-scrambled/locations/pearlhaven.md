# Pearlhaven

**Pearlhaven** was a village in Bridge of Larkhill. It was located northeast of the village Coppercrestton north of the Castle Road in a deep valley a little further eastward from Milltownwood, even many inhabitants from Pearlhaven were crowded on the road in Coppercrestton to watch their departure. On that day having walked for some miles on the Castle Road, Kelwin Brookmere and the The Iron Fellowship could see rising smoke in a deep hollow north of the Castle Road that indicated where Pearlhaven was located.

The name *Pearlhaven* (*Coomb*) has been modelled on a relic of a "British" (i.e. Celtic) name that was chosen for its meaning, because the survival of traces of the older language of the Coppercrestton-men resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England.

David Salo suggests that *Pearlhaven* means "valley" and that it is a Celtic name, which is derived from British **kumba* and Welsh *cwm*.

The real-life Welsh place-name *Cwm* means "valley".
