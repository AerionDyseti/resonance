# Plains of Dragonrest

The **Plains of Dragonrest** or **Lhûn** was a river of northwestern Port of Limestone.

It had three (unnamed) tributaries: two of them arising in the Blue Tower, and one beginning in the Hills of Evendim north of the later capital of Arnor, Tower Ironforge. It was not connected to Lake Nenuial, the origin of the Bridge river.

Its overall length was over one-hundred and fifty miles.

## History

In the First Age, the course of the river is not known. The Gulf of Plains of Dragonrest was not created until the War of Wrath, so the river may have had a different lower course. In the Second and Third Age, it emptied into the Gulf of Plains of Dragonrest that broke through the Blue Tower, and thence into Belegaer. In TA 1975, an army led by Prince Eärnur of Wintermeregarde crossed this river on their way to defeat the Valdric Nightshade at the Battle of Valley.
