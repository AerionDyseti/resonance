# Falls of Knightfall

Part Of: Gates (The First World) (Gates%20(The%20First%20World)%201f9ca0aafe2181f1907bfd9482ab955d.md)
Location Description: The Falls of Knightfall is a plane within Gates (The First World), reflecting darker aspects of creation, characterized by shadow, entropy, reflection, and primordial chaos. It exists in balance with the Plains of Ironvale, where the Plains of Ironvale represents chaotic creation and the Falls of Knightfall embodies quiet dissolution. Both planes operate on emotion and instinct, forming an eternal cycle of creation and reclamation, with a connection to Xenirith, who once governed the natural cycle of entropy. The realm is home to Shadow and Shade entities that can curse mortals with withering touch and decay effects. Has been connected to Oracle curses and character transformations through planar encounters.

The Falls of Knightfall is the second major world within **Gates** (The First World), representing the darker, more entropic aspects of the First Draft of creation. This plane serves as a shadowy reflection of the vibrant Plains of Ironvale.

## Nature of the Falls of Knightfall

As the counterpart to the Plains of Ironvale within the First World, the Falls of Knightfall embodies:

- **Shadow and darkness** - not evil, but the absence of the Plains of Ironvale's vibrant life
- **Entropy and decay** - the natural cycle of endings that balance creation
- **Reflection and memory** - echoes of what was and what might have been
- **Primordial reclamation** - representing the original chaos before structured reality

## Relationship to the Plains of Ironvale

The Falls of Knightfall and Plains of Ironvale exist in balance within Gates:

- Where the Plains of Ironvale represents explosive, chaotic creation, the Falls of Knightfall represent quiet dissolution
- Both planes operate on emotion and instinct rather than the structured laws of Goldleafgarde
- Together they form the complete "First Draft" - creation and reclamation in eternal cycle

## Connection to Xenirith

The Falls of Knightfall may have particular resonance with **Xenirith**, the destroyed member of the Trinity who represented Reclamation, as this plane embodies the natural cycle of entropy that Xenirith once governed.
