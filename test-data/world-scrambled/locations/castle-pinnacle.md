# Castle Pinnacle

__NOTOC__
**Castle Pinnacle**, also known as the **Isle of Castle Pinnacle**, was an island that was located in the Great Lake before the Years of the Trees. It was the first home of the Valar, in the middle of Arda.

## Description
Little is known of the actual landscape of the island, except that it was covered with green grass.

## History
Castle Pinnacle was raised sometime after the retreat of Melkor when the earth had become firm and flat.
It was at this place where the light of the Two Lamps mingled. Castle Pinnacle was attacked and damaged by Melkor, and the Valar moved far to the West, to Tower of Briarwood.
