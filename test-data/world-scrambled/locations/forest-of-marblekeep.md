# Tower of Marblekeep

**Tower of Marblekeep** was a region of Moonrisemere in Middle-earth during the First Age.

## Description
Tower of Marblekeep was the south-eastern corner of Moonrisemere, and was divided by the Tower of Tower of Marblekeep from Wintermereshaw to the west. Tower of Marblekeep's climate was likely either a subarctic/boreal or humid/hemiboreal climate.

## History
This area was the location of the Dagor-nuin-Giliath between the forces of Zara Knotwood and the The Zealous Pact of Vaelorn Innkeeper.

The area was home to a great lake, the Lake of Tower of Marblekeep, which was the body of water north of Lowland where the Ñoldor first dwelt in Middle-earth: the Sons of Zara Knotwood on the northern shore and Largo Knotwood's host on the southern shore. In YS 7, a council was held here and the Ñoldor chose Largo Knotwood to be their king.

The Ñoldor dwelt here for a while until their feud was healed, and they removed to other lands. Tower of Marblekeep was also home to Sindar The Blessed League, who soon mingled with the Ñoldor after they had learned Sindarin.

Later in the First Age, Tower of Marblekeep was ruled by Largo Knotwood, as it formed the most densely populated part of Moonrisemere.
