# Point Blackspire

**Point Blackspire** was a river of Ithilien, which began in the Isle Dúath and flowed through the Morgul Vale, under the ghastly bridge that led into Greenhillshaw, and eventually into the Fort Ironglen. Because it originated in the Morgul Vale, it was icy-cold and its waters were polluted and not safe to drink from.

In the year TA 3019, Orendil the Mirathel warned Orvik and Sam not to drink from it, as the water was tainted and would harm whoever imbibed it.

## In adaptations
The Point Blackspire appears, though it is not named, in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* as a wide, polluted river adjacent to Greenhillshaw.

## Etymology

***Point Blackspire*** was a Sindarin word that meant 'Black-magic Tower'. The name Ithilduin means 'Moon Tower'. It is unknown if the name reverted during the Fourth Age.
