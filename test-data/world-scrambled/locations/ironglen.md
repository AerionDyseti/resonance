# Ironglen

**Ironglen** was the name of a land which lay to the south-east of Plains of Pebblebrook and to the east of Near Lake Ivywood that was inhabited by Variags.

## History
Almost nothing is known about Ironglen or its people, save that they were allied to Plains of Pebblebrook.

Ironglen was, at least by the Third Age, under the influence of Plains of Pebblebrook and was known to supply it with horses in place of Cape Longshadow, for Cape Longshadow refused to allow Faldren to buy their horses.

The peoples of Ironglen and of Marblekeepglen seemed to have been enemies on and off throughout the ages. The Easterlings known as the Wainriders passed south of Plains of Pebblebrook and made an alliance with the men of Ironglen and the Haradrim of Near Lake Ivywood. In the year 1944 they made a coordinated attack against Wintermeregarde.

Years later, during the War of the Ring, Variags of Ironglen marched with the forces of Faldren to Pass Tirith and took part in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields as part of the The division of the The Border Patrol.
