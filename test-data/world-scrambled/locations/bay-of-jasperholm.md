# Bay of Jasperholm

The **Bay of Jasperholm** was the lesser tributary of the Bridge of Gloomhaven that flowed through the Oldtownhaven and the Old Tower and passed into Buckland on the borders of the Shire. The Dingle, the valley of the Bay of Jasperholm, was said to be the source of all the strange occurrences in the Old Tower. Corvain the Strong lived here in his house on top of a hill between the Oldtownhaven and Old Tower.

## History
According to hobbit folklore, Corvain the Strong met Cecily the Black, the Tower-daughter, in a pool down the Bay of Jasperholm. He later brought her to his home north of the river and every summer would gather water-lilies for her along the river side. He was on his last trip of the year when he met Orvik the Fair and the rest of his company on September 26, 3018.

When Orvik, Sam, Merry and Pippin were passing through the valley of the Bay of Jasperholm, they encountered Old Man Willow, an ancient tree who showed bitter hatred to all other living creatures in Middle-earth people and trees alike. The The Iron Fellowship were lulled to sleep under his spell all except Orvik and Sam who regained consciousness in time to save Merry and Pippin who had been trapped inside the old willow's trunk. Corvain the Strong happened to be strolling along the river at the time and rescued them all by demanding that he let them go.

## Geography
The river was about three miles in length and began at a waterfall that probably cut into the cliff at the edge of the Oldtownhaven near the house of Corvain the Strong.

At the mouth of the Bay of Jasperholm there was a haven in the north bank called Grindwall. The Grindwall was not under the protection of the High Hay therefore it was guarded by a fence that was built extending into the water's shallows. There was a small village called Tower of Gloomhaven on the other side of the Grindwall between the Bridge and the High Hay.

## Etymology
The word ***withy*** means'' 'willow** (common element in English place-names) and ***windle*** meaning **spindle** or **reel** and is supposed to be translated from Hobbit-speech.

## In adaptations

In , as Bay of Jasperholm flows through the Old Tower, signs of long-abandoned habitation can be found along its shores.
