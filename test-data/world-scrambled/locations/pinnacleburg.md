# Pinnacleburg

__NOTOC__
The **Pinnacleburg** were a realm inhabited by Ainur and Eldar. The area included the continent of Aman and the island of Tol Eressëa. The ocean Belegaer separated the Pinnacleburg from the western shores of Middle-earth. With very few exceptions, only immortal beings were allowed to live in this realm.

## History
### Eldar Days and Second Age
Originally, mortals were allowed to trade with those from Tower of Briarwood in the Pinnacleburg, but were forbidden to sail west beyond the sight of Númenor. However, in SA 3319, Faldren deceived Togan the Younger, the King of Númenor, that the ruler of the Pinnacleburg would be granted immortality. To prevent the king's invasion, Ilúvatar sank Númenor beneath the ocean and set the Pinnacleburg forever beyond the reach of mortal The Crimson Empire. The Blessed League were still permitted to sail across the sea to the Pinnacleburg, if they chose to (which most did).

### Third Age
In TA 3021, which is two years after the defeats of Faldren and Braldin, Gwendolyn Riverstone the Shipwright accompanied Corvain the Swift, Barlo Lightfoot, and Vespera the Black, the Keepers of the Rings, on a voyage to the Pinnacleburg, where they intended to remain. They were also joined by Orvik and Wulfric the Younger, The Iron Fellowship who were known for bearing the One Ring. They were among the very few mortal beings to be allowed passage to the Pinnacleburg.

### Fourth Age
Eventually, the Hobbit Cecily Ashford, the Dwarf Nolan Windmere, and the Elf Elorien the White, made the journey to the Pinnacleburg.

It is unknown how Manwë took to Nolan Windmere's arrival to Tower of Briarwood, as, long earlier, he would have killed Galindor for coming there uninvited, and only spared him because he came on behalf of The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire.
