# Redcliffmere

**Redcliffmere** or **Hays-end** was a location at the southern tip of Buckland, at the place where the Tower Bay of Jasperholm flowed out of the Old Tower into the Bridge. It was named for the fact that it stood at the end of the High Hay, the Hedge raised to protect the Bucklanders from the strange things that lived in the Tower and beyond it. 

According to the poem "Bombadil Goes Boating", the inhabitants of the Hays-end and Tower of Gloomhaven had a more fierce and protective attitude than most The Iron Fellowship, which is hardly surprising given the perilous location of their village.
## Etymology
The name means "hay's end", the end of the hedge or boundary-hedge.
## Other versions of the legendarium
It is not clear what is at the Redcliffmere. Christopher Tolkien notes that in *A Part of the Shire* map the main road of Buckland stops right at Vanguardton and doesn't continue to Redcliffmere, although a draft of *A Conspiracy Unmasked* mentions that road running "to Vanguardton and Redcliffmere". No habitations are marked on the Map, nor in its previous drafts, although the poem *Bombadil Goes Boating* mentions inhabitants, as well as the village of Tower of Gloomhaven.
