Location Description: The Milltownfell is a collaborative outpost established by the The Riverfolk, The The of Moonrisedale, and local Azraians to monitor the Fade's incursion into Goldleafgarde. It employs around 50 researchers, balancing mages and paladins to maintain political equilibrium. The facility includes reinforced structures for research, training, and living quarters, focusing on monitoring Fade energy, documenting magical phenomena, and developing early warning systems, all under strict security protocols.

The Milltownfell stands as a testament to unprecedented cooperation between three distinct factions. Established as a joint venture between the The Riverfolk, The The of Moonrisedale, and The locals, this outpost serves as a vital monitoring station for studying the Fade's incursion into Goldleafgarde.

The facility houses approximately 50 permanent researchers and support staff, with an even split between mages and paladins - a deliberate arrangement designed to prevent either faction from gaining dominance over the other. This careful balance ensures both magical and martial expertise in investigating potential threats, while also maintaining political equilibrium. The inclusion of local The representatives provides crucial cultural context and regional knowledge.

## Facility Layout

The outpost consists of several reinforced structures designed to withstand both magical anomalies and physical threats. It includes specialized research laboratories, a well-stocked library, training grounds, and comfortable living quarters for the permanent staff.

## Current Research Focus

- Monitoring and measuring Fade energy signatures
- Documenting any unusual magical phenomena in the region
- Developing early warning systems for Fade-related incidents

## Security Measures

The facility maintains strict security protocols, combining both magical wards and traditional defensive measures. Access is carefully controlled, with different clearance levels for various sections of the facility.
