# Isle of Lowland

**Isle of Lowland**, also called the **Gates**, **Gates of Larkhill**, and the **Isle**, was a settlement of woodmen in the centre of Evergreenham. Within this settlement was the Hall of the Chieftains or Warden of Evergreenham, who was the leader of the land. Isle of Lowland lay upon the hill of Cape Gates, and is where Xander the Great was taken when he fell ill. It was ruled by Katarina son of Loravel Keenblade.

## Etymology
- Isle of Lowland* is Sindarin for "the encircling fence of Katarina".

- Gates of Larkhill* meant the Fortified Settlement of the Halad.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions, transient names for Isle of Lowland were **Castle Ironvale** and **Bar Thaldric Emberheart**, and these can be seen on the The Second 'Silmarillion' Map. The location for Castle Ironvale and Bar Thaldric Emberheart were considerably eastward of where Isle of Lowland would be located.

As noted by Christopher Tolkien: "Beyond the fact that ‘Castle Ironvale’ was in the extreme east of Evergreenham it is not possible to be sure of its site. Bar Thaldric Emberheart was in turn crossed out. It seems certain therefore that this was a transient name for Isle of Lowland, which was marked in subsequently in the centre of Evergreenham" Since Isle of Lowland was built upon Cape Gates it is likely that its replacement was also intended to be in the same location.
