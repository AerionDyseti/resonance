Location Description: A hidden grotto beneath a Bay Bridge features cool, damp air and a pool surrounded by glowing, possibly poisonous flowers. Notable elements include a shattered bell near Oriana's body, a draconic prayer cloth, and an exit passage with ancient brickwork. Evidence of shadow corruption is present, but some supplies remain unspoiled, leading to deeper chambers where an Drumlin was encountered.

## Overview

Hidden grotto beneath the Bay Bridge, reachable by rope tied to a surface tree root. The air is cool and damp. A ring of faintly glowing, likely poisonous flowers surrounds a clear pool.

## Notable Features

- Shattered bell near the body of Oriana (the Anointer)
- Draconic prayer cloth to the Great Dragon Spirits (Io), unaffected by shadow decay
- Exit passage transitions from natural stone to ancient, angled brickwork of the The United Republic
- Soot‑stained broken‑triangle sigil that, when touched, set heavy mechanisms in motion deeper within

## Hooks

- Shadow corruption evidence on supplies, but three vials of water remained unspoiled
- Path leads toward deeper ruin chambers where an Drumlin was encountered at initiative start
