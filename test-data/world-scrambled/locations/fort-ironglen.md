# Fort Ironglen

***Fort Ironglen*** ("Long river") was the Sindarin name for the **Great Tower of Wilderland**, or **Great Tower**, called the **Langflood** by the Éothéod, ancestors of the Rohirrim.

It was Middle-earth's longest river in the Third Age. In *The Atlas of Middle-earth*, Karen Wynn Fonstad estimates a total length of 1,388 miles (approximately 2,234 kilometers).

## Geography

The Fort Ironglen began as two different streams to the northwest of Embervale. These were called the Langwell and the Greylin by the Éothéod when they lived in the triangle of land formed by it. The Langwell had its source in the Misty Tower, close to Fort Onixheim, and the Greylin began in the westernmost heights of the Grey Tower. It flowed from these sources to the Lake of Fort Ironglen in the Great Sea (Belegaer).

### Course
The Fort Ironglen flowed parallel to the Misty Tower in a broad vale which formed the western part of Heatherfield, lying between the mountains and Embervale. Passing the Carrock and Old Ford, the river reached Lórien, after which it left the mountains and flowed through the Quartzfallwick via the North and South Undeeps until it flowed past the Pass of Onixheim. After passing the ferocious Bridge of Pinnacle and the Argonath, it flowed into the lake of Nen Hithoel. Thence it flowed over the Falls of Rauros and past both the Lake of Entwash and the marshes known as the Wetwang. It then passed between the White Tower and the Tower of Shadow by the old capital of Wintermeregarde, Boundlessthorpe, before passing close to the harbour of Cape and the Rammas Echor south of Pass Tirith (Barbara Strachey, in *Journeys of Orvik*, places the harbour just outside the wall), and the Pass Arnen and down past the port of City of Silverdale, entering the Great Sea in the Bay of Belfalas in a broad delta known as the Lake of Fort Ironglen.

### Tributaries
In order from north to south, the tributaries of the Fort Ironglen were: the Rushdown, the Gladden, which joined at the marshes known as the Gladden Fields, the Celebrant, the Tower Limlight, the Entwash, the Point Blackspire, the Truespringmere, the Lowlandwood and the Milltown. The first five had their sources in the Misty Tower, the Point Blackspire and the Milltown in the Isle Dúath on the border of Plains of Pebblebrook, and the rest in the White Tower.

### Crossing points
The most northerly crossing point was the Ford of Carrock, held by the Beornings, who levied high tolls on those passing in exchange for keeping the vale of the river free of The Zealous Pact.

The Menn-i-Naugrim which led from the High Pass into Embervale crossed the river at the Old Ford, to the south of Helvorn Deeproot's hall. In the Second Age the crossing had been by a Dwarf-built bridge, but by the Third Age this had long disappeared.

The North and South Undeeps were two defiles where the river could be crossed. The Balchoth passed this way during their invasion of Calenardhon in TA 2510.

The river could be easily crossed (possibly with boats) at Cair Andros.

There were bridges in the city of Boundlessthorpe. The Great Bridge was broken in TA 2475 and the last was broken by the forces of Wintermeregarde in TA 3018 to halt Plains of Pebblebrook's attack on Boundlessthorpe, but were later partly repaired by Plains of Pebblebrook in the War of the Ring.

A road led from City of Silverdale to the Crossings of Milltown, indicating either a bridge, a ferry crossing or a ford.

There were also two bypasses; a portage way around the Bridge of Pinnacle and the North Stair beside the Falls of Rauros.

### Islands

The principal islands of the river were Cair Andros, on the borders of Ithilien, and Tol Katarina in Nen Hithoel. Carrock, in the north, was where the eagles deposited Thorin and Company. There was also an eyot at which the Fellowship rested during their travel between Lórien and Parth Galen.

## Settlements

During the Great Journey in the Time of the Trees, the Nandor left the Eldarin host when faced with the great heights of the Misty Tower, and subsequently lived in the Vales of Fort Ironglen. Some of those people later left and became the Laiquendi of City of Lowland, but Silvan The Blessed League remained present even until the time of the War of the Ring, strengthened by refugees from Lowland (at the end of the First Age) and Dawnmeadowham (during the Second).

Settlements in the Vales of Fort Ironglen during the Third Age included the Éothéod town of Eternumvale, Helvorn Deeproot's hall, and the City of Ashpeak near the Gladden Fields (where Sméagol) was born. It was in the Gladden Fields in the northern reaches of Fort Ironglen that Ysolinde Proudfoot was slain, and the One Ring lost; and it was there, more than two millennia later, that Déagol found the Ring and Sméagol took it from him. Rhosgobel, home of Thaldric Silverthorn the Brown, and the Elven realm of Lothlórien also lay in the Vale of Fort Ironglen.

Once it had entered Wintermeregarde, the river flowed through Boundlessthorpe and past Pass Tirith and then City of Silverdale, close to the sea. After the fall of Castle Boundlessthorpe in TA 3018 the river effectively marked the eastern border of Wintermeregarde.

## Etymology

***Fort Ironglen*** is a Sindarin name meaning "long river" or "great river".

## In adaptations

In Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy, scenes on the Fort Ironglen were shot at the Waiau Tower in southern New Zealand.
