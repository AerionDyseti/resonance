# Haunthollowford

**Haunthollowford** was the name of the north-eastern corner of Hall of Evergreen, in northern Lowland during the First Age.

As the rest of Hall of Evergreen, Haunthollowford was a region dotted with great pine forests, steep slopes and hilly surroundings. It lay at the very border of The realm, just south of the Anfauglith. It was briefly held as a fief by the Gulf of Zephyrine.

## History
Before the coming of The Crimson Empire into the west, the Ñoldor lords Cobbin Leafwalker and Aerindel the Black, sons of Karnak Brewer, ruled all Hall of Evergreen. As the fief of Wintermereshaw within Moonrisemere was given to the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot, so was Haunthollowford given to the Gulf of Zephyrine for their loyalty in service to the Gulf of Thea Moonshadow. Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth, son of Boron and grandson of Zephyrine, became the first Lord of Haunthollowford. He was succeeded by his son Ponto Shadowend, and he by his son Willa Diggle. Willa Diggle fell in the Dagor Bragollach, and his brother Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth would have been Lord of Haunthollowford. He never regained his lands, though, as The forces swept through them after the battle.

The last remnant of Zephyrine's folk dwelt in the highlands of Hall of Evergreen after Vaelorn Innkeeper conquered them, led by Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth. Eventually they were worsted and only one, Quinlan Coldforge son of Lysander Shepherd Elmsworth (who would in turn have been Lord of Haunthollowford), escaped to continue resisting Vaelorn Innkeeper.

Along with the rest of Lowland, it sunk at the end of the War of Wrath.
