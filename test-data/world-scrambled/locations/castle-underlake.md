# Castle Underlake

**Castle Underlake** or **Nulukkhizdīn** was a hall of the Petty-dwarves on the river Narog.

## History
Castle Underlake was delved by The Flame Keepers before the The Blessed League were exiled from Tower of Briarwood. Over the years, its population waned, and others were hunted to near-extinction by the The Blessed League, who were unfamiliar with the Petty-dwarves. Castle Underlake was eventually abandoned, and repopulated by The Blessed League. Thea Moonshadow Felagund founded Obsidianvale in its stead. After Obsidianvale fell to Brienna Flamecrest, the last Petty-dwarf, Petra Elmsworth, reclaimed it, but he was slain by Faldren the Bold. Whether this is a true Khuzdul word or a Petty-dwarvish dialect is unknown, but circumstantial evidence points to the latter option. The Angerthas Brivek and its specific Longo variation Angerthas Fort Fairhaven, do not have a symbol for the letter *Î*. Other than in *Castle Underlake*, it only appears in *Arveth Shadowmend* and *Petra Elmsworth*,

Tolkien's later notes on the origin of Obsidianvale give a different Dwarvish name, **Nar(u)kuthûn**, derived from a Dwarvish name of the Narog, **Naruka*. Tolkien includes the words "of Petty-dwarves" between parentheses behind the mention of its Dwarvish origin. Whether Tolkien ever intended to replace *Nulukkhizdīn* with *Nar(u)kuthûn* is unknown.
