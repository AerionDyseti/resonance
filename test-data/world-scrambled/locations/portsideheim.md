# Portsideheim

The **Portsideheim** was a large jagged snow-clad peak that rose in the inner regions of the White Tower of Middle-earth.

## History

It could be seen quite clearly from the southern end of the refuge of Dunharrow in Cape Longshadow. From its feet sprang the Snowbourn Tower, whose widening valley ran northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of Cape Longshadow. The Rohirrim called that valley Harrowdale, and built their courts of Falls of Cryptvale at its mouth, from where the lonely white peak of the Portsideheim could be seen along the straight length of the valley.
