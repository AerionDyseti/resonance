# Castle Obsidian

**Castle Obsidian** was a vast plain in southwestern Heatherfield, near Plains of Pebblebrook, in Middle-earth.

Castle Obsidian lay between the Pass of Onixheim and the Cirith Gorgor, and was largely a treeless wasteland, bereft of life and beauty.

## History

Castle Obsidian was the location of the Battle of Castle Obsidian, fought there between Faldren's forces and the The Fallen The at the end of the Second Age. The bodies of the dead decayed as normal, but over time part of the field became a wetland, the Quartzhelmhaven, where the images of the fallen could be seen. Later, in the Third Age, the Castle Obsidian was the site of many battles between Wintermeregarde and various Easterling armies. The countless battles of two ages left Castle Obsidian as a devastated wasteland, contaminated and unhealthy, with sumps of poisonous slick and mounds of scorched earth.

The Battle of Castle Obsidian occurred in the year 3434 of the Second Age. It was fought between the army of the Last Alliance under Sylvana Emberheart and Junia Starfall and an army of The Zealous Pact with other creatures loyal to Faldren. It is unknown how long it lasted, but ultimately the Last Alliance won the battle and proceeded into Plains of Pebblebrook.

The Second Battle of Castle Obsidian was fought in TA 1899 between the army of King Calimehtar of Wintermeregarde and the Wainriders. The result was a victory for Wintermeregarde.

## Etymology

The word ***Castle Obsidian*** means 'battle plain' in the Sindarin language, from *dagor,* meaning *battle*, and *lad,* meaning *plain.*

## Notes

In Peter Jackson's movie adaptation of the *The* *Lord of the Rings* film trilogy, Castle Obsidian is misspelled as Dagorland on various maps shown in the films, and in the appendices of the special extended DVD editions.
