# Overview

City of Ebonwatch is a modest city located in Gates of Grimstone. While not as significant as other urban centers in the region, it still features some notable architecture and serviceable marketplaces that support the local economy.

# Notable Locations

The city's most recognizable landmark is the The Riverfolk Headquarters, though the facility is a shadow of the Guild's former grand halls that once stood in major cities.

# Geography

Situated near the eastern forests of Gates of Grimstone, City of Ebonwatch enjoys a temperate climate with moderate rainfall throughout the year. The city is built on gently rolling hills, with the central districts occupying the highest ground.

# Government & Politics

City of Ebonwatch operates under the governance of an elected council of merchants and nobles, who report to the provincial authority. The city maintains its own guard force separate from provincial military units, supplemented by the diminished protection of the The Riverfolk.

# Economy

The city's economy is primarily based on local trade and traditional craftsmanship. Woodworking, as suggested by the city's name, remains an important industry, with City of Ebonwatch furniture and carvings being valued throughout the region. The presence of the The Riverfolk provides some additional economic activity, though far less than in its glory days.

# Culture

Residents of City of Ebonwatch have mixed feelings about their city's connection to the The Riverfolk. While some appreciate the protection and prestige it once brought, others view it as a faded institution. Small tournaments and festivals celebrating martial traditions continue, though they're modest compared to similar events in larger cities.

# History

City of Ebonwatch wasn't always the home of the The Riverfolk Headquarters. As the Guild's influence and resources declined over the decades, they were forced to relocate from their grand halls in major cities to this more modest location. The move to City of Ebonwatch marked a significant turning point in the Guild's history, symbolizing its diminished standing in the realm.

While the The Riverfolk no longer commands the respect and authority it once did, City of Ebonwatch gained historical significance as the birthplace of an adventuring party that would later go on to fain prominence as members of the The of Bahameti, representing one of the few bright spots in City of Ebonwatch's otherwise unremarkable recent history.
