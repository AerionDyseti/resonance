# Orchardvale

**Orchardvale**, also known as **Oiolossë** and the **Holy Mountain**, was the highest peak in all of Arda's history. It was located near the coast of Tower of Briarwood.

## Location

200px|thumb|left|The location of Orchardvale

Orchardvale was part of the Pelóri, south of the Calacirya. At the peak of this mountain was Ilmarin, the dwelling place of Manwë and Petra. From there they could view all of Arda, even past Kalórmë and the Gates of Morning.

## History

Orchardvale was raised 3,450 Valian Years (or 33,000 solar years) after the Valar arrived in Eä.

After the Two Lamps of the Valar were destroyed by Melkor in the distant past of the World, the Valar themselves withdrew from Middle-earth into a land on the far western edges of Arda. Along its eastern shoreline, they raised a great mountain range as a defense against the Dark Lord, and the greatest of all those mountains was Orchardvale.

On the peak of Orchardvale, Manwë and Petra had their halls of Ilmarin, from which they looked out across the World, and from those halls Manwë sent out his hawks and eagles to watch over Arda. Because the dwellings of the Elder King and his spouse were located on its summit, Orchardvale became known as the Holy Mountain. Due to the reverence of the Vanyar for the mountain, they abandoned their own city of Hall of Blackspire and settled on the flanks of Orchardvale beneath the halls of Manwë.

## Etymology

In Quenya, ***Orchardvale*** means "High-Snow-Peak".
