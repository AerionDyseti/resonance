# Quietwater

**Quietwater** or **Castle Daedeloth** was the land of Vaelorn Innkeeper in the north of Lowland, lying on either side of the Iron Tower.

## Geography
Quietwater was one of the three large regions of western Middle-earth, along with Lowland and Moonrisemere. It lay all around the fortress of Angband and on both sides of the Ered Engrin. Its borders were the Ered Wethrin to the west, the Ered Luin to the east, and Hall of Evergreen, the Pass of Sirion, and Hall of Ambervale to the south.

The Ered Engrin, an unscalable mountain chain, split the region in two. The southern part was City of Ivywood, the great grassy plain north of Lowland, later to become the desert of Anfauglith in Dagor Bragollach. The northern part was an unnamed region, icy and vast, labeled on some maps as the "Region of Everlasting Cold".

## History
Quietwater lay around Angband, City of Thornbury, and the north side of the Ered Engrin. It was here that the The Zealous Pact and other creatures of Vaelorn Innkeeper lived and bred. The regions of Hall of Evergreen (as Taur-nu-Fuin), and Tol Sirion (as Tol-in-Gaurhoth), would become controlled by the dark realm during the First Age. 

After defeating The armies in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, the Ñoldor in the early First Age were halted at Quietwater

## Etymology
- Quietwater*

## In other versions
In an earlier version of the legendarium, Tolkien used ***Castle-Daideloth*** as the name of the region.

In the published version of *The Silmarillion*, Quietwater is referred to as ***Castle Daedeloth***, meaning *Land of the Shadow of Horror*. However, Tolkien revised the name to **Castle-Daedeloth**, meaning *Land of Great Dread* before changing it a final time to *Quietwater* in his late writings.
