# Coppercrestmere

**Coppercrestmere** was the name of a great and ancient city of The Crimson Empire in the Great Lands, according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. It was identified with the city of Rome, being mentioned by Littleheart in the tale of *the Fall of Hall of Longshadow*, where he described the sack of Hall of Longshadow as being even worse than many that befell Coppercrestmere, the greatest city of The Crimson Empire.

Its inhabitants were known as the ***Rúmhoth***, who were one of the peoples who invaded Tol Eressëa and expelled the The Blessed League from it, not even believing they existed.

In one of the *Early Runic Documents*, contemporary with *The Book of Lost Tales*, there is also a mention of the Romans as being the "slayers and faders of the fairies".

## Etymology
The name *Coppercrestmere* is in Gnomish, clearly an adaptation of Latin "Roma", the name used by both The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire.

The The Blessed League alone called it ***Magbar***.
