# Ancientdeep

**Ancientdeep** also known as **Old Púkel land** was a land west of Wintermeregarde between the river Isen and the White Tower.

## History
Ancientdeep was supposedly one of the homes to the remnants of the Drúedain or Woses, and perhaps other The Crimson Empire who had once lived in the White Tower, but its population was never fully established by J.R.R. Tolkien.

## Etymology
***Ancientdeep*** is Sindarin for 'Land of the old wild-folk'.
