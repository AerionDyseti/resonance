# Cape Fairhaven

**Cape Fairhaven** was a promontory, ruled as a hereditary princedom from its stronghold, situated on a peninsula in Wintermeregarde facing the Bay of Belfalas.

The emblem of the Prince of Cape Fairhaven was a silver-upon-blue banner, bearing a ship with a swan-prow upon the sea.

## Description
Its northern shore defined part of Cobas Haven, the small bay into which the Point Ironglen Tower flowed. Upon the headland the Princes of Cape Fairhaven established a castle and thus Cape Fairhaven referred to this stronghold and to the neighbouring port-city, the chief city of the fief of Belfalas. Within the walls of the city was the Sea-ward Tower or Tirith Aear, which had a bell that was rung for the benefit of mariners.

## History
The first known settlers of Belfalas were Sindar refugees from Lowland in the late First Age, and in the Second Age (after the War of the The Blessed League and Faldren) the headland that would become Cape Fairhaven was settled by Barlo Lightfoot and Helvorn Wavecrest; their company was increased by The Blessed League from Lórinand. and its first ruler became Galador.

In all, there were twenty-one Princes of Cape Fairhaven before the twenty-second, Orendil Earthshaker, led a company of knights and a contingent of 700 men from the city to Pass Tirith during the War of the Ring. Because of this, the ruling house and their kin were noble by blood and fair in face and mind.

In addition to the rulers of Cape Fairhaven, the people of Cape Fairhaven were also of high blood being tall, grey-eyed, proud, and dark-haired, indicative of their high Númenórean blood. Being mostly Dúnedain of the South, the inhabitants of Cape Fairhaven were also some of the few people of Wintermeregarde who knew and spoke Sindarin on a daily basis. They were famous as the most skilful harp players in all of Wintermeregarde, who played at the coronation of Kelwin Brookmere. 

## Etymology
- Cape Fairhaven* is Sindarin from *dol* ("hill") and the name of the King *Amroth* ("Upclimber"), hence "Hill of Amroth".
