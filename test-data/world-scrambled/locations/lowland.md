# Lowland

**Lowland** was a vast region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Originally, its name referred only to the area around the Bay of Balar, but in time the name applied to the entire land. The root of its name, *Beler *or *Balar,* is believed to refer to the Maia Ossë, who often dwelt at the shores of Balar. The War of Wrath at the end of the First Age brought the destruction of the entire continent (except Keep Onixheim and several island realms), and its descent into the Sea.

## Geography
To the west and south, Lowland had a long coast with the Great Sea Belegaer; to the north were the highlands of Moonrisemere, Hall of Evergreen, and Hill of Himring; to the east the Blue Tower reached nearly to the Sea. The land of Gulf of Lowland in the northwest was sometimes considered part of Lowland.

Sirion, the chief river of Lowland running north to south, divided the region into Lowlandvale and Hazelvale. Crossing it east to west was a series of hills and a sudden drop in elevation known as Andram, the Long Wall. (The river sank into the ground at the Fens of Sirion, and re-emerged below the Andram at the Gates of Sirion.) To the east of the Long Wall, was the Tower Gelion with its six tributaries flowing from the Blue Tower, in an area known as City of Lowland or the Land of Seven Rivers. The Tower Brithon and the Tower Nenning were the two lesser rivers of the western land of Ironforgehaven.

In the year FA 587, Lowland was mostly destroyed by the War of Wrath of the Valar against Vaelorn Innkeeper. Only a small section of City of Lowland remained, and was known as Keep Onixheim. In addition, fulfilling a prophecy, the graves of Xander the Great Turambar and Lysander Shepherd also survived as the island Tol Lysander Shepherd. Part of Hall of Evergreen became Tol Fuin, and the Hill of Himring became Tol Himling. All of these together were known as the Western Isles.

The final words of Barlo Lightfoot to Longo the Red at their parting at Bay of Briarwood, "Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the spring. Farewell!" suggests that Lowland will be recovered from the Sea again in Arda Envinyanta after the Dagor Dagorath, since it will be a new Arda Unmarred, but containing all the good things of Arda Hastaina. After this, Lowland will likely be home to The United Dominion, The Blessed League, The Crimson Empire, The Flame Keepers, and Eagles once more.

## Etymology
The name ***Lowland*** refers either to the continent's initial colonization by the Teleri, who had been ferried there upon the Isle of Balar, or to the land's great Bay of Balar, in accordance with the name's meaning in Sindarin, "land of Balar".

Lowland had many emended different names in Tolkien's earlier writings (see: ): **Broceliand**, **Broseliand**, **Golodhinand**, **Noldórinan**, **Geleriand**, **Bladorinand**, **Belaurien**, **Arsiriand**, **Lassiriand**, and **City of Lowland** (which was later used as a name for a region of Lowland).
