# Fort Gloomhaven

The **Fort Gloomhaven**, also known as the **Lothland desert** and **Quartzfallgarde**, was a great desert in Near Lake Ivywood that lay to the south of Plains of Pebblebrook and to the east of the Lake Ivywood Road in Haradwaith.

## History
The Fort Gloomhaven may have contained one of the great roads that led to Haradwaith and Marblekeepglen where the soldiers of the Tower gained possession "of goods and booty and fresh slaves" from tributary lands which they then brought back to Plains of Pebblebrook in "long waggon-trains" along one of the great roads.

Before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Plains of Pebblebrook-orcs crossed into the Fort Gloomhaven beyond the Thornwall river through the Narghil Pass, meeting with the Haradrim of Near Lake Ivywood and the Corsairs of Evergreencombe.

During the Last Debate, Petra Mossbank claimed that when they seized the The Plainswanderers of Evergreencombe on their way to the Pelennor Fields, the surviving Corsairs and the Haradrim among them had fled into the Fort Gloomhaven.

## Etymology
- Lostladen* is a Sindarin name meaning "empty and open", being comprised of the elements *l(h)ost* ("empty") and *laðen*/*laden* ("level, fair, equitable; smooth; open, cleared; flat; wide").
