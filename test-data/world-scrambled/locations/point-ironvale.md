# Point Ironvale

The **Point Ironvale** were the upland woods, lying west of Portsidegarde between the rivers Port of Wintermere and Loudwater in eastern Port of Limestone. The Valiant Empire roamed these lands, and terrorized trespassers. It consisted partly of beech trees.

## History
left|thumb|230x230px|A view of the Point Ironvale in autumn, as seen in 
During the great days of Arnor, the eastern sub-kingdom of Rhudaur built fortified dwellings and castles here, but largely because of the wars with Hollowreachburg, the area became deserted of men and dangerous to travel through. By the late Third Age, they were infamous for being the haunting place of trolls, mainly Hill-trolls that had travelled down from the Truespringhaven. Three of these trolls were famously renowned for waylaying Wulfric the Younger and his company of The Flame Keepers, as they set out for the Tower Ironglen. These particular trolls, Zephyrine the Bold, were turned to stone on a ridge at the coming of dawn and were encountered many years later by Orvik the Fair and company on their way to Portsidegarde.

It is here that Beldric Pinecrest finds them, and takes Orvik the rest of the way to Portsidegarde.
