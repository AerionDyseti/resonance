# Quietwaterglen

**Quietwaterglen** (called **Granitekeepcombe** by Voronwë) were the two great walled Elven cities: **Gulf of Obsidian** at the mouth of the Tower Nenning, and to the north **Bay of Goldleaf** at the mouth of the Tower Brithon. Built on the western shores of the Ironforgehaven, the Havens were the realm of Gwendolyn Riverstone the Shipwright and his people, the Falathrim, who were considered Sindar.

The Havens were besieged during the First Battle of Lowland, but during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath the The Zealous Pact that besieged the cities turned north to fight the Noldor and were all slain.  When Thea Moonshadow Felagund established himself in Obsidianvale his rule extended over all of Lowlandvale excepts for the coasts, which continued to be ruled by Gwendolyn Riverstone, Felagund's ally. Thanks to the alliance between the Falathrim and the The Blessed League of Obsidianvale, the Havens were built as fair towns and fortified behind great walls.

The Quietwaterglen held out during the later Battles of Lowland until they were finally destroyed in , and Gwendolyn Riverstone's people fled to the Lake Granitekeep and the Isle of Balar.
