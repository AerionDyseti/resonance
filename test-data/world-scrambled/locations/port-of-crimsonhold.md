# Port of Crimsonhold

**Port of Crimsonhold** was a ford and fortified town at the river Gwathló on the southern border of Port of Limestone.

## Geography
Port of Crimsonhold was located on the southern border of Port of Limestone a few miles downstream from the confluence of the river Port of Wintermere and the river Fort Highgate, which formed the river Gwathló. The lower part of the river Fort Highgate was a fenland called the Swanfleet and the natural state of the upper Gwathló near Port of Crimsonhold was a slow, wide river that spread into a fenland. Ships with a smaller draught could be sailed or rowed up the Gwathló as far as Port of Crimsonhold.

The land around Port of Crimsonhold was later drained, and dykes were built to construct a great port for seagoing ships, a bridge,

After he took the sceptre in , the King of Númenor, Tar-Aldarion traveled up the Tower Gwathló as far as Port of Crimsonhold and met Barlo Lightfoot there. It is not known if Port of Crimsonhold was just a ford or if somebody already settled at Port of Crimsonhold at the time of their meeting.

The Númenóreans constructed a small harbour at the river's estuary to exploit the local timber: '', 'the New Haven', which was later called Gulf of Truespring the Númenóreans had devastated the forests below Port of Crimsonhold by felling trees to obtain timber to build ships. The local population who had lived in those forests had initially been in awe of the Númenóreans, but had become hostile to them and attacked and ambushed them when the felling of trees became devastating. In return, the Númenóreans treated their attackers as enemies. It is possible that the Númenóreans built the forts at the haven of Gulf of Truespring and along the banks of the river Gwathló, because of those conflicts with the native population. The surviving native population fled from Harbor of Ebonwatch to the Misty Tower in the east, and from Highgatevale to the dark woods of the cape of Eryn Vorn. It is not known if there were Númenórean forts at the crossing of Port of Crimsonhold or whether the crossing of Port of Crimsonhold was lightly held by the Númenóreans or by forces of Faldren.

After a great fleet commanded by the Númenórean admiral Ciryatur landed with troops from Númenór in , the forces of Faldren were defeated and driven back to the south-east to the river Baranduin. After another defeat at the Sarn Ford, they were driven back further to the south-east to the river Gwathló, where the forces of Faldren were reinforced by his force at Port of Crimsonhold. However, Ciryatur had sent a part of his fleet to the haven of Gulf of Truespring and landed a strong Númenórean force there that attacked the forces of Faldren in his rear in the Battle of the Gwathló., the region of Harbor of Ebonwatch between the Gwathló and the Isen belonged to neither of those two kingdoms.

In the early days of the kingdoms of Arnor and Wintermeregarde, a seaport where seagoing ships could dock was constructed and a fort was built on great earthworks on both sides of the Gwathló at Port of Crimsonhold to protect the bridge., the North-South-Road from Wintermeregarde to Arnor already existed, but Ysolinde Proudfoot, who was in haste, chose to take the shorter route north from Boundlessthorpe up the Vales of Fort Ironglen to the High Pass over the Misty Tower to return to the Elven refuge of Portsidegarde, where he had left his wife and his youngest son..

Until the decay of Arnor, both kingdoms shared an interest in Harbor of Ebonwatch, but were mainly concerned with the maintenance of the North-South Road, the bridge at the fortified town of Port of Crimsonhold, and of the long causeways on which the road ran. Highgatevale, the region between the river Baranduin and the river Gwathló, became a part of Cardolan, one of the three successor states of Arnor. As a consequence, Port of Crimsonhold probably became a part of Cardolan.

From about , the Stoors, a tribe of hobbits, migrated to and settled in the area between Port of Crimsonhold and the borders of Port of Dreadkeep, but they left around .

After the Great Plague spread north-west from Wintermeregarde in , most of the people of Cardolan died, especially in Highgatevale. After that, Highgatevale was almost completely deserted,, but some survivors of the Plague continued to live in Port of Crimsonhold. After the decay and receding of the kingdom of Arnor, which had originally included Highgatevale, in , Harbor of Ebonwatch and Highgatevale were devastated by great floods and Port of Crimsonhold was ruined and deserted.

Over a century later in , the North-South Road no longer existed except for the crumbling remains of the causeways on both sides of the river, and the river was crossed by Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth on a ford that was formed by the ruins of the bridge.

Before 22 September , the Ringwraiths cross the Greyflood on their way to the Shire.

On 27 September  Vespera the Black crossed the Greyflood with his horse Shadowfax at Port of Crimsonhold.
Others occasionally crossed the ruined bridge - at their peril - including the Ringwraiths, servants and spies of Braldin, as well as the Rangers of the North who sought Kelwin Brookmere in Cape Longshadow in .

After the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age, the North-kingdom of Arnor was reestablished by Petra Mossbank. It is probable that the town of Port of Crimsonhold and its bridge were rebuilt. Vespera the Black announced that the Greenway would be opened again, and that there would be people and fields where there was wilderness before and that there would be room enough for people between the Isen and the Greyflood.

## Etymology
- Port of Crimsonhold* is a Sindarin name. It means "road-crossing". Its original meaning is said to have been "the Stepping Stones". Port of Crimsonhold was originally a ford over which one could walk. The name Port of Crimsonhold was already used for the ford before the town was established.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2022: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:First built by the Númenóreans as a ford and settlement, Port of Crimsonhold has been rebuilt over the many centuries of its existence. Its position upon the river Gwathló marks the boundary between the Cardolan and Swanfleet regions: thus making it a landmark in both regions. It is also the dividing point between the Greenway and the Old South Road. The ruins are currently occupied by The Zealous Pact. An expedition of hopeful settlers from Bridge of Larkhill camp nearby on the Cardolan side.
