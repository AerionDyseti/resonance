## History

Quartzfallgarde lay to the northeast of Lowland, bordered on the south by the Hall of Ambervale. Its eastern edge drew up to the Blue Tower north of Oldtown, and in the west it bordered on the highlands of Hall of Evergreen and, just north of this, the plain of City of Ivywood. During most of the First Age, Quartzfallgarde was watched over by light cavalry under the command of the Sons of Zara Knotwood, mainly Ilyndra Carpenter and Dalvorn Stoneheart. In the Wars of Lowland, The Zealous Pact, Brienna Flamecrest, and other fell beasts crossed Quartzfallgarde in order to assault Hazelvale.

Ultimately, Quartzfallgarde was drowned in the Great Western Sea at the end of the First Age as a result of the War of Wrath.
