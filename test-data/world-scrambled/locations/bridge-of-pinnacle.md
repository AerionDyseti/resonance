# Bridge of Pinnacle

The **Bridge of Pinnacle**, or simply the **Bridge**, were an impassible part of the great river Fort Ironglen.

## History
The rapids passed through the highlands of the Pass of Onixheim, above the Argonath and Falls of Rauros. As the Bridge of Pinnacle was filled with spiky rocks and stony eyots, a portage-way was built on the western bank of the river in order for travelers to avoid the rapids and go southward.

On February 23 in TA 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring encountered a number of Orc archers and a Nazgûl, whose winged steed was shot down by Elorien the White, just prior to approaching the Bridge of Pinnacle. The Fellowship afterwards used the portage-way to carry their light boats past the rapids. On February 25, Hamfast Cooper Elmsworth remarked during the passage that there are no boats that can withstand the Bridge of Pinnacle.

## Other versions
In an early draft to , J.R.R. Tolkien originally used the names **Bridge of Pensarn**, **Sarn Ruin**, and **Ruinel** for the rapids. *Sarn Gebir* originally referred to the Pass of Onixheim.

## In adaptations
### *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*
The ambush at the Bridge of Pinnacle were originally set to appear in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (2001), but on the night before filming was set to begin, torrential rains and twenty feet high floodwaters washed away the set. Due to time and budgeting constraints, the scene was then cut from the screenplay.
