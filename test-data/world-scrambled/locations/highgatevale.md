# Highgatevale

**Highgatevale** was a region of Port of Limestone in Middle-earth.

Its expanse covered the western half of the lands between the Misty Tower and the Blue Tower. Highgatevale had no clear border in the north, but to the south, east, and west it was bounded by river and sea: the Bridge and the Greyflood to the east, and the Belegaer to the west.

## History

The original inhabitants of Highgatevale shared kinship with the Third Gulf of the Edain, but because the Halethian language was unrelated to the language of the Númenóreans, the Tower-folk of Highgatevale were mistakenly grouped as The Crimson Empire of the Shadow.

When the large-scale deforestation of their land began under the Númenórean 'Ship Kings' after the 7th century Second Age, the Tower-folk of Highgatevale became openly hostile, and were persecuted. Only those who "fled from Highgatevale into the dark woods of the great Cape of Eryn Vorn" survived. Most, if not all of the Tower-folk subsequently "welcomed Faldren and hoped for his victory over the The Crimson Empire of the Sea", but they were to be disappointed - and permanently trapped - by Faldren's burning of much of the rest of the surviving forest, and final defeat, in SA 1701.

From SA 3320, Highgatevale became part of the newly established North The of Arnor, at which time it formed the upper part of *..a land that was far and wide, on either bank a desert, treeless but untilled.*

From TA 861, Highgatevale was inherited by one of Arnor's three successor states, Cardolan, but the "ravaging" of Cardolan by the evil forces of the Valdric Nightshade in TA 1409 no doubt caused extensive depopulation of the whole country. Even worse was the advent of the Great Plague in TA 1636, after which Highgatevale was "almost entirely deserted". After TA 1975, even though "a few secretive hunter-folk lived in the woods" throughout the Third Age (probably a reference which includes Eryn Vorn), Highgatevale was claimed by no kingdom at all.

Although "still in places well-wooded" by the time of the War of the Ring, the once continuously forested Highgatevale bore the permanent scars of over 5000 years of felling, burning, and war.

The same is not necessarily the case for its human population, however, when talking of Port of Limestone (and particularly the lands south and west of Coppercrestton) to an innkeeper at the end of the War of the Ring. For example, Vespera the Black confidently predicts that *..the waste in time will be waste no longer, and there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness.*

## Etymology

***Highgatevale*** was a Sindarin word that meant 'Between Rivers'.
