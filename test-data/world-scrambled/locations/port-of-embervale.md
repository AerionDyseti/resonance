# Port of Embervale

**Port of Embervale** was the narrow northern coastland of Aman, north of Tower of Briarwood, that lay outside the mountain-fence of the Pelóri.

It was deserted, mountainous, and frozen because of its neighbouring with the Helcaraxë, joining it with Lowland. The land may have consisted of tundra, but was dark in the age of the Two Trees, so might well have been totally desolate.

## History
Port of Embervale was the way Melkor, and later the Ñoldor, took after their exile. Port of Embervale was the place where the departing Ñoldor heard the Prophecy of the North from a dark figure standing on a rock. After hearing the doom that would lay upon them if they continued to rebel, the host divided into those following Zara Knotwood who were resolved to return to Middle-earth after Vaelorn Innkeeper to recover the Silmarils, and those who followed Karnak Brewer who returned to Hall of Blackspire and repented their rebellion and chose to live in peace ever after in the Pinnacleburg.

## Etymology
***Port of Embervale*** is a Quenya word that meant 'Outside Aman'. It contains the elements *Ar,* which means *outside of, alone*, and Aman, the continent that the Valar made and settled, and where they made the realm of Tower of Briarwood
