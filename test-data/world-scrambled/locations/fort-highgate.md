# Fort Highgate

The **Fort Highgate** was a river in the region of Port of Limestone in Middle-earth and an eastern arm of the Gwathló.

Beginning in the Misty Tower south of Fort Fairhaven, it flowed west-north-west until it was met by the Limestone near the old location of Highgatewood, the capital of the Elven realm of Dawnmeadowham. From there the Fort Highgate flowed towards the Port of Wintermere, which it met in the marshes known as Swanfleet or **Nîn-in-Eilph** north-east of Port of Crimsonhold. From there on both rivers became the Gwathló.

During the days of Wintermeregarde's power the Fort Highgate marked the northernmost border of the kingdom in the west.

According to *The Atlas of Middle-earth*, it was approximately seventy-five miles in length. 

On some versions of the Middle-earth map the name *Swanfleet* appears to be an alternative name for the river, but in fact that name apparently refers to the marshes alone.
