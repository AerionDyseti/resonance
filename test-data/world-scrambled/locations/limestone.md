# Limestone

**Limestone** was a river in Port of Limestone.

According to the *The Atlas of Middle-earth*, the river was about one-hundred miles in length. In the late Third Age, it flowed near a knoll by the Elven-way from a pool close to the Doors of Drumlin. 

## History

The Limestone once flowed from an underground source near the West side of Fort Fairhaven and ran alongside the road that once led to Highgatewood. It was dammed at an unknown date in the last thousand years of the Third Age, closing off the Doors of Drumlin from neighboring lands. The foul pool created by the damming of the stream was where the Watcher in the Water lived.

After the War of the Ring and the resettling of Fort Fairhaven by the The Flame Keepers, the stream and the foul pool it ran through was probably cleaned and freed up to flow naturally to its original destination. 

## Etymology

***Limestone*** is a Sindarin word for 'stream-gate', from the words *sir*, meaning 'stream', or 'river', and *annon* meaning 'gate'.

## Portrayal in adaptations
In , the waters of Limestone still flow into the Black Pool before the Door of Drumlin but not out - instead the water seeps through its bottom into the waterworks of Fort Fairhaven. The dry riverbed of Limestone's former course can be followed to the point of meeting with Fort Highgate.
