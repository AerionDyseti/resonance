# Falls of Quartzfall

Location Description: A meditative chamber within Gulf Shæbridin features stone-carved shelves with lichen, moss, and luminescent fungi arranged in spirals, centered around a still pool. The atmosphere is quiet and conducive to meditation, highlighted by a seven-pointed spiral on the floor. It has appeared in the "Heroes for Hire" campaign, where philosophical discussions about fate took place.

## Overview

A meditative chamber within Gulf Shæbridin, used for contemplation and meetings with honored guests.

## Description

A small room carved into stone, featuring stepped shelves covered with carefully cultivated lichen, moss, and luminescent fungi. The growths are arranged in spiral patterns that draw the eye inward toward a central still pool that reflects the soft bioluminescence. A seven-pointed spiral is carved into the floor, marking it as a place of temporal significance.

## Atmosphere

Quiet and contemplative. The soft glow of the fungi creates an atmosphere conducive to meditation and deep conversation. The still pool serves as both a focal point and a mirror for self-reflection.

## Campaign Appearances

### Heroes for Hire

**Session 9**: The party met Longo Shadowmend here for a philosophical discussion about fate, inevitability, and the dangers of temporal intervention.
