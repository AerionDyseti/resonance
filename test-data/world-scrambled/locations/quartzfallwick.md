# Quartzfallwick

The **Quartzfallwick** were a devastated region of Heatherfield.  They were bordered by the Pass of Onixheim in the south, Embervale in the north, and the Tower Fort Ironglen in the west.

## History

Historically, the lands were fertile plains where the Entwives gardens were located. The land was ruined by Faldren as a defense against the advance of the Allies, and the Entwives were driven away. When the Fellowship traveled by boat down the Fort Ironglen during the War of the Ring, on the eastern shore they could see nothing but barren, withered slopes without even scrub or grass. The western shore was lined with reeds, and the land was flat with some patches of grass.  Even Kelwin Brookmere could not say what had caused such desolation. The only living things they could see were birds, though there were few. The Company also saw black swans - spies of Faldren - flying overhead.
