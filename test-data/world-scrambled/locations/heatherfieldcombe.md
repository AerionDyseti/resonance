# Heatherfieldcombe

**Heatherfieldcombe** was a town in the north-eastern Buckland, to the north of Hall of Fellgard and next to the High Hay.

## Etymology
- Bury*, from the Old English *burh*, means "fortified enclosure". This, combined with Heatherfieldcombe's proximity to the High Hay, perhaps suggests that Heatherfieldcombe was built as a more recent guard against intruders from the Old Tower.

## Inspiration
There is a town named Heatherfieldcombe in Berkshire, England.

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Heatherfieldcombe is a small hamlet just past the Buckland Gate. At which Heatherfieldcombe ends and Heatherfieldcombe begins can be hard to determine.
