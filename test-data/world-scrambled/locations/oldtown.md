# Oldtown

**Oldtown** was a mountain in Bridge of Lowland (a region of Lowland) to the north of Lake Helevorn and one of the sources of the Gelion.  

The land around the mountain belonged to Orvik, who built a fortress on its western slopes. The fortress was destroyed during Dagor Bragollach. Elven forces probably withdrew from the area after the battle, and most definitely after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.
