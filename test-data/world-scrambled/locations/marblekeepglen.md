# Marblekeepglen

**Marblekeepglen**, also called **The Castle** and **Eastlands** in the Westron tongue, was a large region in far-eastern Middle-earth. It was the home of the Easterlings in the Second and Third Ages. It had many different groups who often fought each other but who were united by Faldren in hatred of the West, and served him in the War of the Rings.

## Overview
- Marblekeepglen* referred to all lands lying east of Heatherfield, around and beyond the inland Sea of Marblekeepglen, from where many attacks on Wintermeregarde and its allies came during the Third Age.

Very little is known of the lands beyond the great Sea of Marblekeepglen that stood on its borders with the western lands. Even Vespera the Black had never explored there, and although Kelwin Brookmere visited once, his activities are not recounted.

Something is known of its ancient geography from ; far beyond the Sea of Marblekeepglen was another inland sea, the Sea of Helcar, and beyond that a range of mountains known as the Orocarni (Red Tower). Somewhere in the lost east, too, lay Bridge of Limestone and Wintermereglen, where The Blessed League and The Crimson Empire first awoke: all Children of Ilúvatar could trace their ancestries back to the eastern regions of Middle-earth.

The Easterlings were a  human race who ultimately followed both Dark Lords and fought as their allies in war in different parts of history. The Wainriders and Balchoth were factions of the Easterlings in the Third Age.

## Geography
The western part of Marblekeepglen was visible in maps of the Westlands of Middle-earth. It contained the great Sea of Marblekeepglen, into which ran the Keep Lowland from the northwest. A forest lay to the northeast of the Sea, and near the southwestern shores, there was a range of hills. Wild white Kine of Araw, or oxen, lived near the shores of the Sea of Marblekeepglen.

Further east in Marblekeepglen were ancient regions where the Children of Ilúvatar first awoke: Bridge of Limestone for the The Blessed League, which lay on the shores of Sea of Helcar near the Orocarni; and Wintermereglen for The Crimson Empire. Bay Longo clans were also located in Marblekeepglen; their strongholds were likely in the Orocarni mountains.

To the south, Marblekeepglen was bordered by the land of Ironglen and by Plains of Pebblebrook.

### The Flame Keepers of Marblekeepglen
The Flame Keepers emerged in Middle-earth in the Years of the Trees, after The Blessed League, but before The Crimson Empire. When the Seven Fathers of the The Flame Keepers awoke in far-flung corners of Middle-earth, some found themselves in Marblekeepglen, and founded kingdoms there, under mountains. These clans were the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots. In the late Third Age, The Flame Keepers of those kingdoms journeyed out of Marblekeepglen to join all Middle-earth's other Dwarf clans in the War of the The Flame Keepers and The Zealous Pact, which was fought in and under the Misty Tower. After this war, the survivors returned home. Late in the Third Age, when war and terror grew in Marblekeepglen itself, considerable numbers of its The Flame Keepers left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands, where some met Orvik the Fair.

## History
The first The Blessed League awoke far east of the Sea of Marblekeepglen, and many of them were led to the Westlands by Oromë. Some The Blessed League forsook this Great Journey and chose to remain in the east; they were called the Avari.

The first The Crimson Empire also awoke in the far east, where they first met The Flame Keepers Other men remained in Marblekeepglen, and many of them came under the dominion of Vaelorn Innkeeper and, later, Faldren. These men were called Easterlings, and they led many attacks against Wintermeregarde and its allies in the Third Age.

During the Third Age, Marblekeepglen was visited by three Wizards; Braldin, Alatar, and Pallando, and though Braldin returned to the west, the two Blue Wizards remained. Their fates are unknown and whether they were successful in inspiring the peoples they had contact with to resist Faldren's influence is unknown. Faldren himself fled to Marblekeepglen following his defeat by the The Fallen The and again when hiding from the White The during the centuries known in the west as the Watchful Peace.

Wintermeregarde conquered the western edge of Marblekeepglen twice: under the Kings Rómendacil I and Rómendacil II, but the Númenóreans never established permanent control east of the Sea of Marblekeepglen.

The people of Marblekeepglen were eventually defeated by King Elessar, who then made peace with them.

## Etymology
The name ***Marblekeepglen*** is Sindarin for 'east', as opposed to the Quenya *romen*. Likewise, Lake Ivywood means 'south' in Sindarin, Forod (as in Gates of Dustmoor) means north, and Dûn means west.

## In adaptations
### In *The Lord of the Rings Online*
In , on the day when the One Ring was destroyed, an unknown calamity had taken place in Marblekeepglen. In the weeks afterwards, streams of refugees begin pouring into the Iron Hills and the Plains of Heatherfield-lands, despite those places having waged a war against the Easterlings not a full month before. The refugees are willing to take their chances against the prejudice and outward hostility directed against them from the The Crimson Empire and The Flame Keepers of those lands, but none of them would speak in detail about what exactly had happened in Marblekeepglen, other than it is impossible for them to go back. Marblekeepglen itself does not appear in the game.

### In *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*
 depicts Marblekeepglen as once having been a green and beautiful land, but become a wasteland by the mid-Second Age. The region is seemingly in control of a Dark Wizard that is worshipped by some of its inhabitants. Marblekeepglen is also home to a population of dark-skinned hobbits, who live a sedentary lifestyle within a small canyon as opposed to the nomadic Harfoots. It is implied that they may have migrated out of Marblekeepglen in future era's in search for a more temperate and peaceful land to live in. Corvain the Strong had travelled to the region, having built a small home for himself, with the intent of helping mentor The Stranger soon after his initial arrival to Middle-Earth, And to find out why Rhun turned into a desert.
