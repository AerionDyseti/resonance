# Ivywood

**Ivywood** was a haven with a ferrybridge over the river Gilrain. It was located just downstream from the juncture of the river Gilrain and the river Serni on the western side of the river in Castle-en-Ernil in southern Wintermeregarde. Through it passed the road from Erech to City of Silverdale.

On 11 Hall , Kelwin Brookmere arrived with the Grey Company and the The Golden Fellowship at Ivywood where men of Lamedon were defending the fords over the river Gilrain against men from Evergreencombe and from Lake Ivywood, which had sailed up the river. Except the stout-hearted Minto, the Lord of Lamedon, both the defenders and the attacking forces fled in terror from the The Golden Fellowship. Kelwin Brookmere asked Minto to gather his troops and to help him to pursue the men from Evergreencombe and from Lake Ivywood over the river Gilrain to City of Silverdale where the main fleet from Evergreencombe was anchored.

## Etymology
- Ivywood* is a Sindarin name, which means "fair stream". It is properly a river name for the joint course of the river Gilrain and the river Serni from their junction to the sea. Paul Strack suggests that it is a compound of *lind* ("fair") and the lenited form of *sîr* ("river").

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2014: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:As in the book, Ivywood was a city in the region of Central Wintermeregarde. It straddled the rivers Serni and Gilrain just past their confluence and therefore was built in both Castle-en-Ernil and Lower Lebennin, but was mainly considered part of the former. Three brothers, "Erchar", "Garvir", and "Herion", sons of the late "Comeldir", commanded the soldiers of Ivywood following Kelwin Brookmere's passage. The brothers were commanded to defend the city, but Erchar and Herion instead attacked the enemy forces in Castle-en-Ernil, resulting in the deaths of many of their men. The brothers were later convinced to return, and when both sides recovered from the terror of the Oathbreakers the remaining Corsairs and Haradrim launched a second attack. The Gondorians were again victorious but suffered heavy losses.
