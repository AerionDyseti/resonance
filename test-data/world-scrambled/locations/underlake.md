# Underlake

**Underlake** was a sacred mountain located at the center of the island of Númenor. Its summit was flattened and broad, and was the site of special gatherings. 

It sank along with the rest of Númenor in SA 3319, though it's summit, the Hallow of Eru, was believed to have later risen out of Belegaer as the Isle of Underlake.

## Description

Silence was required for anyone ascending Underlake. Even foreigners felt bound by this rule. The king alone was allowed to utter prayers and thanksgivings there to Thea, during the feasts of Erukyermë, Erulaitalë, and Eruhantalë.

Birds and other animals did not approach the place, only the Eagles of Manwë were seen circling over the summit and were regarded as sacred guardians of the mountain and all the land.

The base of the mountain sloped gently and divided itself into five roots reaching to the five divisions of the land. The roots were called Tarmasundar, meaning the Roots of the Pillar. On the southern slopes were located the tombs of Kings and Queens of Númenor, within a valley called Noirinan.

After the destruction of Númenor, some amongst the Exiles believed that the summit of the mountain remained as an island in Belegaer. Some Dúnedain, the descendants of the Númenóreans, are even said to have set sail trying to reach the island, from which the legend held that one could catch a glimpse of the unreachable Aman; however, Aman was no longer "in" the Earth.

==Etymology==  
***Underlake*** was Quenya for 'Heaven-pillar' or 'Pillar of the Heavens'.
