summary: A spartan chamber of stone and sunlight, devoid of ornament save for the city's seal. The air smells of parchment and ink. This is the office of The Irvek Grunthar Amun-ro, featuring polished granite desks worn smooth by time and tall windows with slightly hazed panes allowing golden rays to illuminate dancing motes in the still air. Notable features include legal scrolls and chipped clay cups.
