## Nature of the Plains of Ironvale

As part of the First World created by the **The Ancient The**, the Plains of Ironvale is a plane of:

- **Pure, chaotic life** - untamed and wild
- **The magic** - unpredictable and emotion-driven
- **Vibrant landscapes** - ever-shifting and dreamlike
- **Primordial creation** - the original blueprint before Goldleafgarde's more structured design

- Where Goldleafgarde has structure and order, the Plains of Ironvale has chaos and freedom
