# Portsidedale

The **Portsidedale** are a region of marshes and pools dotted with small islands. They flank both sides of the Haunthollowton, extending from the eastern edge of Embervale nearly to the shores of the Long Lake.

By the time of Thorin and Company’s journey in TA 2941, the marshes had expanded significantly due to floods, heavy rains, and earthquakes. This made the area even more treacherous, with the Haunthollowton breaking into numerous winding courses through the marshes. The only safe way through was by following the river itself.

The Portsidedale are described in  when Wulfric and the dwarves float down the Haunthollowton after escaping from the City of Embervale. The marshes are depicted as a vast, waterlogged expanse, adding to the challenges faced by travelers in this part of Middle-earth.
