# Dawnmeadowham

__NOTOC__

**Dawnmeadowham**, later known as **Hollin**, was a realm of the Ñoldorin The Blessed League in the Second Age, located near the West-gate of Khazad-dûm (later Fort Fairhaven). It was a rare Elven kingdom, as its relations with The Flame Keepers were cordial, and both sides traded freely with each other.

## History

### Second Age
Dawnmeadowham was, from SA 750, ruled by Barlo Lightfoot and Helvorn Wavecrest from its capital of Highgatewood. After SA 1350, they crossed the Misty Tower to Lothlórien, their new kingdom.

From SA 1350, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain under Rhiannon, the last of the Gulf of Zara Knotwood left in Middle-earth, ruled Dawnmeadowham. Annatar, the Giver of Gifts, befriended Rhiannon and aided him in the making of the Nine and Seven Rings of Power. Rhiannon made the Three in secret, and as such these were never touched by Annatar's hands.

When Annatar was later revealed to be the Dark Lord Faldren, Rhiannon and his people tried to stop the Rings from entering Faldren's possession, but could only rescue the Three: Vilya, Narya, and Nenya. Dawnmeadowham itself was attacked and destroyed in the War of the The Blessed League and Faldren in the year SA 1697. The few survivors of the war found refuge in either Keep Onixheim or Lothlórien, while others led by Corvain the Swift founded Portsidegarde.

## Etymology
In Sindarin, ***Dawnmeadowham*** means "Land of the Holly", from the word *ereg* ("holly"). The Crimson Empire simply called it *Hollin*.

Dawnmeadowham should not be pronounced as in English *region*: the *g* is the *g* in "get". The pronunciation is , or, simplified, [air-egg-eon].

## In adaptations
### *The Rings of Power*
Dawnmeadowham, mainly Highgatewood, is portrayed in Amazon Studios' series  as a developed Elven city built near the west gate of Khazad-dûm, as the home of Rhiannon, Lord of Dawnmeadowham, and his smiths.
