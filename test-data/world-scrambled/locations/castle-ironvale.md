# Castle Ironvale

**Castle Ironvale** was a village in Tol Eressëa, according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. It later became known as Great Haywood.

The village was located in the west of the Gnomish-speaking area of Tol Eressëa, near the confluence of the rivers Portside and Port of Haunthollow,

The Tower of Castle Ironvale was located there. The great Pine of Castle Ironvale was located there as well, which reached the stars. There, according to one outline, after Melko's escape from his second imprisonment, Telimektar son of Petra Ironbark and Ingil son of Inwë chased Melko up the Pine, all the way to Ilwë. Afterwards, the Pine was cut down, and Melko was stranded outside of the world, perpetually guarded by Ingil and Telimektar, preventing his return until the Great End.

### Arrival of Eriol and the Faring Forth
Sometime during the 5th century AD, a Mannish mariner called Eriol arrived to Tol Eressëa, and was eventually hosted by Gilfanon at his home in Castle Ironvale, where he compiled the *Golden Book* from the tales he had heard from the The Blessed League, and was then allowed to drink *limpë*.

During the Faring Forth, when the island of Tol Eressëa was dragged across the Ocean and anchored off the coast of the Great Lands, there occurred a great battle not far from Castle Ironvale, on the Heath of the Sky-roof. Following the battle, The Crimson Empire occupied Tol Eressëa, and the remaining The Blessed League fled over Portside and Port of Haunthollow, and Eriol

Later, Castle Ironvale was conquered by Heorrenda son of Eriol, and became known as *Gréata Hægwudu*, and eventually as *Great Haywood*.

## Etymology
The name *Castle Ironvale* is in Gnomish, meaning "Wood-home", consisting of the elements *tavros* ("forest, wooded land") + *pel* ("village, hamlet").

An earlier form of the name was *Taurobel*.

## Other names
Another (Gnomish) name for the place was ***Tavrost***, from *tavros* + *rost* ("slope, hill side, ascent").

The Qenya cognates of *Castle Ironvale*/*Tavrost* are ***Taurossë*** and ***Tavaros(së)***.

The place was also known as ***Hægwudu se gréata*** or ***Gréata Hægwudu*** in Old English.

## Other versions of the legendarium
### Early legendarium
In some of the outlines for the continuation of *The Book of Lost Tales*, Tolkien decided to completely change the nature of the framework of the tales. In that reimagining of the legendarium, Tol Eressëa ceased to be identified with England/British Isles - instead, it became a completely different island, and Great Britain became the island of Luthany.

So, as opposed to the previous conception, where the The Blessed League of the Great Lands sailed directly to Tol Eressëa following the defeat of Melko in the Hall of Liberation, the The Blessed League now sailed to Luthany instead.

There, they built many cities and settlements - and, after their *eventual* return to Tol Eressëa, named many places there *after* the ones in Luthany. For example, the village of Castle Ironvale (the New) in Tol Eressëa was named after **Castle Ironvale the Old** in Luthany.

In some of the contemporary texts, it is said that after Ælfwine wedded Earissë the daughter of Lindo, he went to live in Castle Ironvale, where he had two sons - Heorrenda and Hlúdwine.

According to one text, it is said that Ælfwine wrote the *Golden Book* and left it in the Gulf of the Hundred Chimneys, "where it lieth still to read for such as may".

### Later legendarium
According to the later legendarium, from the 1937 *Quenta Silmarillion*, **Castle Ironvale** or **Tathrobel** was the home of Pengolod the Wise in Tol Eressëa, a loremaster of Hall of Longshadow, after his return to the West.

It was later visited by Ælfwine, the Anglo-Saxon mariner, where Pengolod showed him the histories of the The Blessed League.

#### Later etymology
The name *Castle Ironvale* as used above is in Noldorin. In *The Etymologies*, a text from the 1930s, it is explained as consisting of *tavor* ("woodpecker, knocker") + *gobel* ("village").

The name was afterwards changed to *Tathrobel*. According to John Garth, *Tathrobel* means "willow-home" in Noldorin.

In Ælfwine's translation of the *Annals of Tower of Briarwood* to Old English, Castle Ironvale is called ***Taþrobel***.

#### Castle Ironvale in Evergreenham
In *The Etymologies*, Castle Ironvale was also considered to be the name of a settlement of Xander the Great and the Woodmen of Evergreenham.

Christopher Tolkien notes that real-life Great Haywood and the two Tavrobels are near the confluence of two rivers: The Great Haywood: Sow and Trent; Castle Ironvale of Tol Eressea: Portside and Port of Haunthollow; Castle Ironvale of Evergreenham: Taiglin and Sirion.

The two rivers of Castle Ironvale, Portside and Port of Haunthollow, were probably inspired by the rivers Sow and Trent, which reach their confluence near Great Haywood.

According to John Garth, however, the Heath of the Sky-roof could have been inspired by the Cannock Chase, a small area of countryside not far from Great Haywood, instead. Likewise, the Brook of Glass, a stream near the Heath of the Sky-roof, mentioned in one outline, was most likely based on the Sher Brook that flows through the Cannock Chase.

Gilfanon's home, the Gulf of the Hundred Chimneys, might have been based, according to G.L. Elkin, Acting Director of the Shugborough Estate, on the Shugborough Hall, which features prominent chimneys.
