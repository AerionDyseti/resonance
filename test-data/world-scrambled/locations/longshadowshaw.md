## History
During the Great Journey in the Years of the Trees, the Eldar reached the Sea of Marblekeepglen after marching 450 miles west or northwest from Bridge of Limestone. The Teleri managed to reach new heights in their ship-making to traverse the Sea of Marblekeepglen during this time.

During the westward migration of The Crimson Empire in the First Age, many tribes populated the shores of the Inland Sea. While the Lesser Folk arrived first and dwelt at the feet of some nearby hills, the Greater Folk that came later dwelt in Longshadowshaw before they resumed their migration to Lowland.

During the early Third Age, King Rómendacil I of Wintermeregarde drove the Easterlings back to the lands around the Sea of Marblekeepglen. His son, Turambar, expanded the kingdom to the Castle. By the time of King Hyarmendacil I, the Inland Sea was the eastern border of Wintermeregarde.

Vorondil hunted the Kine of Araw near the shores of the Sea of Marblekeepglen, though it is untold which side he did. Wintermeregarde's eastern border was apparently further east than the Inland Sea during the time of Rómendacil II. noun *neldor* ("beech-tree; beech") and *-eth* ("abstract noun").
