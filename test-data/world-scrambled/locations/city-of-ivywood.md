# City of Ivywood

**City of Ivywood**, later known as **Anfauglith** or **Castle-nu-Fauglith**, was the wide green plain that lay north of the highlands of Hall of Evergreen and south of The fortress of Angband in the Iron Tower, in the First Age. It was eventually desolated by Vaelorn Innkeeper and absorbed into his dark realm known as Quietwater; this event led to its renaming to *Angfaulith*, or "Gasping Dust".

## History

In the first days after the rising of the Sun, City of Ivywood was a green plain with rich grass, reaching from Moonrisemere and the Ered Wethrin in the west to the Blue Tower in the east, and rising into the highlands of Hall of Evergreen in the south. However, the plain was laid waste by poisonous gases and rivers of flame from City of Thornbury during the Dagor Bragollach, and it was renamed.

The battle of Nírnaeth Arnoediad was fought on the plain, and the dead piled up in a hill in the midst of it, named *Haudh-en-Ndengin*, the Hill of Slain, by the The Blessed League, and *Haudh-en-Nirnaeth*, the Hill of Tears, and grass grew again upon the hill and nowhere else in Anfauglith.

Like the other lands around it, Anfauglith sank beneath the waves after the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age.

## Etymology

***City of Ivywood*** is a Sindarin word meaning 'Green Region'. ***Anfauglith*** and ***Castle-nu-Fauglith ***are translated in the text as 'Gasping Dust' and 'Land under Choking Ash,' respectively.
