# The Waystation (Mistholmemere)

Location Description: A The waystation in the Mistholmemere, sealed for over 800 years, served as a resupply point during the Darkness Wars. It features a concealed entrance, a main chamber with supplies, barracks, and a records room. Notable contents include a The battle standard and personal effects of Valdric Grubb, a bard who never returned. Potential dangers include structural instability and ancient creatures. The location is significant for a quest option involving retrieving the battle standard as a diplomatic gift, with emotional ties to a character's past.

## Overview

A The Noble Fellowship supply waystation established during the Darkness Wars (730-738 MR), located in the rocky foothills where the Mistholmemere gives way to rougher terrain. The waystation was sealed when the The disbanded and has remained undiscovered for over 800 years.

## Location

The waystation is marked on the map recovered by the Keys to Perfection party from the ancient cistern. It sits approximately 2-3 days off the direct route between Granitekeepfell and the Oracle's temple—close enough to be reachable, but far enough to require a deliberate detour.

## Physical Description

A small complex carved into natural rock formations, designed for troops to resupply, rest, and regroup during long desert campaigns. The entrance is concealed by sand and weathering, but the The sigil (modified symbol of Sol) is still faintly visible on the door stone.

**Interior:**

- **Main chamber** — Storage area with preserved (mostly rotted) supplies
- **Small barracks** — Sleeping quarters for traveling soldiers
- **Records room** — Troop movement logs, mission orders, official correspondence
- **Personal quarters** — Private storage for officers and VIPs passing through

## Contents

### The Battle Standard

A ceremonial banner bearing the symbols of all allied nations who fought together in the Darkness Wars. The standard was meant to be presented to allied leaders as a gesture of unity—but the war ended before it could be delivered. It would serve as an exceptional diplomatic gift, representing the very alliance that made peace possible.

### Valdric's Effects

In the personal quarters, a chest bearing Sol's symbol contains the belongings of Valdric Grubb, the half-elven bard and The of Atheros (Light). He left his things here before the final assault against the Vampire Lord, planning to retrieve them on the return journey.

He never came back.

The chest contains:

- **Valdric's Journal** — Original The sigil designs, songs about the The, personal observations
- **Unfinished song: "The Shadow and the Sea"** — About an elven sorceress and her dragon
- **Secondary lute** — Not his primary instrument, but one he treasured
- **Personal keepsakes** — Items recognizable to those who knew him

### The Records

Official documents including:

- Troop movement orders
- Mission briefings
- Supply manifests
- Correspondence between The commanders

## Potential Dangers

The waystation has been sealed for 800 years. Possible hazards include:

- **Environmental** — Structural instability, trapped air, ancient preservation magic gone wrong
- **Creatures** — Bay creatures that found another way in, undead remnants
- **Awakened threats** — Given recent events, something may have *woken up* along with other ancient evils

## Story Significance

### Option D: The The Cache

If the party chooses to help Brennan keep Iri the falcon, they can follow the map to this location and recover the The battle standard as a diplomatic gift for The Crimson Fellowship to present to Bridge. This requires:

- **Time**: 2-3 days each way (~1 week detour)
- **Resources**: Either requisition more supplies or stretch rations thin
- **Risk**: Stenvald dangers within

### Emotional Payoff

The discovery of Valdric's effects creates a powerful moment for Dana (player of Dorwyn), whose previous character Lianaaniel fought alongside Valdric in the Darkness Wars campaign. The journal contains entries about Lia and her dragon Karasi—written by someone who walked into the sun rather than exist as a monster.

## Meta Information

This location exists specifically as **Option D** for resolving the falcon subplot from *The Gilded Cage* adventure. The party has four options for helping Brennan keep Iri:

- **Option A**: Royal Favor — Use Crown Princess Amara's boon
- **Option B**: The Compromise — Accept that Iri goes to Bridge (default)
- **Option C**: The Loophole — Political maneuvering (damages reputation)
- **Option D**: The The Cache — Retrieve the battle standard (costs time/resources/risk)
