# Tower of Grimstone

'''Tower of Grimstone'* was a lowland region of the The Blessed League in Middle-earth. It was located between the hills surrounding Himring, the extension of the Blue Tower just north of Oldtown, and the two arms of the Gelion river. It was the widest break in the northern mountain-fences of Lowland. The region was the ward of Ilyndra Carpenter, second of the Sons of Zara Knotwood. 

The Gap had a combination of scrub-lands, thickets, and light forest areas. It was also somewhat cold at times, being close to the northern realm of Vaelorn Innkeeper. Due to its open terrain and lack of hills, it was a natural route for attacks by The The Zealous Pact, who could then pass from the north into the lands of Zara Knotwood's people. In response, Ilyndra Carpenter kept many riders to guard the Gap, serving as the main cavalry force of the Ñoldor. In addition, Orvik fortified the mountains to the east (establishing his base upon Rerir's slopes and beside Lake Helevorn) while Dalvorn Stoneheart constructed his stronghold atop the Hill of Himring to the west.  

## History

In the early First Age, horsemen led by Ilyndra Carpenter guarded Tower of Grimstone against the forces of Vaelorn Innkeeper. During the Dagor Bragollach, they were defeated; Ilyndra Carpenter fled to Himring, along with most of the survivors of the battle. After the War of Wrath, Tower of Grimstone was destroyed and lost under the waves along with the rest of Lowland.
