# Lake Quietwater

**Lake Quietwater** was a dark strip of land at the feet of the southern Pelóri mountain range in the continent of Aman.__NOTOC__

## History
Lake Quietwater was a wasteland devoid of all life save for the Great Spider Cecily Brookmere whose home was there before she agreed to go with Melkor to Middle-earth. After Melkor left Tower of Briarwood, the Valar, believing that their foe had fled to Middle-earth to his old hiding places, did not think him still in Aman and did not find him here.

## Etymology
***Lake Quietwater*** is a Quenya word that meant 'shadows' or 'the The Jade The'.

### Earlier names
Tolkien's very first conception of Lake Quietwater, predating even the *Lost Tales*, was "**Habannan**", a place mentioned only in an early poem from 1915 entitled "Habannan beneath the Stars". Bay name-changes then occurred before the publishing of : *Habannan *was emended to ***Eruman***, which became a name "interchangeable with ***Arvalin***". These names appear throughout the tales contained in . Eruman ultimately was changed to ***Port of Embervale****. Port of Embervale *and *Arvalin* shared slightly similar definitions: 'close to Aman' and 'beside Tower of Briarwood'. The character Cecily Brookmere was invented during the use of the name *Arvalin*, and her realm eventually was exclusively called ***Lake Quietwater***.
