# Hall of Ambervale

The **Hall of Ambervale** was an Elven realm in Hazelvale between Hall of Evergreen and the Blue Tower next to Tower of Grimstone.

It consisted of a series of hills and plains.

## History

The Hall of Ambervale was fortified by Dalvorn Stoneheart after he moved his brothers and their people out of Moonrisemere further east to avoid any feuds with their kinsmen. He established himself on the hill of Himring. It withstood the frequent attacks by the forces of Angband throughout the First Age, standing strong in the Battles of Lowland including the ravages of the Dagor Bragollach. It was finally overrun during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in FA 473.
