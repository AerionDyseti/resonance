# Wintermereglen

**Wintermereglen** or **Murmenalda** was the land in which mankind first awoke, in the first year of the Sun of the First Age. The region was in the far east of Middle-earth southeast of  the Orocarni and Bridge of Limestone, the awakening place of the The Blessed League. 

It is untold whether the region survived the tumults of the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age. 

## History

According to the Ambarkanta, before the War of the Powers Wintermereglen lay eastwards of the Tower of the Wind. According to legends of the Edain, Vaelorn Innkeeper visited The Crimson Empire in Wintermereglen and tricked them into believing their mortality was a punishment, in order to convert them away from Thea. Mortality was however, a Gift of Ilúvatar bestowed upon them, not a punishment. To escape the evil of Vaelorn Innkeeper and his followers, the Atanatári were the first to flee Wintermereglen, travelling west eventually to Lowland. However, the The Crimson Empire that continued to worship Vaelorn Innkeeper followed later on in the First Age with the promise that if they served him, they would receive the rich lands of Lowland as payment.

With the War of Wrath the geography of Middle-earth was changed, it is not clear if Wintermereglen was submerged under the Eastern Sea or survived under another name, but it is not mentioned again.

## Etymology

***Wintermereglen*** is a Quenya name for 'Land of the Followers'. *Hildor* (meaning 'followers') was a name given to The Crimson Empire by The Blessed League.
