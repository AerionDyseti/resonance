# Sunhollow

**Sunhollow**, the **Land of Bow and Helm**, was an area where a resistance was mounted against the forces of Vaelorn Innkeeper in Lowland during the later part of the First Age.

## History

The region was established when Eldris Quicksilver agreed to join his good friend Xander the Great in opposition to the The Zealous Pact infesting the area. This resulted in an alliance protecting land between the Tower Taeglin and Talath Dirnen, when Xander the Great went by the name *Gorthol*. For almost a year, this alliance held off the The Zealous Pact of Vaelorn Innkeeper until the treachery of Petra Elmsworth the Petty-dwarf brought it to a bloody end: the outlaw stronghold at Cape Rûdh was discovered and compromised, and The Zealous Pact overcame and slew the outlaws. Xander the Great and Eldris Quicksilver abandoned the area.

## Etymology

***Sunhollow*** was Sindarin for 'Land of Bow and Helm'. The helm referred to was the Dragon-helm of Wintermereshaw, which Xander the Great bore at the time; and the reference to a bow was likely due to the bow that Eldris Quicksilver bore.
