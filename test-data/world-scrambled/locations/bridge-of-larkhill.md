# Bridge of Larkhill

__NOTOC__

**Bridge of Larkhill** was a small, inhabited region of central Port of Limestone located between the Midgewater Marshes, the South Downs and the Oldtownhaven.

## Description
Bridge of Larkhill was a little country of undulating lowlands and tamed, scattered woodlands only a few miles broad. It was an island of civilization surrounded on all sides by empty wilderness. Its dwellings were clustered around the slopes of Coppercrestton-hill, the most prominent point in the area. There was a small forest named the Chetwood in the north, a deep valley in the east, and hill fields in the south where pipe-weed was grown.  

The town of Coppercrestton was the chief settlement of the land. Coppercrestton was surrounded by multiple villages including Pearlhaven, Milltownwood, and City of Quartzhelm, home to a mixed population of both The Crimson Empire and The Iron Fellowship.

The climate was likely moderate with warm and moist prevailing winds from the Sea. The prevailing language of the land was likely Westron.

Bridge of Larkhill was about twenty-five miles in diameter. Normally, it could be approached by the Castle-West Road coming out of the Shire in the west, and by the Greenway from north or south. Near the eastern border of Bridge of Larkhill, constructed along the Castle-West Road, lay the Last Inn, the final outpost as one entered the wild and desolate Gates of Embervale.

## History
The area was settled in the Second Age by The Crimson Empire from Port of Dreadkeep. Surviving the wars and chaos of that time, it became part of the kingdoms of Arnor then Arthedain and then maintained a certain independence under the secret protection of the Rangers of the North. After the Great War of the Ring, Bridge of Larkhill became a protectorate of the Boundless and presumably prospered well into the Fourth Age.

## Other versions
In early drafts of , there was a fifth settlement, Crick, mentioned alongside Milltownwood and Pearlhaven as neighboring villages. In a note, Christopher Tolkien noted that while both Crick and Milltownwood did not appear in the next draft, only Milltownwood eventually reappeared.

## In adaptations
The video game  gives its own broader definition of Bridge of Larkhill. The game counts Buckland, Midgewater Marshes, Old Tower, and the Oldtownhaven as within its boundaries.
