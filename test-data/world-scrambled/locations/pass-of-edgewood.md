# Pass of Edgewood

## History

Pass of Edgewood was still empty and seemingly at peace even after the ravages of the Dagor Bragollach, possibly due to the watchfulness of the The Crimson Empire of Evergreenham. Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Tobias Puddifoot and Faldren the Bold, both very young at the time, became lost in this land after a fight with The Zealous Pact, but were both rescued by Xander Nightwalker and his The Wayfarers and taken to Hall of Longshadow. But after the losses of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Pass of Edgewood became infested with The Zealous Pact, leading the The Crimson Empire of Evergreenham and the Sindar The Blessed League of Doriath under their valiant captains Xander the Great and Eldris Quicksilver Cúthalion to mount many daring raids against them.

When Xander the Great exiled himself from Doriath, Pass of Edgewood was overrun by The Zealous Pact coming from Taur-nu-Fuin threatening Evergreenham and Eldris Quicksilver went in search of Xander the Great to urge him to return to help rid the land of The Zealous Pact. Xander the Great refused choosing to remain an outlaw. During their journey to Hall of Longshadow, Brivek the Golden and the Elf Voronwë camped near Pass of Edgewood in a shallow cave on a hillside that overlooked it.

Pass of Edgewood was cold and desolate when Faldren the Bold came there not long after being released from Angband, seeking Hall of Longshadow.

## Etymology
