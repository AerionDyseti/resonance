# Bridge of Fellgard

__NOTOC__
**Bridge of Fellgard**, once called by the The Iron Fellowship **the Faerie**, was the region of Aman where the The Blessed League lived in ancient times before the Changing of the World.

## Description
The size of Bridge of Fellgard is unknown, but the area between the Bay of Bridge of Fellgard and the Pelóri was probably at least a few dozen miles wide; Bridge of Fellgard also consisted of the shore of Orchardvale and the Calacirya where Hall of Blackspire was built. The shore probably extended hundreds of miles to the north of the Calacirya. 

The city of the Ñoldor (and for a time the Vanyar also) was Hall of Blackspire, which was built on the hill of Túna facing both the Two Trees and the starlit seas.

The city of the Teleri, on the north shore of the Bay was Alqualondë, or Haven of the Swans, whose halls and mansions were made of pearl. The harbor was entered through a natural arch of rock, and the beaches were strewn with gems given by the Ñoldor.

In the bay was Tol Eressëa the Tower Isle, which was an island at one time adrift, until Junia Stormbringer rooted it in the bay.

South of Bridge of Fellgard was Lake Quietwater, once the home of Cecily Brookmere, a vast creature in the shape of a spider.

== Etymology == 
***Bridge of Fellgard*** is a Quenya word that meant 'Elvenhome'. In Old English the 'Elvenhome' was called ***Ælfhâm***.
