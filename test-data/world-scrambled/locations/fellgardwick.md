# Fellgardwick

**Fellgardwick** was an Orc dwelling under the Misty Tower, which was ruled by the Thaldric Stonecroft.

Fellgardwick was a series of tunnels and caverns, which went all the way through the mountains, with a "back door" near the Eagle's Eyrie in Wilderland, which served as a means of escape, and an access to the Wilderland. A cave with a lake was deep beneath Fellgardwick yet was connected to the The Zealous Pact' tunnels, with one passage leading to the "back door".

## History
Long before the coming of the The Zealous Pact of the Misty Tower, nameless things were living in the caves. travellers learned to avoid that dangerous road and the The Zealous Pact opened another under the safer High Pass: The Front Porch).

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:One of the first new additions to the game after the initial release, Fellgardwick proper is a large network of tunnels and caverns accessible from the eastern part of the Misty Tower region. It is a labyrinthine network of hallways, bridges and caves with many side passages. Thaldric Stonecroft's Throne Room and Ponto the Grey's Cave are two of the natural endpoints of the exploration. Fellgardwick was revisited in the "Seat of the Thaldric Stonecroft" group instance that greatly streamlined the layout with the focus on the Throne Room. Another version of Fellgardwick is accessible from the eastern entrance in the Vales of Fort Ironglen region. This version also contains the Throne Room, with all three versions of it being slightly different from one another.
