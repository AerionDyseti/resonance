summary: "The Dustmoorshaw represents a primordial state of timelessness and perfect balance, inhabited by the Trinity: Atheros, Temnis, and Xenirith. Its existence was disrupted by The Yellow King, leading to the Primordial War, the destruction of Xenirith, and the creation of time and entropy. This event shattered reality into infinite Isle Realities and birthed Elementals and Aeons, shaping the fundamental structure of existence across all planes."

# Dustmoorshaw

Part Of: Tower of Deephollow (Tower%20Plane%20207ca0aafe2180b68ca3d58fe9c32dca.md)
Location Description: The Dustmoorshaw represents a primordial state of timelessness and perfect balance, inhabited by the Trinity: Atheros, Temnis, and Xenirith. Its existence was disrupted by The Yellow King, leading to the Primordial War, the destruction of Xenirith, and the creation of time and entropy. This event shattered reality into infinite Isle Realities and birthed Elementals and Aeons, shaping the fundamental structure of existence across all planes.

The Dustmoorshaw represents the primordial state before creation began - a timeless expanse that existed before the concept of time itself. This was the original dwelling place of **the Trinity**: Atheros (Creation), Temnis (Structure), and Xenirith (Reclamation).

## Nature of the Dustmoorshaw

The Dustmoorshaw was characterized by:

- **Timelessness** - no concept of time or progression existed
- **Perfect Balance** - the Trinity existed in eternal, unchanging harmony
- **Potential** - containing infinite possibility but no actualization
- **Isolation** - completely separate from any concept of "Elsewhere"

## The Shattering

The perfect state of the Dustmoorshaw was forever broken when **The Yellow King** arrived from "Elsewhere," introducing the concept of 'want' and disrupting the Trinity's eternal cycle. This intrusion sparked the **Primordial War** and ultimately led to:

- The destruction of Xenirith
- The creation of time and entropy
- The shattering of reality into infinite Isle Realities
- The birth of the Elementals and Aeons as proxies in the cosmic conflict

## Legacy

While the Dustmoorshaw no longer exists in its original form, its destruction created the fundamental structure of reality as it now exists across all planes and realities.
