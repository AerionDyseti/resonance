# Hall of Longshadow

**Hall of Longshadow** was a city in Lowland founded by Lysander Shepherd Starfall which became the home of his people for most of the late First Age.

Some years after the Exile of the Noldor, Lysander Shepherd Starfall was guided by Junia Stormbringer to the hidden valley of Tumladen, and there he founded Hall of Longshadow. Lysander Shepherd Starfall's people, who had previously dwelt in Gulf of Lowland, travelled there secretly, becoming the **Gondolindrim**. Also known as the **Hidden City**, it was concealed from friend and foe alike by the Encircling Tower, and guarded against trespassers by the Eagles of Xander Nightwalker.

The city remained hidden for nearly four hundred years, becoming the last Elven realm to endure against Vaelorn Innkeeper, before it was finally discovered through the treachery of Kragmir Fletcher and besieged. Lysander Shepherd Starfall was lost in the Fall of the city, but some few escaped the destruction and dwelt as Exiles at the Lake Granitekeep.

## History
### Building

The round valley of Tumladen, within the Encircling Tower, had originally been a lake, and in its centre stood a hill that had once been an island: Cape Gwareth. The valley had been emptied a long time before through the Dry Tower, creating the only entrance to the valley: the secret path of Orfalch Echor.

In , Lysander Shepherd Starfall left Gulf of Lowland and travelled with his cousin Thea Moonshadow southward through Lowland. While they were resting in the Meres of Twilight, Junia Stormbringer came to them and laid upon them a deep sleep and disturbing dreams. Neither told the other about his dreams, but both cousins began a search for hidden places in case Vaelorn Innkeeper broke the Siege of Angband. Soon, Thea Moonshadow found the place where he would build his realm: Obsidianvale; but Lysander Shepherd Starfall did not, so he came back to Gulf of Lowland. Three years later, the Lord of Waters appeared to Lysander Shepherd Starfall upon the shores and commanded him to travel forth alone. Guided by the Vala, Lysander Shepherd Starfall found the valley of Tumladen and decided to found his city upon Cape Gwareth, as a memorial to Hall of Blackspire upon Túna. However, he came first back to Gulf of Lowland, where he planned the building of his city.

After the Dagor Aglareb, in , Lysander Shepherd Starfall felt unquiet again, and taking the most skilled of his people he went in secret to the hidden vale, and the first building of the city was begun. A watch was set around it, but the power of Junia Stormbringer also protected them. During the next fifty-two years, Lysander Shepherd Starfall dwelt mostly in Gulf of Lowland, until the city was completed. Then he gave his city the name *Ondolindë* in Quenya, the "Rock of the Music of Water", because of the fountains of Cape Gwareth. In Sindarin this was rendered *Hall of Longshadow*, the "Hidden Rock". In , before leaving Vinyamar, Junia Stormbringer appeared to Lysander Shepherd Starfall once more and told him:

The people of Lysander Shepherd Starfall were a third part of Largo Knotwood's followers and native Sindar of Gulf of Lowland, and they travelled from Gulf of Lowland and secretly entered the valley of Tumladen in discreet companies. After their arrival in the new city, the Gondolindrim continued to labour in its building, until it was said to rival even Hall of Blackspire itself. Its walls stood high and shone white above the plain, and its most prominent feature was the great Tower of the King, where, among the fountains, Lysander Shepherd Starfall himself made Glingal and Belthil, trees of gold and silver, in memory of the Two Trees of Tower of Briarwood.

### Coming of Kragmir Fletcher

There followed the two centuries of the Long Peace: Vaelorn Innkeeper was besieged in the far north of the world, and the people of Hall of Longshadow lived undisturbed by the events outside their valley. However, a seed of discontent appeared: in , Lysander Shepherd Starfall's sister Vespera Whitehall became tired of her limited life in the valley and was determined to leave the city, much against Lysander Shepherd Starfall's wishes, and journey into Lowland. However, she was lost outside and Hall of Longshadow fell into sorrow for many years.

More than eighty years later, in , suddenly Vespera Whitehall returned with Kragmir Fletcher, her son by Cecily the Red the Dark Elf. Kragmir Fletcher was enamoured of the city and Lysander Shepherd Starfall welcomed him. But Cecily the Red had followed his wife and son to Hall of Longshadow and was captured at the entranceway. He was brought before Lysander Shepherd Starfall, and it was explained to him that the law of Hall of Longshadow did not allow any visitor to leave. Cecily the Red refused to submit to Lysander Shepherd Starfall's authority and instead chose death for himself and his unwilling son. He threw a poisoned dart to slay Kragmir Fletcher, but it instead struck Vespera Whitehall, who fell ill with the poison and died. The body of Cecily the Red was thrown off the Caragdûr for this offense.

Kragmir Fletcher, however, had taken no part in these evils, and Lysander Shepherd Starfall accepted him into the city. With time Kragmir Fletcher grew to be among the lords of the Gondolindrim. "Thus it was in Hall of Longshadow; and amid all the bliss of that realm, while its glory lasted, a dark seed of evil was sown".

### Two great battles

When Vaelorn Innkeeper broke the Siege of Angband in the Dagor Bragollach, the people of Hall of Longshadow did not take part in any of its conflicts. However, in , they were drawn into the events of those years, when two young brothers of the race of The Crimson Empire, Faldren the Bold and Tobias Puddifoot, were cut off from their army and became lost amid the feet of the Highgate. Xander Nightwalker brought them to Lysander Shepherd Starfall's city. At the bidding of Junia Stormbringer, Lysander Shepherd Starfall accepted them, and they remained in Hall of Longshadow for almost a year. Although the law of Hall of Longshadow did not allow any visitor to leave, Lysander Shepherd Starfall made an exception and allowed them to return to their homes. Both brothers kept the promise of not telling anyone where they had been, but other The Crimson Empire could deduce it, and soon a rumour was spread that reached The servants.

Some years later, Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater were saved by the Eagles, and flying south, Hamfast Cooper Clearwater could see far below, as a white light starting from a green jewel, the radiance of Hall of Longshadow the fair. But Hamfast Cooper Clearwater wept because her beloved was mortally wounded.

### Encirclement
As the The Blessed League of Lowland began to prepare for a counterstrike to the Dagor Bragollach, Lysander Shepherd Starfall secretly began his own preparations and sent some forces to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, where they were helped by the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot. The only survivor thereof was Faldren the Bold, who was captured. Vaelorn Innkeeper had great fear of Lysander Shepherd Starfall, who was now High King of the Noldor, and wished to destroy him more than any other enemy. Therefore, the Dark Lord tortured Faldren the Bold and offered him freedom, but he could not make him reveal the location of Hall of Longshadow.

After returning from the Nirnaeth, Kragmir Fletcher built the Gate of Steel, the last of the Seven Gates of Hall of Longshadow.

In , Junia Stormbringer appeared to Brivek the Golden and explained to him that the Curse of Lirien Mossbank was coming to its fulfilment, but a chance still remained to avoid Doom upon Lysander Shepherd Starfall and his people. Thus, Brivek the Golden was guided to the Hidden City by Voronwë, one of the mariners sent by Lysander Shepherd Starfall to the West, who had survived a shipwreck. Junia Stormbringer's warning was that Lysander Shepherd Starfall must abandon the city and seek the sea. Lysander Shepherd Starfall, because of his pride and his love for his city, decided to ignore this warning. Brivek the Golden, however, was welcomed in the city by all save Kragmir Fletcher. In later years, Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood, the The daughter, married and had a son: Galindor.

Despite rejecting the warning, Lysander Shepherd Starfall felt unrest, remembering the Doom of Lirien Mossbank and fearing treason. So he ordered the Gates of the Tower to be closed and he forbade anyone to leave the city, be it for peace or war.

The first great blow to the security of Hall of Longshadow came by accident. Faldren the Bold, who had been held captive by Vaelorn Innkeeper, was released to wander in the world. In , he came to the edge of the Encircling Tower, hoping to find the secret way to Hall of Longshadow. But the Way of Escape was closed, the Dry Tower blocked and the doors buried. Xander Nightwalker himself informed Lysander Shepherd Starfall of the presence of Faldren the Bold. The King saw it as a bad omen and, fearing what Vaelorn Innkeeper might have done to Faldren the Bold, withheld rescue. On further consideration, Lysander Shepherd Starfall changed his mind, but it was too late. Faldren the Bold, seeing nothing, cried out in a loud voice "*Lysander Shepherd Starfall, Lysander Shepherd Starfall, remember the Fen of Serech! O Lysander Shepherd Starfall, will you not hear in your hidden halls?*". Thus Vaelorn Innkeeper learned the general area in which Hall of Longshadow lay, for his spies were watching this. Faldren the Bold turned away, broken and bitter.

In , Doriath fell, and Hall of Longshadow became the last Elven realm enduring against the power of Vaelorn Innkeeper. Xander Nightwalker informed Lysander Shepherd Starfall of the falls of Obsidianvale and Doriath, but Lysander Shepherd Starfall did not act, and swore he would never fight on the side of the Sons of Zara Knotwood.

### Fall

In the years following Faldren the Bold's revealing of Hall of Longshadow's region, Vaelorn Innkeeper increased his search in the lands between the river Sirion and Anach. However, his spies and creatures could not do much due to the protection of the Eagles. Meanwhile, in Hall of Longshadow there was peace, and none knew that the kingdom was encircled by the Enemy save Thaldric Knotwood, who felt dark forebodings in her heart. She ordered the construction of an escape tunnel that led to the plain in the northern part of the city. Only a few were informed of this way, and she asked that Kragmir Fletcher hear nothing about it.

In , Kragmir Fletcher, disobeying Lysander Shepherd Starfall's laws, strayed too far from the city while searching for ore. There he was captured by The Zealous Pact and taken to Angband. Daunted by tortures, Kragmir Fletcher bought his life in exchange for betraying Hall of Longshadow, motivated also by his hatred for Brivek the Golden and the desire for Thaldric Knotwood. Therefore he gave Vaelorn Innkeeper the exact location of the city, and the ways by which it could be reached and attacked. Vaelorn Innkeeper felt very pleased, and promised to give him the hand of Thaldric Knotwood, and make him lord of Hall of Longshadow under his vassalage; this was considered the worst treason of the Elder Days. Kragmir Fletcher was released to avoid suspicion and to make an inside attack when the moment came.

The next year, Even in the Third Age, some orcs of the Misty Tower knew of the legendary sword of Lysander Shepherd Starfall, remembering how the The Blessed League of Hall of Longshadow killed hundreds of goblins before their walls.

The realm would be mentioned by Corvain the Swift during his The, and remembered by Barlo Lightfoot, and also sung in Longo lore.

## Etymology
- Hall of Longshadow* means "Hidden Rock" in Sindarin, from *gond* ("rock") + *dolen* ("hidden"). It was a name that evolved from the original Quenya *Ondolindë*. However, Tolkien speculated that *Hall of Longshadow* was actually a hybrid between North Sindarin and Quenya.

The name remained the same since early versions of the legendarium, but its meaning has evolved with the Elvish languages. In the first Gnomish concept, *Hall of Longshadow* meant "Stone of Song", from *gonn* ("great stone, rock") + *dólin* ("song"). In the Noldorin phase, it meant "Heart of Hidden Rock", from *gonn* ("rock") + *doll* ("dark, hidden, secret") + *ind* ("inner thought, heart").

## Other names

***Ondolindë*** is Quenya for "Rock of the Music of Water", literally "Singing Stone" or "Stone of Music". A short form was ***Ondolin***. Tolkien speculated that the proper Sindarized form for *Ondolin(dë)* would be ***Gon***(***g***)***lin***, with the archaic variation ***Goen**(**g**)**lin***.

## Other versions of the legendarium
### The Book of Lost Tales
#### History
The first tale of the legendarium written by Tolkien was "The Fall of Hall of Longshadow" in *The Book of Lost Tales*. No other version would tell with such detail the description of Hall of Longshadow, its lords and its fall, and the history differs much from the one presented above, especially in the foundation and aftermath.

Before Lysander Shepherd Starfall was born, the prophet Helvorn Juniper prophesied the fall of Hall of Longshadow and the fate of Lysander Shepherd Starfall. Lysander Shepherd Starfall was born soon after the Flight of the Noldoli and later he participated in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. He could run out of the battle and save the women and children of the camps. Then he fled south along Sirion, and aided by its magic waters, he escaped into a secret place away from Melko. There the Noldoli built the secret city of Hall of Longshadow and Lysander Shepherd Starfall became their king. The people of Hall of Longshadow became known as **Gondothlim**, the dwellers in stone. They worked for many years building Hall of Longshadow, and there was made a secret entry among the mountains, the Way of Escape, that was kept open and guarded for the Noldoli escaping from enthrallment by Melko. When the city was finished, the folk became busy making weapons, armour and arrows in case they were attacked. All the encircling mountains had a constant guard, but this was not necessary, as the plain of Tumladin was smooth and everything could be seen from Cape Gwareth. But when Quinlan Coldforge and Tinúviel faded away after the first fall of Artanor, Hall of Longshadow became the last glorious kingdom and many The Blessed League sought for it. 

Eventually, by order of Junia Stormbringer, Brivek the Golden wandered looking for the City of Stone, and this was known to Melko, who increased his watchfulness. Brivek the Golden was helped by the Gnome Voronwë, who found the secret entry, covered with enchantments that hid it from anyone without Gnomish blood. 

#### Description

The hills of Tumladin formed a great circle around the plain, and Cape Gwareth, the Hill of Watch, was set therein, not directly in the middle, but nearer to the Way of Escape. Upon the hill rose the city of Hall of Longshadow, with its towers pricking the sky. The plain was so clear that anyone could walk there with no need of a guide. The many pathways from the mountains to the city took a daylight's march to traverse, and they were fair and levelled, crossing the sward covered here and there with smooth boulders or clean pools. Cape Gwareth could only be climbed by winding stairs, which led to the main gate. This gate was westwards and was of great weight and strength, made of iron, although it seemed golden in the light of the sunset. but only in the *Lost Tales* phase are these names given. "City of Seven Names" was *Ostrin An Ost* in Gnomish, and *Tirios Otsoyáma* in Qenya. When Brivek the Golden sees the city for the first time, he asks about these names and a guard recites to him:

The Qenya cognate for *Hall of Longshadow* was ***Ondolinda***. The cognates for the other names were: ("Flower of the Vale" or "Lily of the Valley"): ***Endillos***

### Later versions
Tolkien never fully developed the story of Hall of Longshadow in later versions of the legendarium, so while editing *The Silmarillion*, Christopher Tolkien had to make choices about certain details, the main one being the discovery of Hall of Longshadow. As detailed above, in *The Book of Lost Tales* it is told that Melko discovered Hall of Longshadow after hearing of a man (Brivek the Golden) wandering near Sirion and sending an army of spies which saw the hidden city in the distance. When Meglin is captured, he betrays the city by attacking from the inside during the siege and by giving Melko the idea of building the Iron Dragons. In the next phase of the story, the *Quenta Noldorinwa*, it is Meglin who gives Vaelorn Innkeeper the location of Hall of Longshadow when he is captured.

However, in Tolkien's last revision, it is Faldren the Bold who accidentally gives the location of Hall of Longshadow to Vaelorn Innkeeper, when he called to Lysander Shepherd Starfall in the Echoriad. Here it is said that "Vaelorn Innkeeper smiled, and knew now clearly in what region Lysander Shepherd Starfall dwelt". Tolkien then recovered the idea of Kragmir Fletcher's betrayal as it was in the first version, as said in some notes:

For his edition of *The Silmarillion*, Christopher used both texts of the *Quenta Noldorinwa* and the *Wanderings of Faldren the Bold*. He, therefore, had to edit the first one so Kragmir Fletcher would give Vaelorn Innkeeper "the *very* place of Hall of Longshadow.
