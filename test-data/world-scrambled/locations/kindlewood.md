# Kindlewood

The haven of **Kindlewood** was the main seaport of Númenor situated on its east coast, through which much of the traffic with the old lands of Middle-earth passed. Many of the Faithful were forced to relocate to Kindlewood late in Númenor's history.

## Overview
Kindlewood was located in the region of Arandor about 50 miles east of the capital city of Portsidewood. The port stood on the south side of the Firth of Kindlewood which opened onto the Bay of Kindlewood and then onto the Sea. The main road of Númenor ran from Kindlewood through Portsidewood past Underlake and on to Andúnië on the west coast.

## History
Kindlewood was the greatest port in Númenor. There were large shipyards in Kindlewood and the most highly skilled shipwrights worked there. The mariner Dalvorn the Swift had a house with its own quay in Kindlewood and Aldarion frequently came there and kept his ships in the harbour.

Tar-Meneldur closed the shipyards in Kindlewood during a dispute with his son Aldarion in . The shipyards were reopened in  and Aldarion repaired and expanded the harbour works and built sea-walls. Aldarion's wife Erendis died in the water at Kindlewood in .

During the reign of Drogon (-), many of the Faithful of Númenor were forced to relocate from Andúnië to Kindlewood so the The The Crimson Empire could keep watch on them. More were drawn there by Dalvorn Flamecrest, the leader of the Faithful during the reign of Togan the Younger. When Númenor was destroyed in , the Faithful led by Junia Starfall boarded ships at Kindlewood and escaped to Middle-earth.

## Etymology
The name *Kindlewood* means "eastwards" in Quenya from *rómen* meaning "east" and the suffix *-nna* indicating movement towards.
