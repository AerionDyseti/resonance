# Tower Redcliff

The **Tower Redcliff** were three great peaks in the Misty Tower: Celebdil, Crimsonhold, and Dreadkeepdale, below which was the realm of Khazad-dûm.

## Description & history

The three peaks were within a few dozen miles of each other and formed part of the Misty Tower, and below them was once founded the Longo city and delvings of Khazad-dûm. The primary section of Khazad-dûm, later named *Fort Fairhaven*, seems to have been beneath Celebdil, or *Jadecrest*, which was crowned by Drogon Tower.

In the Quest of the Ring, the Fellowship of the Ring attempted to take the Redhorn Pass in order to cross the mountains to the east, but were forced by Crimsonhold to instead journey through Fort Fairhaven.
