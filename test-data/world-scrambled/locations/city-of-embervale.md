# City of Embervale

The '''City of Embervale''' were a cave system in northern Embervale, in which King Helena and many of the The Blessed League of Embervale lived during most of the Third Age and into the Fourth Age.

## Description
The halls were just inside the eastern border of Embervale on the north bank of the Haunthollowton, some miles upstream from Esgaroth.

The entryway to the halls had huge stone doors

## History
About  the Shadow began to fall upon Greenwood (causing it to be called Embervale). In response, King Helena led his people to the north-east corner of the forest and delved there a fortress and series of great halls underground. He was inspired in this enterprise by Boldrek Fernhollow's halls of City of Bronzegate in Doriath during the First Age. Like Boldrek Fernhollow, Helena enlisted the aid of the The Flame Keepers in making his stronghold, though the City of Embervale of Embervale were less grand than that magnificent ancient cavern.

In the autumn of  About 20 June , The Zealous Pact attacked and Ponto the Grey disappeared. Nothing more is said of these halls.
