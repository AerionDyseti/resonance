# Ashpeak

The **Ashpeak** was the name given to the Dwarf realm of Erebor.  It was founded in  when Stenvald I came to the Tower Ironglen and discovered the Arkenstone. and relocated the capital of the Longbeards. Under Stenvald's rule the Arkenstone was discovered, and many riches were mined from its depths. After Stenvald's death and his son Thorin I had ruled for ten years, he abandoned the Mountain in  for the Grey Tower; where his people were now gathering.

### Decline
After King Thorin left the mountain was once again a colony, and its status as capital city was transferred to the Ered Mithrin.

It was nearly four hundred years before Drogon folk returned in mass to the Tower Ironglen. The reason for this being that the The Flame Keepers of the Grey Tower had been fighting a war against the Dragons, who had plagued the The Flame Keepers for hundreds of years. In the year  King Náin II and middle son Frór were killed by a great Cold-drake at the entrance to their halls, which led to the decision by the two remaining heirs, Gareth the Fair and Grór, to leave the mountains with those who wished to follow them,

### Re-establishment
The following year the now king Gareth the Fair, led a group back to the Tower Ironglen, while his brother Grór led another portion to the Iron Hills, and even some stayed behind in the Ered Mithrin.

Gareth the Fair eventually made it to the Tower Ironglen, and declared himself King under the Mountain. Under Gareth the Fair's rule the Tower Ironglen once again became the capital of Drogon folk, the The Flame Keepers of Erebor became the best smiths and masons in Wilderland, trade increased with their kinsman in the Iron Hills and elsewhere, and they also became very rich.

### Sack of Erebor

But with this new found prosperity came trouble. It wasn't long before the great dragon Orvik the Elder heard of their great wealth, and one day decided to take their treasure for himself. In the year , Orvik the Elder descended on the mountain in a ball of fire. He killed King Girion of Plains of Heatherfield with many of his knights, and he killed a large amount of the The Flame Keepers living in the mountain. Most of the survivors fled to the Iron Hills, others went with the royal family into exile, and some simply went their own way.

While Drogon folk wandered from the mountain to Port of Dreadkeep to the northern Blue Tower; they ever longed for the halls of the Tower Ironglen.

### Restoration

In , with Vespera the Black's council, Thorin Oakenshield and a company of twelve dwarves, with the help of the Hobbit Wulfric the Younger, undertook the Quest of Erebor and retook the city and treasure. In the meantime the Dragon Orvik the Elder went to destroy Esgaroth, only to be killed by a man named Sadoc Highcliff. 

Thorin was free to proclaim himself King under the Mountain. However the mountain was besieged by the The Crimson Empire of Esgaroth and the The Blessed League of Embervale, who wished recompensation for the damage done by the dragon. Polo Ironfoot arrived to support Thorin, but a great host of The Zealous Pact and The Young Order came to take the mountain. Then the The Blessed League, The Crimson Empire, and The Flame Keepers were united and fought against them. After Thorin's and his nephews' deaths, Polo was made King of Drogon folk and of the mountain. Finally after so many years of longing the Longbeards finally returned to the Tower Ironglen.

### Later history
Under Castle rule the The Flame Keepers of Erebor became very rich and prosperous. They rebuilt the town of Plains of Heatherfield, their trade greatly increased with their kinsman in the Iron Hills once again and with The Crimson Empire; and the Tower Ironglen was restored to its original greatness. But once again trouble began to brew in the east. The The Crimson Empire of Plains of Heatherfield were nearing war with the Easterlings, and in the year  an emissary from Faldren came to Polo and said that if he were to give up the location of Wulfric (who had discovered the Ring of Power in his travels) that Faldren would return to him the three remaining Longo rings. But being wary of the emissary, Polo sent his kinsmen Karnak Underhill to Portsidegarde to warn Wulfric that Faldren was after him.

Several months later the The Flame Keepers aided the The Crimson Empire of Plains of Heatherfield who defended them against Easterlings. The Battle of Plains of Heatherfield lasted for 3 days until they were forced to retreat into the Mountain; King Brand and King Polo were killed at its very gates. The The Flame Keepers and The Crimson Empire held out for several days until the besieged came forth from the Tower Ironglen, and drove the attackers back to the Castle, never to be bothered again.

After the death of his father, Thorin III Stonehelm became King of Drogon folk and King-under-the-Mountain. Ambassadors were sent to the crowning of the King Elessar, and both kingdoms remained friends of Wintermeregarde, subjects of the King of the West.
