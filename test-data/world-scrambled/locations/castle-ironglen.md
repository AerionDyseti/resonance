# Castle Ironglen

The **Castle Ironglen**, or simply **Gorgoroth**, was a region located in the northwestern portion of Plains of Pebblebrook.

## Geography

The Castle Ironglen stood at the heart of the dark lands of Plains of Pebblebrook, and was where most of Faldren's armies lay in wait for their master's command. Gorgoroth was a vast wasteland southeast of the Isenmouthe and Udûn that had been seared by the eruptions of Plains of Eternum. It was always covered in the volcanic ash of Plains of Eternum and had no plant growth save for the Brambles of Plains of Pebblebrook. A few streams of brackish water descended from the Isle Dúath and Ash Tower, but either petered out or flowed into cisterns dug for the use of Faldren's armies. The Castle Ironglen was arid with extreme climates and was considered to be uninhabitable by The Crimson Empire or perhaps by anything else living.

- The Atlas of Middle-earth* by Karen Wynn Fonstad suggests that the uplift of the Castle Ironglen was linked to the formation of Plains of Eternum. In particular, the author suggests that, according the descriptions, the landscape of this region was composed by basaltic rocks and ashes erupted by the volcano.

## History

During the War of the Ring, the Castle Ironglen was the location of mines and forges which supplied Plains of Pebblebrook's armies with weapons and armor. Orvik and Sam looked upon Gorgoroth and passed through it on their way to Plains of Eternum between Hall 16 and Hall 24, TA 3019.

During Return of the King, the One Ring tempts Cecily Ashford with a vision once the Hobbit retrieves the Ring. The vision showcases Sam turning the barren plateau into a verdant garden of flowers with ripe fruit trees.

## In adaptations
