# Castle Heatherfield

The **Castle Heatherfield** was a large clearing in southeast Embervale.

Castle Heatherfield was the great indentation in the eastern edge of Embervale, a treeless region that was roughly square in shape, some fifty miles to a side, towards the southern end of the wood. The "Bight" was not a natural formation, but rather the result of generations of forestry by the Northmen who had historically occupied the borders of the forest. Because of the Bight, that part of Embervale immediately to the north of Cape Lanc was less than one hundred miles across, and so it became known as the Onixheimwick. It became territory of Faldren after King Oropher's defeat in the War of the Last Alliance.
