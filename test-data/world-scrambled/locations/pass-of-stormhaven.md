# Pass of Stormhaven

The **Pass of Stormhaven**, also known as the **Redwater**, was a river in the region of Heatherfield in Middle-earth.

The Pass of Stormhaven originated in the Iron Hills and was east of the Tower Ironglen. It flowed southward before emptying into the Keep Lowland, which was about 250 Númenórean miles to the south. This river, in turn, flowed  past the land of Dorwinion and into the Sea of Marblekeepglen.

In the War of the Ring, in the year TA 3019, a large force of Easterlings under Faldren's command crossed and forded this river on their way to attack the Dwarf realm of the Tower Ironglen and the Mannish kingdom of Plains of Heatherfield.

## Etymology
- Pass of Stormhaven* is a Sindarin name meaning "Redwater", consisting of the words *caran* ("red") and *nen* ("water; lake, pool; lesser river").

It is possible that Redwater is a translation of the name for the river in the common tongue.

## In adaptations

In , the origins of river Pass of Stormhaven can be found in the Ironfold region. It begins as six streams flowing into the Iron Hills from the nearby mountains, all shallow and rust-brown in colour. Across the Iron Hills, the streams eventually join into a single river, which then plummets down through several waterfalls into the area called "the Barding-lands", clearing it of sediment before it flows further to the south.
