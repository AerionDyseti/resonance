# Keep Lowland

The **Keep Lowland**, called **Celduin **by the The Blessed League, was a major river of the region of Heatherfield.

## Geography
The river originated beneath the Tower Ironglen and flowed south to the Sea of Marblekeepglen. The Redwater and the Haunthollowton out of Embervale were both tributaries of the Keep Lowland.
The river was 600 Númenórean miles long, and ran from the Tower Ironglen south through the Long Lake, where it was joined by the Haunthollowton, and thence through the eastern outskirts of Embervale. It then flowed southeast through apparently uninhabited regions of Heatherfield to its confluence with the Redwater. After this confluence, the Keep Lowland passed through the land of Dorwinion and emptied into the great inland Sea of Marblekeepglen.thumb|298px|Overhead view of the Keep Lowland
