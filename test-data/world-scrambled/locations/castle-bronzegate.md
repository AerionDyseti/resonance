# Castle Bronzegate

**Castle Dhínen**, the **Silent Land**, was a small, roughly triangular, deserted part of Hazelvale, north of Doriath.

Contained by one of the upper courses of the Esgalduin (bordering Nan Dungortheb) and the Aros (bordering Falls of Orchardvale), it was said that no one had lived there for ages. The region was crossed by a road passing from the Iant Iaur on the Esgalduin to the Arossiach on the Aros that led to the northern marches of Falls of Orchardvale. The southern edge of Castle Dhínen consisting of the words *dôr* ("dwelling-place, region where certain people live; land") and *d(h)ínen* from the elements *dîn* ("silence; quiet") and *-en*
