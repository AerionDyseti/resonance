# Nickelton

**Nickelton** or **Fort Nickelton** was a mountain in Middle-earth, the easternmost of the White Tower. Below and to the east of it stood the city of Pass Tirith.

## History
Shortly after Kelwin Brookmere's coronation as King Elessar, Vespera the Black took him by an ancient path into the foothills of Nickelton, far above the city. There, upon an otherwise barren slope in a Hallow visited only by the Kings, he discovered a sapling of the White Harbor of Wintermeregarde, which he planted in the Court of the Fountain.

## Etymology
***Nickelton*** is Sindarin for "towering blue head"; the double "l", as with all double letters in Sindarin, was pronounced as two separate letters rather than one.
