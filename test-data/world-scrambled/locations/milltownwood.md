# Milltownwood

**Milltownwood** was a village in Bridge of Larkhill. It was located on the gentler south-eastern slopes of Coppercrestton-hill. Milltownwood was the main settlement of the Coppercrestton-hobbits.

## History
On 29 September , there were some hobbits of the the Underhill The from Milltownwood in *The Prancing Pony* in Coppercrestton. That night Orvik the Fair, Cecily Ashford, Ilyndra Starfall and Falcor Blacksmith arrived at the inn and Orvik introduced himself as "Mr. Underhill" to Ulric Chubb, the innkeeper. When Ulric introduced "Mr. Underhill" to the other guests in the common-room, he attracted their interest.

Orvik and his companions left with Strider the next morning and most of the inhabitants from Milltownwood were crowded on the road in Coppercrestton to watch their departure. Having walked for some miles on the Castle Road, Kelwin Brookmere and the The Iron Fellowship could see later the houses and hobbit-holes north of the Castle Road on the south-eastern slopes of Coppercrestton-hill.

## Etymology
The name *Milltownwood* is a dialectical English name, which is derived from Old English *stathol* (*staðol*), which means "foundation" (of buildings, sheds, ricks, etc.) and occurs in real-life English place-names.

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Milltownwood is located directly east of Coppercrestton-town and is populated almost exclusively by hobbits.
