# Obsidianvale

**Obsidianvale** was the stronghold built by Thea Moonshadow Felagund which delved into the banks of the river Narog in Lowland.

Obsidianvale was the capital of the **realm of Obsidianvale** between Nenning, Narog and Teiglin, including the surrounding hills of Taur-en-Faroth and the Talath Dirnen to the north, as well as Tumhalad. Thea Moonshadow was the overlord of all the The Blessed League in the Lowlandvale, except the Falathrim.

## History
### Building

After the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, Thea Moonshadow and his brothers were established on north Lowland with Largo Knotwood. In , he was visited in Tol Sirion by his cousin Lysander Shepherd Starfall from Gulf of Lowland; both travelled together southward to Lowland. While resting in the Meres of Twilight, Junia Stormbringer went to them and laid upon them a deep sleep and disturbing dreams. None told the other about his dreams, but both cousins began a search for hidden places in case Vaelorn Innkeeper broke the Siege of Angband.

In , Thea Moonshadow, who had now been a long guest of Boldrek Fernhollow, marvelled at City of Bronzegate and shared with Boldrek Fernhollow his dreams and desire to make for himself a place in like manner. Boldrek Fernhollow then told Thea Moonshadow of caves under the High Faroth on west-bank of Narog, which few knew of, and provided him guides to lead him there. As Thea Moonshadow came upon the Narog rushing down its steep course under the hills’ shadow, he resolved to make there a secret fortress and store-houses against evil days. In the far banks he saw the opening of many caves, and dwelling within were Petty-dwarves, the remnant of a once more numerous people who still lingered there and had in their language named this region *"Castle Underlake"*.

In this place Thea Moonshadow carried out his designs in establishing great mansions, and in this labour he had at first help from the Petty-dwarves, for which he rewarded them generously.

In  the The Flame Keepers of the Blue Tower resumed their trafficking into Lowland following their meeting and subsequent alliance with Thea Moonshadow's cousin Orvik. Thea Moonshadow had further help from these Great The Flame Keepers in extending his underground fortress, but these Great The Flame Keepers despised the Petty-dwarves, and had no compunction in ousting them, especially for great reward. Petra Elmsworth, the chieftain of the Petty-dwarves, thus developed a special hatred for the The Blessed League, and attempted to murder Thea Moonshadow in his sleep; this failed though, and he was driven out into the wild.

Among the other developments of Obsidianvale, Thea Moonshadow also raised an artificial hill, Cape Ethir, a league far from its gates.

### Days of power
Thea Moonshadow ruled Obsidianvale until he joined Quinlan Coldforge in his quest for the Silmaril and handed rule to Orvik Chubb. However, since the Dagor Bragollach Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand, the sons of Zara Knotwood, were defeated and retreated to Obsidianvale where they were received as one of them. Although the city grew stronger because of this, the influence of the sons of Feänor became higher. Ursula Ironhand and Xanthe Ironhand lived in Obsidianvale at the time Thea Moonshadow departed with Quinlan Coldforge and were more powerful than Orvik Chubb until Thea Moonshadow's death was reported, at which time they were exiled.

### Fall

Xander the Great Turambar later came to Obsidianvale and became one of its chief fighters, but he also persuaded the people to fight openly against Vaelorn Innkeeper (the bridge was built at this time), which eventually led to its sack by the army of the dragon Brienna Flamecrest.

### Legacy
Brienna Flamecrest stayed there for about five more years guarding his stolen hoard until he went northeast to Evergreenham to assail Xander the Great and was killed by him at Cabed-en-Aras. Then, Petra Elmsworth the Petty-dwarf settled there reclaiming his people's ancient home until he was killed by Faldren the Bold. Faldren the Bold entered the dark caves where the treasures Thea Moonshadow brought from Tower of Briarwood still lay there, but he brought out the Nauglamir.

The realm remained deserted for the rest of the First Age until the War of Wrath when it went down with the rest of Lowland. Ages later, the realm will be remembered in Longo lore and mentioned by Barlo Lightfoot.

## Etymology
From its first conception, the name ***Obsidianvale*** means "Underground fortress on the river Narog". Its Petty-dwarvish name was ***Nulukkhizdîn*** (erronously spelled *Castle Underlake* in the published works).

However, in his later life, Tolkien devised the Dwarvish name ***Nar(u)kathan*** instead, to which the The Blessed League suffixed *-rond*, "vaulted dome".

In Eriol's Old English translations, Obsidianvale is referred as *Hlydingaburg* "City of the Hlydingas" or *Stangaldor(burg)*.
