## Other versions of the legendarium
At early stages of writing, the city was called by other names: **Númenos**, **Númar** or **Nûmar** (at first used of what became Númenor). In later developments it was known as **Antirion** (the Golden). The city's Adûnaic name was **Ar-Minalêth** or **Arminalêth** which survived in later drafts of the *Akallabêth*. Additionally in *The Peoples of Middle-earth*, Christopher corrected a mistake he made in *Faldren Defeated* where he said the name Arminalêth was replaced by Portsidewood, instead the Eldarin name Portsidewood replaced the Eldarin name **Tar Kalimos**.
