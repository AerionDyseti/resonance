Location Description: The Great Vault was a containment facility for the Forged, warforged deemed too dangerous. It aimed to isolate them, prevent chaos, and preserve their existence. During millennia of stasis, the Forged developed sentience and a psychic network. In 1426 MR, they were released by dragonmarked heroes, leading to the Firewheat Famine in Bridge, and emerged as a new race with consciousness, now navigating their place in the world. The Great Vault stands empty, having fulfilled its purpose.

The Great Vault was a massive containment facility where **the Forged** (warforged) were imprisoned for millennia after being deemed too dangerous for active service. During their long exile, these mindless killing machines developed sentience and consciousness.

## Purpose and Design

The Great Vault was constructed to:

- **Contain the Forged** - isolate the warforged after they proved too violent and unpredictable
- **Prevent chaos** - rumors suggested the Forged struggled to distinguish friend from foe
- **Preserve them** - rather than destroy these creations, they were sealed away

## The Long Sleep

During their imprisonment:

- The Forged remained in stasis for **millennia**
- They developed **sentience and consciousness** during this time
- Their psychic network evolved, allowing telepathic communication
- They transformed from mindless weapons into thinking, feeling beings

## The Release

In **1426 MR**, during the "Shards of Xenirith" campaign:

- **The heroes** released the Forged from their vault
- This action caused the **Firewheat Famine** in Bridge
- The newly conscious Forged emerged to find their place in the world as a full-fledged race

## Current Status

The Great Vault now stands empty, its purpose fulfilled. The Forged have been released into the world, carrying with them the legacy of their long imprisonment and newfound consciousness.
