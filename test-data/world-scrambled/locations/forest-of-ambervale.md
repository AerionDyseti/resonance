# Forest of Ambervale

**Forest of Ambervale** was the name of a village that threatened the town of Ebonwatchhaven with marauders during the Second Age.

## History
All that is known of the location of Forest of Ambervale is that it was "far inland" from Ebonwatchhaven, which was "three leagues away" from the shores of the Great Sea.

When Tal-Elmar was seventeen he was chosen to go to Forest of Ambervale to spy out the land. The young man was successful in finding the village and creeping so close to one of its watchmen's huts that he could hear their conversation. However, he was unable to comprehend their words although their tone suggested fear and mourning.

What Tal-Elmar did not know was that the people of Forest of Ambervale, known as the Forest of Ambervale-folk, were dying from a pestilence and that the marauders who had come to Ebonwatchhaven were desperately seeking food.
