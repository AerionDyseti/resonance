### Overview

- Discovery: Bridge Grotto beneath the surface tree, where Vek‑Khar (The Anointer) was found deceased; see [Bridge Grotto (The United Republic Ruin)](Bridge%20Grotto%20(City%20Kingdoms%20Ruin)%20384e696fa1e24ebba924cfebef2040b6.md).

A distant oasis in the Mistholmemere tied to Oriana’s "miracle" water. The source appears magically potent with a faint necromantic resonance. Estimated ~1 week travel from Granitekeepfell by caravan. Rumored landmarks along the route include shifting dunes and carved waystones used by Dragonborn pilgrims.

### Session Role — KtP #3: Seeing Miracles

- Identified as the probable source of the Anointer’s water
- Target of the party’s planned expedition pending writ and supplies
- Context for sampling and hypothesis about faint necromantic resonance

## City Research Station (Cistern)

The underground cistern beneath the oasis was identified as **Harmonic Research Station Seven**—an ancient City facility studying "the voice of creation."

### Translated Inscription (Session 11)

Thea used Comprehend Languages to translate rubbings from the cistern walls:

*"Harmonic Research Station Seven. Here we study the voice of creation—sound born from the union of opposing forces. Research focus: resonance applications in shaping, sealing, and defense. Attend the pillars. Harmony is fragile. Imbalanced frequencies cause structural failure and tissue damage."*

### Magical Technology

The party dubbed this "Ancient City OSHA notes." Knowledge (Arcana) checks revealed:

- **Power Source**: Positive and negative energy reactions (standard City technology)
- **Novel Research**: Application of this power to *sonic magic*—sound-based shaping, sealing, and defense
- **The Pillars**: The resonant pillars encountered during the Mirathel Burrows battle were part of this research infrastructure
- **Scholarly Significance**: Thea recognized this as "an entire PhD thesis by itself"—groundbreaking magical technology that combined energy manipulation with acoustic applications
