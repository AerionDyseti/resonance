# Highgate

The **Highgate** formed a part of the southern Echoriad and were home to the The Wayfarers of Xander Nightwalker. 

The great Eagles moved to the Highgate after The return to City of Thornbury. It was here that Xander Nightwalker, the Lord of the Eagles lived, and from here he watched for spies attempting to find the hidden city of Hall of Longshadow in the vale of the Tower Sirion.

## Etymology

***Highgate*** is Sindarin for "cleft mountain peaks", but in Tolkien's stories the place is usually referred to as **Cirith Thoronath**, the "Eagles' Cleft", or "Abode of Eagles" because the peaks were inaccessible from the ground.
