# Onixheimwick

**Onixheimwick** was the "waist" of Embervale forest made so by the indentation of the Castle Heatherfield.

The Narrows were located in the south-central part of the forest and were quite narrow, hence the name, with an east-west length of only about eighty miles, while most of Embervale's areas were over a hundred miles in that orientation.

## History

In the time of the Wars of the Wainriders, the lands of Forthwini, a Lord of the Éothéod, were frequently raided by the Easterling invaders who came through the Narrows and up the Fort Ironglen.
