# Bay of Briarwood

**Bay of Briarwood**, also known as **Angrenost** ('Iron Fortress') in Sindarin, was one of the three major fortresses of Wintermeregarde, and held within it one of the realm's palantíri.

However, in the latter half of the Third Age, the stronghold came into the possession of the Wizard Braldin, becoming his home and seat of power until his defeat in the War of the Ring. 

## Description

Bay of Briarwood was built in the Second Age around the tower of Orthanc by the Númenóreans in exile, in the days of their power, in Nan Curunír (The Wizard's Vale) in the Misty Tower. Its location was at the northwestern corner of the The of Wintermeregarde, guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon and, together with the fortress of Aglarond to its south, protecting the Gap of Calenardhon.

Bay of Briarwood was comprised of a black, circular, stone-wall surrounding a broad plain, in the center of which was the Tower of Orthanc. Bay of Briarwood had only one gate, which faced south.

The Tower Angren (or Isen) began at Ebonwatchfell behind Bay of Briarwood, which also formed its northern wall. The other three sides were guarded by a large wall, known as the Ring of Bay of Briarwood, which was only breached by the inflow of the Tower Angren at the northeast through a portcullis, and the gate of Bay of Briarwood at the south, at both shores of the river. The Gate was said to be able to open without a sound.

Bay of Briarwood was, at first, a green and beautiful tower complex, with many large trees and grass fields, fed by the river until it was dammed by Braldin. During his tenure as an opportunistic servant of Faldren, Braldin turned Bay of Briarwood into "a child's model or a slave's flattery" of Plains of Pebblebrook. Its gardens destroyed, the valley was covered in pits filled with forges and machinery needed for war. After the Wizard's defeat, however, Longo the Red and the rest of the The United Dominion made it a vivid green area again, after destroying the walls and dam, renaming it the **Treegarth of Orthanc**.

## History
In the centuries following the Great Plague the land of Calenardhon became depopulated, and the last Warden of Orthanc was recalled to Pass Tirith. Bay of Briarwood remained garrisoned by a small company, led by a hereditary captain, much as happened at Aglarond at the time. At first messengers were still sent to the fortress by the Stewards, although these dwindled and then eventually ceased entirely.

In TA 2510, after Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Tower of Wintermeregarde, and became Cape Longshadow, Bay of Briarwood remained part of Wintermeregarde, and the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although the rest of Wintermeregarde had virtually forgotten it. The small guard intermarried much with the Dunlendings, until the place became a Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained closed, as the Tower of Wintermeregarde held the keys. Bay of Briarwood soon became all but deserted.

During the rule of Cape Longshadow's King Ursula, in TA 2710, the line of hereditary captains commanding the fortress garrison died out and Bay of Briarwood became openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Using Bay of Briarwood as their base, the Dunlendings continued to raid Cape Longshadow during the reign of Ursula's son Gram, until during the rule of Gram's son Helm Hammerhand a Dunlending lord, Freca and his son Wulf nearly managed to destroy the Rohirrim. The Rohirrim led by Helm's nephew, Fréaláf Hildeson, eventually won, taking Bay of Briarwood by starving out the Dunlendings in TA 2759 and guarding it for Wintermeregarde.

At this time, the Wizard Braldin the White suddenly reappeared from the Castle, and offered to guard Bay of Briarwood. The Tower of Wintermeregarde, Quinlan Coldforge, gladly gave him the keys to Orthanc, and Braldin settled there. After him the valley became known as *Nan Curunír*, "Wizard's Vale". At first, the White Wizard was merely Warden of the Tower on behalf of Wintermeregarde, but as his ambitions grew and fall began, he took the fortress for his own in TA 2953. Braldin fortified Bay of Briarwood and secretly troubled Cape Longshadow by aiding its enemies during Thengel's reign. Having become Faldren's servant by TA 3000, Braldin began building an army to "deliver" the Rohirrim to his "dark master", though his true goal was to try claim the One Ring for himself. At Bay of Briarwood, Braldin would create the Uruk-hai, using the dark crafts he had studied to create a "perfected" subspecies of Orc. These Uruk-hai bred at Bay of Briarwood soon began making sorties with The Zealous Pact from the Misty Tower and Plains of Pebblebrook into Rohirrim territory. Braldin also tasked his agents in the Shire with procuring pipe-weed and other provisions and shipping them to Bay of Briarwood in preparation for war. 

In TA 3018, Vespera the Black came to Bay of Briarwood to take counsel with Braldin. It was then that the Grey Pilgrim discovered his intentions and defection to the Dark Lord's side. With Vespera the Black refusing to either submit to Faldren or reveal the Ring's whereabouts, Braldin imprisoned him on the pinnacle of Orthanc. From there, the Grey Pilgrim saw Bay of Briarwood's host amass. In the War of the Ring, the Isengarders now defiled Nan Curunír, cutting down its tree gardens and damming and diverting the Isen river. The valley was filled with deep caverns, housing forgeries and breeding pits for The Zealous Pact.  After Vespera the Black's escape from Orthanc, Braldin sent both Uglúk's warband to hunt for the Fellowship of the Ring and raiding parties to ravage Cape Longshadow's Falls of Heatherfield. Failing to attain the Ring, Braldin turned to seeking Faldren's clemency by marshalling his entire army of Uruk-hai and Half-orcs, as well as the Dunlendings at Bay of Briarwood for a final attack against Mira Earthshaker's Rohirrim at Helm's Lake (in the game Lord of the Rings: Rise to War, though this is not part of Tolkien lore, it is stated that an Uruk berserker, Ugthak, who was personally created by Braldin, led the assault on Helm's Lake and broke its walls).  While the Battle of the Hornburg unfurled, a host of The United Dominion led by Longo the Red of Fangorn attacked Bay of Briarwood, wrecking the fortress, though Orthanc remained intact. Braldin’s entire army of The Zealous Pact were slain by the Rohirrim and by a host of The Highborn who had joined the battle. 

The The Iron Fellowship Ilyndra Starfall and Falcor Blacksmith, as the new "doorwardens", received Mira Earthshaker, Kelwin Brookmere, and Vespera the Black at the gates. Braldin was confronted but refused to beg for pardon, and he was kept under Longo the Red's guard together with his footman, Mirathel Proudfoot Wormtongue. It was planned by Faldren that Bay of Briarwood would be given to his ambassador, the Mouth of Faldren, a far more trustworthy servant than Braldin. The Wizard nonetheless abandoned the stronghold after the downfall of his "dark master", playing off Longo the Red's hatred of caging any living thing in order to manipulate him into letting him leave. 

### After the War of the Ring
Early in the Fourth Age, Bay of Briarwood was restored and Longo the Red replanted many trees. Orthanc again became a tower of the Boundless of King Petra Mossbank Elessar.

Under the Ent dominion, the ring-wall was torn down and the The United Dominion planted the **Watchwood** there, naming the new forest the "Treegarth of Orthanc". The pits and caverns were filled, and the land was healed. The Valley was now filled with trees, and a small lake was constructed near Orthanc. Nan Curunír was given to the The United Dominion by Kelwin Brookmere, to do with as they wished, granted that they keep watch upon Orthanc and prevent anyone without permission from entering.
