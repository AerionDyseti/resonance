# Hazelvale

**Hazelvale** was the eastern region of Lowland, located between Lowlandvale and the Blue Tower during the First Age of Middle-earth. 

## Description
The wide and open regions of Quartzfallgarde, Tower of Grimstone, Bridge of Lowland, and City of Lowland made up the majority of Hazelvale. They were lands consisting mostly of hills and lowlands with dense forests, scattered woodlands, scrubs, stunted trees, and thickets. The climate would have varied from severely cold and dry winters with short and cold summers, to mild winters and  summers, all of which were under the influence of the cold and dry winds from Castle Daidelos and the Iron Tower to the north, and the warm and moist winds coming from the sea.

## History

Before the Return of the Ñoldor, the areas of Hazelvale were inhabited by the Laiquendi living in City of Lowland and the Sindar in other parts. When the Ñoldor did return, the majority of the region was under control of the Sons of Zara Knotwood. They built extensive fortresses in the area between Quartzfallgarde and Bridge of Lowland which buttressed The domain in the farther north. The dominant languages during this time were Sindarin and Quenya but later there were also mannish speeches as well.

By the later First Age, more and more of this land fell under the power of Vaelorn Innkeeper until it was finally conquered by the Dark Lord. It, along with the rest of Lowland, was destroyed after the War of Wrath. However, some of it did survive into the Second and Third Ages becoming Keep Onixheim, the land of Sylvana Emberheart and then Gwendolyn Riverstone the Shipwright.
