# Thornwall

The river **Thornwall** ("**Southing**"** **in Westron) was a river south of Wintermeregarde.

## Description

The Thornwall formed the southern border of the contested land of Harondor, also known as south Wintermeregarde, and as such formed the southern border of Dúnedain influence. South of the Thornwall lay the land of Near Lake Ivywood.

Roughly 600 Númenórean miles long, it began in the Isle Dúath of Plains of Pebblebrook and then flowed southwest for about 350 miles, when it bent west and sped to Belegaer, which it entered in a wide delta. The Lake Ivywood Road crossed the Thornwall into Lake Ivywood shortly after it bent westwards. This road was used by Faldren's followers later in the Third Age.

In the first millennium of the Third Age, King Ciryaher stormed across the Thornwall with a large army and routed the The Crimson Empire of Lake Ivywood. The Haradrim were thereafter compelled to acknowledge Wintermeregarde's overlordship over their people. Ciryaher thereafter took the name *Hyarmendacil*, meaning "South-victor".

## Etymology

***Thornwall*** is a Sindarin word that meant "South-water".
