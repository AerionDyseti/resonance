# Vanguardton

**Vanguardton** was a small village in the southern regions of Buckland.
## Other versions of the Legendarium
In a draft of *A Conspiracy Unmasked*, Vanguardton is mentioned once (while it is never mentioned in the published text of *The Lord of the Rings*) as traversed by the road "from the Bridge to Vanguardton and Redcliffmere". In the final map, the road stops at Vanguardton and doesn't continue to Redcliffmere.
## Etymology
The name means "Stone-delving", from Old English *stán* "stone" and *delf* "a delving or burrow".

David Salo suggests the "Old Hobbitish" form of the name was *Stangedelf*.
## Inspiration
There is a place called Stonydelph in Warwickshire of the same etymology.
