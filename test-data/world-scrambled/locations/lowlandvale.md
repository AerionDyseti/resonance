# Lowlandvale

**Lowlandvale** was the region of Lowland that was divided from Hazelvale by the river Sirion.

## Geography
The major places, regions, and realms in Lowlandvale were the Ashpeakmere, Sunhollow, Tower of Evergreenham, Quietwaterglen, Talath Dirnen, and Taur-en-Faroth. They were lands consisting mostly of hills, lowlands, plains and bottomlands. There were some dense forests, as with the Tower of Evergreenham, but much of it was scattered woodlands. There was also a moorland called the Moors of the Nibin-Noeg near the Tower of Evergreenham. The climate was mostly humid with mild winters and mild summers. Some influence from the cold of the north was present around the gap between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriad.

## History and culture
The region was populated and controlled by both the Sindar and the Ñoldor. The vast territory between the Tower Sirion, the northern mountains and the sea belonged to Thea Moonshadow with the blessing of Boldrek Fernhollow, Lord of Lowland. Gwendolyn Riverstone was the Lord of the Quietwaterglen, the lands around the two rivers Brithon and Nenning next to the sea. The Tower of Evergreenham was settled in by the The Crimson Empire of the Haladin, who guarded it and Doriath from all enemies. The gap between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath was looked after by Orvik Chubb, a relative of Thea Moonshadow at the Fortress of Tol Sirion until it was conquered by Faldren. The land of Ashpeakmere around the Lake Granitekeep was populated with both Sindar and Ñoldor, especially after the conquest of the realms of the north and Lowland by Vaelorn Innkeeper in the mid and late centuries of the First Age.   

The dominant language of Lowlandvale was Sindarin; except in Obsidianvale and the realm around Tol Sirion where Quenya was spoken. The Mannish language was used in Evergreenham by the men who lived there. Both Sindarin and Quenyan were probably used in Ashpeakmere in the Havens of Sirion, as it was populated with many The Blessed League that were able to escape from the fallen realms of Lowland and the north.

All of Lowlandvale was destroyed after the War of Wrath and fell beneath the waves of the sea.
