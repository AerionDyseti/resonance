# Greenhillhold

Location Description: A vast underground cavern contains four pools that manipulate time in unique ways: the Slow Pool reverses aging and reveals past visions; the Medium Pool, which appears normal, teleports objects to an explosion's center, causing dangerous outcomes; the Fast Pool accelerates aging and shows possible futures; and the corrupted Green Pool, which is hazardous and has consumed a The, reveals ominous visions. The connection between the Medium Pool and a future catastrophe explains the presence of green crystals in the area.

## Overview

A vast cavern deep within the Lake Knightfall containing four pools that interact with time in different ways.

## Description

Greenhillhold occupy a massive underground cavern, with four distinct basins of water that glow with different intensities and colors. Natural stepping-stones form pathways between the pools, allowing careful navigation.

## The Bay Pools

### Slow Pool (Past)

- Glows with a dim, amber light
- Objects dipped in the water experience age reversal
- Looking into it can show visions of one's past

### Medium Pool (Present)

- Appears normal at first glance
- Objects disappear then shoot out from specific arc locations
- **Dangerous truth**: Teleports objects to the center of an explosion that echoes backward and forward through time
- Witnessed: A The that fell in emerged as two identical copies, shredded and burned "like they'd been at center of massive explosion"

### Fast Pool (Future)

- Shimmers with accelerated movement
- Ages things rapidly
- Looking into it can show visions of possible futures

### Green Pool (Corrupted)

- Sickly green glow that shouldn't exist
- Wrong, corrupted, dangerous
- Consumed a The who fell in—bubbled and boiled
- Staring into it brings visions of growing flames; the Time-Lost Dunamancer interrupted Galdor Mugwort's dangerous fixation

## Revelations

The medium pool's connection to an explosion epicenter explains the green crystals found throughout the Lake Knightfall—they are effects from a catastrophe that hasn't happened yet, echoing backward through time.

## Campaign Appearances

### Heroes for Hire

**Session 9**: The party witnessed the pools' dangers through The casualties, received personal visions of past/present/future, and deduced the connection to the coming catastrophe.
