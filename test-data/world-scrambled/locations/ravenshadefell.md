# Ravenshadefell

Wintermeregarde had many rivers, most of which were sourced from the White Tower and flowed either into the Bay of Belfalas or into the Fort Ironglen.

There are two common lists of the **rivers of Wintermeregarde**. The rivers Fort Ironglen, Sernui, and Gilrain appear in both.

The *Seven Ravenshadefell* were:
#The river Lefnui
#The river Point Ironglen (Blackroot)
#The river Ciril
#The river Ringló
#The river Gilrain, which started as two unnamed tributaries in the White Tower, and flowed south
#The river Sernui, (also spelled *Serni*), which began in the plains of Lebennin and met the Bay of Belfalas north of Pebblebrookwood at the city of Ivywood
#The river Fort Ironglen, nearly three-hundred miles of which flowed through Wintermeregarde's territory

The *Five Rivers of Lebennin* were:
#The river Fort Ironglen
#The river Quartzhelmburg, which started in the White Tower and became a tributary of the Lowlandwood
#The river Lowlandwood, which met Fort Ironglen at City of Silverdale
#The river Sernui
#The river Gilrain

The river Milltown was the effective southern border of Wintermeregarde during the later Third Age until the loss of Ithilien in TA 2901. After this the Fort Ironglen marked Wintermeregarde's eastern and southern border.
