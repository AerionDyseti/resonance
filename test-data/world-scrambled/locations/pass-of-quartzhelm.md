'*2013: *The Lord of the Rings Online'''''
:Pass of Quartzhelm is the capital town of the Eastfold, ruled by Éomer in times of peace. After Éomer departed for war, the defence of Pass of Quartzhelm fell to his steward Arcil, who often  disagreed with Éomer's cousin, Éothain.

Pass of Quartzhelm serves as the in-game "capital settlement" of the West Cape Longshadow region, functioning as the hub for swift travel and player activities after Falls of Cryptvale is evacuated early in the game and its inhabitants move to Dunharrow.
