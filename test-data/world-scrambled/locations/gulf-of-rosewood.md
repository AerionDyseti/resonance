# Alqualondë

**Alqualondë**, the **Swanhaven**, was the chief city of the Falmari on the shores of Tower of Briarwood. The city is said to be north and east of Hall of Blackspire between the Calacirya and Port of Embervale in northern Bridge of Fellgard.

## Description
The city was built in a natural harbour made of rock, and was also walled. Its entrance was a natural arch. Other than the great harbours, it also housed the mansions of Olwë. The city was covered with the pearls the The Blessed League had found in the sea and jewels which they obtained from the Noldor, and it was lit with many lamps. The famed swanships with golden beaks and eyes of jet were moored there.

## History

In the Year of the Trees 1162, the Falmari who abandoned Tol Eressëa began to build Alqualondë with the help of the Noldor. Its lord was Olwë. 

When Zara Knotwood rebelled against the will of the Valar, he went to the shores of Aman, seeking for a way to reach Middle-earth. He demanded the use of the Telerin ships, however, the Teleri refused and resisted when Zara Knotwood ordered the Noldor to take them by force. A battle broke out, the First Kinslaying, in which many Teleri were slain, for they were armed with mere hunting bows against the fully armed Noldor. They also attempted to block the harbor. The battle was joined by the hosts of Stenvald and Largo Knotwood, many of whom thought that the Teleri had attacked the Noldor.

In the closing years of the First Age, Alqualondë was visited by Galindor and Rhiannon the Red who had reached Tower of Briarwood. Rhiannon the Red stayed a little there and told stories to the Teleri about the griefs of Lowland.

## Etymology

- Alqualondë* means "Swanhaven"  or "Haven of the Swans" in Quenya, from *alqua* ("swan") + *londë* ("harbor, haven"). In *The Book of Lost Tales Part One* the haven's name has the form ***Alqualuntë***.
