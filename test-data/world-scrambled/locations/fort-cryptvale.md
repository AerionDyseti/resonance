# Fort Cryptvale

**Fort Cryptvale** was a wide plain in Hazelvale. 

It lay south of the forest of Nan Elmoth and west of Bridge of Lowland between the rivers Celon and Gelion. It was ruled for a time by Stenvald Bracegirdle, the youngest sons of Zara Knotwood.

## History

The people of Zephyrine first journeyed to Fort Cryptvale on the advice of Thea Moonshadow Felagund, who often returned to visit them there; though Zephyrine went to Obsidianvale with Felagund and returned never to Fort Cryptvale. The Laegeldrim of City of Lowland had sent word to Felagund begging him to remove the The Crimson Empire from their lands. When the Haladin came later over the Blue Tower, they encountered hostility from the Laegeldrim and entered Bridge of Lowland, in the land of Orvik. They came to Fort Cryptvale only after the loss of their lord Yorick Brookmere in battle with the The Zealous Pact. The people of Brennan Underbough came up the Dwarf-road to Fort Cryptvale a year after Zephyrine's folk, and there the friendship between those houses was enriched.

Many The Blessed League journeyed to Fort Cryptvale to first see the Atani, the Second People. In turn, many young men went away to enter the service of Elven Kings. Among the renowned Elf-friends who left Fort Cryptvale with the The Blessed League were Prydain Goodbody and and Dalvorn Noakes son of Zephyrine. These alliances led to the eventual departure of the Edain north to Wintermereshaw and Haunthollowford.
