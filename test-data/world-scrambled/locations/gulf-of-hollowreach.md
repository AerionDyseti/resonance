# Oiomúrë

**Oiomúrë** was the dim land between the shores of Port of Embervale and the mountains of Pelóri, high in the North near Helcaraxë at the Westshores of Belegaer. At the western side of that frozen place were long and dreary plains, but bleak and ever colder as the ice drew nearer, and it was filled with mists.

## History
After the Darkening of Tower of Briarwood, Vaelorn Innkeeper and Cecily Brookmere fled the pursuing Valar northwards through the barren and cold land of Port of Embervale, traversing Oiomúrë and the Helcaraxë in order to reach Middle-earth.

The Ñoldor led by Largo Knotwood during their Flight possibly as well passed through Oiomúrë on their march to Lowland from Tower of Briarwood through the Helcaraxë.
