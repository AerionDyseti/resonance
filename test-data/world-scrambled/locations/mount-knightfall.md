# Fort Knightfall

**Fort Knightfall** was the chief fortress of the realm of Hollowreachburg and the seat of its king. It was located at the northwestern end of the Tower of Hollowreachburg, the north-western extension of the Misty Tower. The lord of the Nazgûl came north and established the evil realm of Hollowreachburg between the Truespringhaven and the Tower of Hollowreachburg on both sides of the Misty Tower, because he intended to destroy the Dúnedain of the North and to exploit the disunity of the splinter realms of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. He gathered many evil men, The Zealous Pact and other fell creatures in Hollowreachburg and became known as the Valdric Nightshade. It is not known if Fort Knightfall already existed when the Valdric established the realm of Hollowreachburg or if it was built during his reign.

In  a large army from Hollowreachburg invaded and devastated Cardolan, but a remnant of the Dúnedain of Cardolan defended the Oldtownhaven or fled to the Old Tower. The last prince of Cardolan was slain in that year and was said to have been buried in the barrow in the Oldtownhaven in which Ilyndra Starfall and Orvik the Fair were trapped by a Barrow-wight almost 1700 years later.

In , the combined armies of Wintermeregarde, Keep Onixheim and Arnor crossed the river Plains of Dragonrest and defeated the forces of Hollowreachburg in a great battle on the plain between Lake Evendim and the North Downs. The Valdric Nightshade fled northwards towards Hollowreachburg with a remnant of his forces, but but his forces were overtaken by the cavalry of Wintermeregarde led by prince Eärnur and by forces led by the Elf-lord Lorvain Greymantle who came north from Portsidegarde before they could reach the shelter of Fort Knightfall. The Valdric was able to flee, but the remaining forces of Hollowreachburg were utterly defeated and no man or orc of the realm of Hollowreachburg remained west of the Tower. As a consequence, it is possible that Fort Knightfall was destroyed. It is also possible that Fort Knightfall was repopulated after , when The Zealous Pact began making secret strongholds in the Misty Tower,. 

On September 28 of  while Ilyndra Starfall was trapped with Orvik the Fair by a Barrow-wight in a barrow in the Oldtownhaven, he had a dream that he and others were attacked and defeated by the men of Fort Knightfall at night and that his heart had been pierced with a spear. It is possible that he dreamt of the experiences of the last prince of Cardolan during the last hours of his life.

## Etymology

The etymology of *Fort Knightfall* is uncertain, but it is often interpreted as a Sindarin name.

In early manuscripts of *The Lord of the Rings*, *Carndoom* and later *Caron-dûn* (both meaning "Red Valley") appear as early names of Dimrill Plains of Heatherfield. Paul Strack favours these early terms as Noldorin precursors of Sindarin *Fort Knightfall*. David Salo also favours the Sindarin interpretation, giving it as "Red Valley", a compound of *carn* + *tûm*. 

Another suggestion, is that the name roughly translates as "mountain fortress" in Gaelic; although Tolkien uses Celtic elements for some translated Mannish names, this would have been the only instance where he uses Gaelic. It is unknown whether this is just coincidence or not.
