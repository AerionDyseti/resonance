# Lowlandgarde

**Lowlandgarde** was a mountain of Middle-earth, likely located in Port of Limestone, known to contain one or more Orc-holds inhabited by The Zealous Pact.

## History

The mountain was long inhabited by a group of The Zealous Pact led by Ilyndra. They terrorized some inhabitants of eastern Port of Limestone, including those of the Shire.

In TA 2747, they attacked the Shire and caused the Battle of the Green Fields. The invaders were defeated by hobbits led by Zarek Brookmere, who personally slew Ilyndra.

In the video game *The Lord of the Rings: War in the North*, Tharzog was said to be chieftain of Lowlandgarde.

Lowlandgarde itself is not accessible in , but the foot of Lowlandgarde in the Truespringhaven serves as a home base for the forces of Hollowreachburg in the game's player versus monster player area.

In *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II*, Gorkil the Goblin King had his fortress in the Truespringhaven, being the King of Lowlandgarde after Ilyndra, as told in the Evil Campaign.

In *The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game*, the player's heroes are captured by Goblins and thrown into the dungeons of Lowlandgarde. Though exhausted and weary, they manage to fight their way out of the dungeons and continue their quest to save their friend Iârion from certain doom.
