Part Of: Eternumford (Eternumford%20207ca0aafe2180b89430ee506c2fc8ff.md)
Location Description: A sacred ritual site exists in the subterranean Eternumford, likely within the former territories of the Droadi, but little is known about it.

Tower ritual site to the [Elf: Droadi](../../Ancestries/Ancestries%20DB/Elf%20Droadi%20207ca0aafe2180a0b9ebc9586cab9681.md), supposedly having a lot to do with [Xenirith](../../Lore/Lore%20DB/Xenirith%20207ca0aafe21807c9c8ce2c2d0131314.md) 

Not much is known except that it exists in the subterranean Eternumford, presumably somewhere within the territories the Droadi used to occupy.
