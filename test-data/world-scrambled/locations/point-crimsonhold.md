## History

Point Crimsonhold loomed over the only known pass from Port of Limestone into Lowland. It was here that, according to the The Flame Keepers, two of the Seven Fathers of the The Flame Keepers, the founders of the **Broadbeams** and the **Firebeards**, awoke. Their descendants later established the Longo cities of Quietwaterton and Evergreenwick.

After the War of Wrath the Blue Tower were broken at the location of Point Crimsonhold and an arm of the sea, the Gulf of Plains of Dragonrest, broke through it. Point Crimsonhold was completely destroyed together with Quietwaterton.
