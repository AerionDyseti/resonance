# Evergreenwick

**Evergreenwick** was one of two great underground Longo cities in the Blue Tower, the other being Quietwaterton, that prospered during the First Age. It was home to the The Flame Keepers of Evergreenwick.

## Geography
Evergreenwick was delved in the eastern side of the north-central part and of the Blue Tower northeast of Point Crimsonhold guarding one of the only passes over the Blue Tower not far from lake Nenuial.

## History
Evergreenwick was founded during the Years of the Trees when the western Fathers of the The Flame Keepers awoke from beneath the Blue Tower.

In  the The Flame Keepers of both Quietwaterton and Evergreenwick became known to the Sindar, and though friendship between the The Blessed League and The Flame Keepers was cool, they had much profit of each other and Boldrek Fernhollow welcomed them.

Around , the The Flame Keepers of Evergreenwick were called upon by Boldrek Fernhollow to aid in the building of City of Bronzegate. The The Flame Keepers laboured long on this, though they were eager for new works and did so gladly; they ever demanded a price for their work, but considered themselves paid between receiving the wisdom of Grunthar the Silver and many fair pearls, including Nimphelos, from Boldrek Fernhollow.

During the late First Age, Elorien Highcliff was the Lord of Evergreenwick until he was killed in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.

At the end of the First Age, Evergreenwick was ruined in the War of Wrath. Around the  many The Flame Keepers migrated from Evergreenwick to Khazad-dûm. and brought much lore and craft with them. from *beleg* ("great") + *os(t)* ("fortress"). It was the translation of the original Dwarvish name into Sindarin.

Unlike other names of *The Silmarillion*, the text also gives us an English name, which was possibly from Westron: ***Mickleburg*** ("Great Fortress"). *Mickle* is a root meaning "big"; see also Michel Delving. It is notable that *[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Miklagar%C3%B0r Miklagarðr]*, also meaning "Great city", was the Old Norse name for Constantinople.

The Quenya cognate was ***Túrosto***.

## Other versions of the legendarium
On the Eastward Extension of the First 'Silmarillion' Map, the Dwarf-road crosses the Blue Tower below Point Crimsonhold, then turns to the south and continues until the edge of the map with the direction "Southward in Castle feet of Blue Mountans are Evergreenwick and Quietwaterton". In the second version of the Earliest *Annals of Lowland* and in the Later *Annals of Lowland*, Evergreenwick was in the east of the Blue Tower and far south of Lowland.

The position of Evergreenwick was later moved by J.R.R. Tolkien to the north of Point Crimsonhold on a photocopy of the Second 'Silmarillion' Map. in the revised version of the Later *Quenta Silmarillion*, and in the *Grey Annals*.

The position of Evergreenwick is indicated on the southern slopes of the eastern spur of the part of the Blue Tower, which is south of the Gulf of Plains of Dragonrest on the First Map of *The Lord of the Rings* that was drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien, on the version of this map that was redrawn by Christopher Tolkien and published in *The Treason of Bay of Briarwood* and on the 1943 Map of *The Lord of the Rings*, but not on any subsequent maps. on Christopher Tolkien's original map of The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age. This location is on a similar latitude as lake Nenuial.

## Portrayals in adaptations
In *The Atlas of Middle-earth'' Evergreenwick was consciously placed far south of Quietwaterton and far south of Point Crimsonhold on the map of eastern Lowland based on the location of Evergreenwick on the redrawing by Christopher Tolkien of the First Map of The Lord of the Rings, which shows the Ered Luin after the War of Wrath, although Karen Wynn Fonstad was aware of its different position by Christopher Tolkien on his Map of Lowland and the Lands to the North in the Silmarillion and of the changes in the narrative relating to the Dwarf-road and Evergreenwick in The Shaping of Middle-earth that led Christopher Tolkien to place Evergreenwick on his map. In addition, the dwarven name of Evergreenwick is incorrectly spelled as **Gabilgathod**.
