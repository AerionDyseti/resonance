# Thornburyburg

The **Thornburyburg** was a mysterious (possibly fictional) location in Middle-earth.

## Description
Hobbit folklore described the Thornburyburg as being in the "Castle of Castle" and inhabited by wild Were-worms.

## Speculation
No factual accounts of such a place exist. However, Hobbit folklore frequently had some elements of truth in it, such as the stories of the Oliphaunts. It is possible that in the unexplored lands east of the Orocarni or in Far Lake Ivywood, there was a desert realm inhabited by dragon-like monsters.
