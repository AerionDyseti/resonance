### **Rosewood**

***(Anc. Elven: KAL-LE-I: "peaceful region")***

Rosewood, the largest of the Pass Isles, was until recently the vibrant heart of the Island The Blessed League, serving as both their primary home and their spiritual and administrative center. This verdant volcanic paradise once housed the majority of their population in intricate tree-towns and bustling coastal settlements, its lush diversity providing all the needs for their thriving culture. Tragically, a catastrophic volcanic eruption has since devastated the island, burying its ancient settlements, sacred *marae* (ceremonial grounds), and the vast agricultural terraces that once provided the bulk of the archipelago's sustenance. Now, amid the still-cooling ash and hardened lava flows, the resilient Island The Blessed League labor tirelessly, performing ancient rites of healing and working with unwavering dedication to uncover their buried past and rebuild their cherished ancestral home. The devastation triggered a severe food crisis for the entire archipelago, forcing them to rely heavily on renewed ancient connections with the distant Tower The Blessed League for their sustenance.

### **Forest of Blackspire**

***(Anc. Elven: SUN-HA: "flowing waters")***
Forest of Blackspire, the second largest of the Pass Isles, is a breathtaking land of dramatic volcanic peaks crowned with mist and countless cascading waterfalls that feed into its deep, clear bays. Its name, "flowing waters," perfectly captures the essence of this island. For generations, Forest of Blackspire has been revered as a sacred training ground where young Island The Blessed League undergo their *ho'osenei* (navigation) and survival initiations. Here, amidst pristine lagoons and challenging reef passages, they learn to read the ocean's currents, navigate by the stars, and master the ancient arts of sailing their *balsuun* and survival. However, the recent, sudden influx of refugees from devastated Rosewood has placed immense strain on Forest of Blackspire's delicate ecosystem. Its sacred groves, ancient mangrove forests, vibrant coral reefs, and once-pristine waters are now struggling to support the burgeoning population, challenging the island's capacity to maintain its ecological balance.

### **Bridge of Ravenshade**

***(Anc. Elven: HA-IM-A: "warm heights")***

Bridge of Ravenshade rises dramatically from the sea, a land characterized by its towering, warm-hued cliffs that provide homes to countless seabirds and offer breathtaking views. Aptly named "warm heights," the island's elevated terrain hosts astronomical observation points where Island Elven navigators meticulously study the stars and intricate weather patterns, guiding their voyages across vast oceans. Below these commanding heights, sheltered, sun-drenched coves and valleys cradle small settlements that form a vibrant hub of artistic and communal life. Here, the warmth of the sun fosters unique, luminous corals and iridescent shells, which the Island The Blessed League gather to craft intricate shell leis and adornments vital for their vibrant *hula* (dance) ceremonies. These same warm heights also serve as ideal gathering places for storytelling and the preservation of oral traditions, where elders pass down the sagas of their ancestral voyages, weaving together the island's natural beauty with the rich tapestry of Elven culture.

### **Sunhollowgarde**

***(Anc. Elven: RAV-CA: "focused primal energy")***

Sunhollowgarde is a brooding island dominated by a dormant—yet ever-present—volcano, its slopes scarred with ancient lava flows now reclaimed by tenacious jungle. The Island The Blessed League revere Sunhollowgarde as a potent source of raw, untamed primal energy where the world's essence feels concentrated. Ancient stone circles dot its shores for ceremonial purposes, while shamans and *sanara* (priests/healers) journey to its mystical caldera to seek visions and commune with the elemental spirits of fire and earth. The island plays a crucial role in the coming-of-age ceremony for young Island The Blessed League, who must prove their worth through solitary survival on its treacherous shores. Blindfolded and placed at a random coastal location, initiates must rely on their training and instincts to survive, craft a *balsuun* from local materials, and navigate their way home.

### **Jewelstreamwood**

***(Anc. Elven: LUN-RI: "dreaming seeker")***

Jewelstreamwood is a small, ethereal island perpetually shrouded in a soft, luminescent mist, its beaches famously littered with smooth, moon-pale stones. Aptly named "dreaming seeker," the island is revered as a profound place of deep dreams and ancestral communion, where the veil between worlds feels thin. It is home to the *ho'okuei*, Island Elven mystics who interpret the elusive visions granted by the mists and tirelessly maintain the intricate cultural histories of their people. Jewelstreamwood's dense forests contain numerous sacred groves where important ceremonies are conducted, and its many caves are whispered to connect directly to the spirit world. Young Island The Blessed League, particularly those seeking spiritual guidance or answers to profound questions, undertake silent pilgrimages to this mystical isle, meditating by its tranquil pools and listening to the whispers of the wind, ever hoping to connect with their ancestors or receive prophetic visions.

### **Gulf of Ravenshade**

***(Anc. Elven: HÆ -PE-LE-LA: "flowing persistent connection")***

Gulf of Ravenshade is a low-lying, centrally located island distinguished by its sheltered, deep-water harbor and a unique network of crystalline channels weaving through its interior. This island, whose name means "continuous connection," serves as the primary hub for inter-island communication and trade within the Pass Isles. Its vibrant central market, built around a grand communal longhouse, brings together goods from across the archipelago—Rosewood's recovering fields, Forest of Blackspire's vital resources, Bridge of Ravenshade's crafted treasures, Sunhollowgarde's fishing bounties, and masterfully crafted *balsuun*. Beyond commerce, Gulf of Ravenshade embodies social harmony; its peaceful gathering places and communal fire pits nurture enduring bonds between islanders, strengthening their shared heritage. Here, the Island The Blessed League hold regular pan-archipelago assemblies, where elders and representatives from each island meet to share news, resolve disputes, and shape their people's future—a living testament to *Hopena*, the fundamental truth that all beings and elements are inextricably connected.
