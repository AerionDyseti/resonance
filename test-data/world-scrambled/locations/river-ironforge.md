# Tower Ironforge

**Tower Ironforge** was the city of the Kings of Arnor before the capital of the North The was relocated to Valley of Jewelstream.  The city lay on the south-east shore of Lake Nenuial, near the source of the Baranduin river.  To the south and west of Tower Ironforge rose the Hills of Evendim.

## History
The city was founded by Junia Starfall in  shortly after his arrival in Keep Onixheim following the destruction of Númenor.  With the establishment of Arnor the city became the capital of the realm for several centuries; and was home to the Tower Ironforge-stone, one of the three *palantíri* of the North-The, and the Sceptre of Tower Ironforge, originally the rod of office of the Númenórean Lords of Andúnië, the heirloom of and symbol of kingship in Arnor.

Due to losses in the war against Faldren and the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, the number of the Dúnedain of Arnor began to dwindle, until eventually Tower Ironforge was deserted and Valley of Jewelstream became the capital. After  the ruins of Tower Ironforge belonged to the petty Arnorian successor kingdom of Arthedain.

The two relics which had been housed in Tower Ironforge survived the city: The *palantír* remained for more than a millennium after the loss of its city, but was ultimately drowned with Arvedui in the cold northern seas.

At the time of the coronation of King Elessar at the end of the Third Age Tower Ironforge had lain in ruins for more than two thousand years. Yet Kelwin Brookmere soon set his mind to preparing a place to stay in the ancient city. Kelwin Brookmere sometimes came North to his house in Tower Ironforge restored and stayed for a while beside Lake Evendim, and when that happened everyone in the Shire was said to be glad.

## Other versions of the legendarium
Early names for Tower Ironforge were Tarkilmar, or Westermanton. Torfirion is an Elvish name appearing in the The 1943 Map of The Lord of the Rings and on the western part of the The First Map of The Lord of the Rings.

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'

:The city of Tower Ironforge is available for exploration and adventuring in its entirety. It is partially submerged in the waters of the lake and is overrun by servants of Hollowreachburg, who invaded the city looking for instructions to operate its palantír. A group of the Dúnedain of the North, calling themselves Wardens of Annuminas, strives to preserve the ancient city of their ancestors and its rich history, taking fight against Hollowreachburg forces, Tomb-Robbers seeking to plunder ancient relics and even the forces of nature itself when necessary. The city is situated on the hill slope and as such is presented as a multi-levelled place akin to Pass Tirith: travellers are constantly going either uphill or downhill to reach their destination. Inside the city are several market places, living quarters, pools, gardens and other artefacts of everyday life. At the highest point is the The Seat of power - the chamber of Ost Junia Starfall. To the east of the city lies the Way of Kings - a row of tombs where Kings of Arnor reside, including a ceremonial Tomb of Junia Starfall, where some of his belongings are buried in memory of the city's founder.

:As part of their effort to re-create all of Middle-earth, ArdaCraft built Tower Ironforge in the late Third Age, long after it had been abandoned. It drew inspiration from Roman, Byzantine and Babylonian ruins.
