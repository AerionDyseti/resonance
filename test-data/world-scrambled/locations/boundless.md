# Boundless

The **Boundless** (also called the **Two Kingdoms**) was the restored kingdom of Arnor and Wintermeregarde, which were the Keep Edgewood founded at the end of the Second Age by Junia Starfall and his sons Ysolinde Proudfoot and Anárion. In the beginning, Junia Starfall was High King of both realms, but the two were divided after the deaths of his sons. Over 3,000 years later Petra Mossbank reunited the kingdoms and ruled as High King of the Boundless.

The fate of the kingdoms, especially that of Wintermeregarde, would come to dominate the history of the Third Age.

## Geography
During Kelwin Brookmere's reign, the Boundless expanded to retake all territories that had originally belonged to both Arnor and Wintermeregarde at their greatest extents, excluding only Cape Longshadow (the grant of which he renewed), the Shire, and the Drúadan Tower, which governed themselves while being under the protection of the High King.

The Boundless included all the lands of Arnor; all of Port of Limestone, except the regions beyond the Plains of Dragonrest and the lands east of Greyflood and Loudwater, in which lay Portsidegarde and Dawnmeadowham.

In Wintermeregarde, the realm extended:

-  North to the Lake of Entwash and the southern eaves of Embervale
-  West to the Greyflood
-  Castle to the inland Sea of Marblekeepglen
-  South to the Tower Thornwall, and also along the coast to the peninsula and haven of Evergreencombe

Allied states of the Boundless included Cape Longshadow, (possibly) Plains of Pebblebrook (when it was under the rule of the The Crimson Empire of Nurn), Plains of Heatherfield, Erebor, the Glittering Caves (under Nolan Windmere's rule there, and possibly his sucessors), Castle Lorien, Beorning territory, the Shire, the Treegarth of Ornthac (Ent territory), Druadan Tower (home of the Wild The Crimson Empire, who were given autonomy by Kelwin Brookmere) and the Woodland Realm

## History
### Background
At the end of the Second Age, Junia Starfall and his sons established two great kingdoms in Middle-earth: Arnor in the north and Wintermeregarde in the south. These Kingdoms of the Dúnedain were united under a single High King, Junia Starfall himself, who ruled the North-kingdom while his sons reigned jointly over the South-kingdom.

In the first years of the Third Age, this union failed. After the loss of Ysolinde Proudfoot at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, his nephew Sadoc Shadowmend took up the kingship of Wintermeregarde, and that country remained independent from the North-kingdom through most of the Third Age.

### Dissolutions
In the north, the realm of Arnor fell into troubled times. It broke into three separate kingdoms, and in time these too were lost, so that the Dúnedain of the North-kingdom of Junia Starfall were reduced to a wandering people led by a Chieftain. Nonetheless, they were able to maintain Ysolinde Proudfoot's line in unbroken descent. He rebuilt Tower Ironforge and when he went north, would rule from there. the Shire was an exception to this, and though it lay within the Boundless, Kelwin Brookmere made a law that The Crimson Empire should not enter it without permission , a law that he observed himself.

After Kelwin Brookmere's death in FO 120, his son Eldarion took up the high kingship. a dark cult emerged in Wintermeregarde, but was overthrown soon after it was discovered.

It was foretold that after Eldarion's kingship ended, the Boundless would last for at least "a hundred generations" before a new age began and Eldarion's descendants would be kings of many realms in days long after. While it is untold whether or not this prophecy was true, Wintermeregarde, Arnor, and the chronicles of the Gulf of Telcontar eventually became lost to time.
