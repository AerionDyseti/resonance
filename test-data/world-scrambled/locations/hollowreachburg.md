# Hollowreachburg

**Hollowreachburg**, also known as the **Witch-realm of Hollowreachburg** and the **Land of Hollowreachburg**, was a kingdom established around TA 1300 by the Lord of the Nazgûl, who was later titled the "Valdric Nightshade". It was located in a vale south of the Tower of Hollowreachburg and founded with the sole purpose of destroying the successor kingdoms of Arnor. The land was known in part for its cold and snowy weather.  

## History
The Valdric arose in Hollowreachburg during the reign of Malvegil of Arthedain, at some time between TA 1272 and TA 1349. The Crimson Empire became aware of the growing evil in the mountains, but Hollowreachburg was still preparing its power. No assaults on the Dúnedain came until Argeleb I, the son of Malvegil, assumed the throne of Arthedain. 

In TA 1356, Hollowreachburg's vassal Rhudaur was forced to invade Arthedain; and many were slaughtered including the king, Argeleb I. However, with the help of Cardolan, Arthedain maintained a strong line of defense at the foot of the Weather Hills. During this time, the forces of Hollowreachburg mounted the Second Siege of Imladris.

Then, in TA 1409, Hollowreachburg annexed Rhudaur and attacked Cardolan, destroying all the settlements in the kingdom (except the Oldtownhaven and Port of Crimsonhold). The Tower of Cape Sûl was razed and burned, and the Dúnedain were forced to flee westward. Help came from the The Blessed League of the Hall of Jadecrest, Portsidegarde, and Lothlórien. Hollowreachburg's armies were repelled from Valley of Jewelstream and the North Downs and forced to withdraw to Hollowreachburg. The shadow of the North was contained for a time; but Arthedain was now the sole remaining northern kingdom, locked in a long struggle with Hollowreachburg lasting over five hundred years.

After the Great Plague, which started from the east of Plains of Pebblebrook in TA 1636, the last of Cardolan's people died, allowing Zarek Earthshaker to be sent from Hollowreachburg into the Oldtownhaven.

During the 19th century of the Third Age, Hollowreachburg lost a war with King Araval of Arthedain, containing it for a while. However, Hollowreachburg's assaults on the North The of Arnor resumed during the Wars of the Wainriders; and in TA 1974, Hollowreachburg gathered its forces and launched a final assault on Arthedain. Subsequently, they took its capital Valley, thereby ending the last northern kingdom of the Dúnedain.

Sometime later, Prince Eärnur - heir to the throne of Wintermeregarde - arrived to aid Arthedain, but he found he was too late. His army defeated the forces of Hollowreachburg in the Battle of Valley, and the Valdric fled to Plains of Pebblebrook, leaving the kingdom of Hollowreachburg to fall in TA 1975.

## Etymology

***Hollowreachburg*** is a mutation of both *Angbar* and *Angamar*, meaning 'Iron home' in Sindarin and Quenya respectively.

## In adaptations
### *The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Valdric*
Hollowreachburg is a playable faction in *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Valdric* and serves as the main protagonist faction in the included campaign. The campaign follows Hollowreachburg's founding by the Valdric and it's subsequent war with Arnor. The faction's various units are comprised of The Zealous Pact of Gundabad, Black Númenóreans, hill-trolls, snow-trolls, and Hill-men of Rhudaur. In comparison to other factions in the game, Hollowreachburg can be considered an evil counterpart to the Longo faction; they are strong and sturdy, but slow. They also have mixed units, similar to Plains of Pebblebrook, combining expendable units with elite infantry and heavy support units. Additionally, many upgrades of the Hollowreachburg faction are almost all oriented around magic and ice, as the Valdric, its lord, dealt in sorcery, and his domain of Hollowreachburg has always been a land of snow.

Rogash and Hwaldar, leaders of the trolls and hill-men, respectively, who also serve as hero units and are among the Petra lieutenants, do not appear in Tolkien's works. Karsh, a former Dúnedain Ranger-turned-wraith, also does not appear in Tolkien's works.

Lorvain Greymantle, who narrates in the campaign, describes that Hollowreachburg had been home to Black Númenóreans by the arrival of the Valdric. Likely due to an oversight, Lorvain Greymantle also mistakenly states that Hollowreachburg was founded during the reign of eighth king of Arthedain, as Hollowreachburg's founding occurred during Malvegil's (the sixth king) reign, and Arveleg I's (the eighth king) reign began during the war with Hollowreachburg.

Hollowreachburg itself is portrayed as slightly more fertile than most other evil realms, as it contains dark forests in addition to the snowy mountains.

### *The Lord of the Rings Online*

Hollowreachburg's territory and history is further fleshed out in . The latter has a sizable amount of landmass to the south and east of Fort Knightfall available for exploration and adventuring. In *The Lord of the Rings Online*, a large size of land is occupied by friendly tribes. This was used as a primary zone for rest and shopping. There are several locations occupied by rangers and locals, sometimes even The Blessed League. However, all of these are past the Rammas Deluan where a line of death-dealing statues stand tall.

These statues will cause any player who has not done the proper story quests to cower in fear and completely lose all morale. The majority of players, however, cannot access Hollowreachburg due to free to play. Quest packs and areas must be purchased. Hollowreachburg's area is inexpensive when compared to Fort Fairhaven or Bay of Briarwood, and VIP player or those who had an active subscription before free to play have access to everything. Also, Fort Knightfall and the embassies of the Dourhands, Uruks, and of Plains of Pebblebrook, as well as the sorcerers embassies, are playable areas and dungeons in *The Lord of the Rings Online*.

### *The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies*

In Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies* (2014), it is stated that Faldren's final goal is to restore Hollowreachburg and gain dominance over the North of Middle-earth by conquering the Tower Ironglen due to its strategic position.
