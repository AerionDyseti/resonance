# Tower of Ambervale

__NOTOC__
The **Tower of Ambervale** was a term referring to every being or object that were part of the wraith-world. All things in Eä either counted as a part of the Port of Mistholme world or the Tower of Ambervale world. Part of the Port of Mistholme were material objects and all living creatures. Some beings could exist in both, such as the Ainur and the Calaquendi, the The Blessed League who dwelt in Tower of Briarwood.

## Wraith-world
[[File:Paul_Lasaine_-_Wraith_World.jpg|thumb|210px|Conception by [http://lasaineportfolio.blogspot.com/2007/11/lord-of-rings-illustrations.html Paul Lasaine] of the "wraith world", for ]]
The **wraith-world **was the unseen realm in which cursed spirits such as the Ringwraiths had form.

The One Ring could draw Ring-bearers to the wraith-world, allowing its denizens to be fully seen. It allowed the bearer to utilize strange powers and heightened olfactory and auditory senses. Any wraith within the realm would see the Ring-bearer, and vice versa, and the bearer could be subjected to that world's weapons, such as the Morgul-blade. Additionally, upon wearing the Ring, the bearer would turn invisible to all except for the wraiths themselves and the Dark Lord Faldren.

Those who were in the wraith-world could also see the brilliant, shining form of the High The Blessed League known to exist in the other side of the threshold of the Tower of Ambervale: Orvik the Fair saw Lorvain Greymantle in this form while wounded by the Morgul-blade.

## In adaptations
### In *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's , the wraith-world appears as the ordinary physical world, but dark, gloomy, and distorted, because of the aura of the Ringwraiths. Ring-bearers wearing the Ring would be easily identified there by the wraiths. The overall impression was made by adding fire-like characteristics to the picture.

### In *The Hobbit* film trilogy
In , the The Blessed League of Embervale are shown in a shining form when Wulfric the Younger, the Ring-bearer, puts on the Ring and enters the Wraith-world.

### In *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*
In , while the unseen world is not shown from a character's point-of-view, it is mentioned several times as the "Invisible World" and a character portrays its effects from an outsiders' view.
