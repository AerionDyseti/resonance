Location Description: The entrance to the Fungal Heart features unnaturally clean stone walls, maintained through powerful cleansing magic. Subtle marks on the stone may indicate hidden runes, suggesting a protective barrier that prevents fungal spread while containing whatever lies within. Beyond this sterile zone, a stark contrast reveals walls covered in strange growths and spores, creating an unsettling threshold between cleanliness and corruption.

As you approach what your map indicates should be the entrance to the Fungal Heart, you find yourself facing a stretch of unnaturally clean stone walls. Too clean. Where surrounding passages show signs of age and wear, this section appears meticulously maintained, scrubbed free of even the smallest speck of moss or mold. The stone itself seems to shimmer with a faint silvery sheen - evidence of powerful cleansing magic. At first glance, it appears to be nothing more than a dead end.

Upon closer inspection, barely visible amongst the gleaming stone, you notice a series of tiny marks that might be easily dismissed as natural imperfections. To most eyes, they would appear as nothing more than scratches, but those familiar with Thieves' Cant might recognize them as cleverly disguised runes. The marks are arranged in an unusual pattern, suggesting they might be more than simple vandalism. The air here carries a sharp, antiseptic scent that burns slightly in your nostrils, and the overwhelming cleanliness of the area makes it clear that significant effort has been made to eliminate any trace of fungal growth.

<aside>
A successful DC 15 Arcana check reveals that the cleansing barrier serves a dual purpose - while it prevents fungal spread outward, it also contains whatever lies within, like a magical quarantine.

Through the archway, you can make out the beginning of a passage where the sterile zone abruptly ends. Beyond that line, the corruption is immediately visible - walls slick with strange growths, and air thick with spores that dance in any light that reaches them.

> The contrast between the magically maintained cleanliness and the overwhelming fungal corruption beyond creates an unsettling threshold - like staring through a window into a contained plague.
