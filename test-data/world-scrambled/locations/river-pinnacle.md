# Tower Pinnacle

The **Tower Pinnacle** (or the **Tower of Orvik the Elder**) was the wasteland around the Tower Ironglen and Plains of Heatherfield, charred and blackened by the burning breath of Orvik the Elder the Dragon. The borders of the Tower harboured a little clinging greenery and life, but its heart was scorched and utterly barren. The desolate lands extended southwards some miles along the banks of the Keep Lowland from Orvik the Elder's lair beneath the Tower Ironglen, but the lands to the north of the mountain seem to have suffered even more fiercely. After Orvik the Elder's death, it seems that the Tower was slowly reclaimed, so that both Erebor and Plains of Heatherfield were eventually to recover from their destruction and prosper once again.
