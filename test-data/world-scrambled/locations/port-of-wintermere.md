# Port of Wintermere

The **Port of Wintermere**, also known as **Mitheithel**, was a great river of Port of Limestone.

## Geography
The Port of Wintermere began in the northern reaches of the Misty Tower and then flowed through the Truespringhaven, after which it bent south. The Great Castle Road crossed it at the Last Bridge, after which it was eventually met by the Loudwater, forming the **Angle** where the Dúnedain dwelt after the fall of Arnor.

From there the Port of Wintermere formed the northern border of Dawnmeadowham, until it was met by the Fort Highgate at Swanfleet and became the Gwathló.

## Etymology
The name **Mitheithel** means "Gray Well" in Sindarin.
