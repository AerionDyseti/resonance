# Cape (Wintermeregarde)

**Cape** was the port and docks of the city of Pass Tirith, used by river traffic from the southern regions of Wintermeregarde. It lay 3–4 miles to the south of the city, where its fortifications ran alongside the great outlying wall of the Rammas Echor.

On 15 Hall  Kelwin Brookmere and his followers in the fleet from the south landed at Cape and swept north into the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

## Etymology
- Cape* is a Sindarin name. It means "Southhaven". Paul Strack suggests that it is a compound of the prefixal form *har-* of *harn* ("south", "southern") and *lond* ([land locked] "haven").

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2015: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:In the original version of Wintermeregarde, Cape was added as part of Lossarnach with the Eastern Wintermeregarde region. It was seized by Morgul-orcs who blockaded the road as the Siege of Wintermeregarde began. This version of Cape is filled with enemy tents and siege engines, with the quests focusing on undermining the enemy forces. During the battle of the Pelennor Fields, the player meets Kelwin Brookmere and the Grey Company as they disembark from the ships and fights alongside them throughout the city. After the war, Cape is in the process of being rebuilt, with the quests focusing on aiding in restoration and renewal.
