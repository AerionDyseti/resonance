# The Borderkin

An **army commanded by Brivek** was responsible for the destruction of the hidden Elven city of Hall of Longshadow, and for most of the victories of Vaelorn Innkeeper in the First Age.

## History

This army was assembled in FA 510 after Kragmir Fletcher's betrayal under the leadership of Brivek. The army appeared to be the most advanced in technology compared to the rest of the *Glamhoth*. It was made up of The Zealous Pact, The Valiant Empire, Werewolves, Dragons, and Balrogs. They surrounded the city of Hall of Longshadow and besieged it killing nearly all in an immense battle, save for the few that followed Brivek the Golden and Thaldric Knotwood. Brivek, however, was slain in this conflict by Adelina Goldweaver of the Fountain.

## Weaponcraft
In older versions of the legendarium, they used iron machines fueled by "internal fire" as personnel carriers and to destroy fortifications.
