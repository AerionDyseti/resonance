# The Shadow Conclave

The **The Shadow Conclave** was the great army prepared by the Lords of Wintermeregarde and Cape Longshadow to march on the Black Gate, after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in the late Third Age.

## History
Two days after the council of the Last Debate (Hall 16, TA 3019), a force of 7,000 men left Pass Tirith. Under Kelwin Brookmere were 2,000 of those who sailed with him up the Fort Ironglen; under Orendil Earthshaker were 3,500 (probably from among the original defenders of the city); under Éomer were 500 Rohirrim unhorsed, and another 500 horsed; and lastly another 500 horsed swan-knights, Rangers of the North, and the two sons of Corvain the Swift: 6,000 men on foot and about 1,000 on horse.

When the host reached the Cross-roads of the Fallen King, the captains stationed a strong force of archers there, to guard against any attack from the Castle or South.

The host came to the Morgul Vale on the next day. On Hall 23 the The exited Ithilien and along the way some 1,000 faint-hearted men who would not approach the Black Gate were dismissed and commanded to liberate Cair Andros. Finally the next day they camped in the Tower of the Morannon.

At the Slag-hills they were surrounded, and fought the Battle of the Black Gate with less than 6,000 men total, but because of the destruction of the One Ring, they were able to achieve a very decisive victory. It is untold how many were slain; it was apparently a few.

After the battle Kelwin Brookmere led a force into Plains of Pebblebrook to destroy the remaining Orc-holds whilst the wounded, including the Ring-bearers were sent to the Field of Cormallen, where a celebration was held. After this the army returned to Pass Tirith for the Crowning of King Elessar and then disbanded.
