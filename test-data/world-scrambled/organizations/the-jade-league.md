# The Jade League

The **The Jade League** was an army assembled by Lysander Shepherd Starfall, the King of Hall of Longshadow for the fifth greatest battle against Vaelorn Innkeeper, and the only time Hall of Longshadow ever participated in any of the great battles of the First Age.

## History

When Lysander Shepherd Starfall had heard of a great mustering against the Dark Lord, he brought forth an army of ten thousand Gondolindrim. Until the main part of the battle started, the host guarded the Pass of Sirion before marching forth at the start of the battle and for the most part, the king was able to restrain most of his people from the rash onslaught started by Norvald Quarrystone. Then the host of Lysander Shepherd Starfall threw itself into the battle joining the ranks of the western host coming to the aid of Stenvald, and together they battled the enemy on the wastes of Anfauglith.

However, the enemy proved too powerful and the host was cast aside and the battle lost. The host survived with help of the The Crimson Empire of the Gulf of Katarina Puddifoot led by Faldren the Bold and Tobias Puddifoot, and they were able to kept the enemy from breaking through the Pass Sirion. Then Lysander Shepherd Starfall, listening to the council of Faldren the Bold and Tobias Puddifoot was persuaded to return to Hall of Longshadow. Battling its way south and covered by the valiant rearguard of the Katarina Puddifoot, the host escaped back to Hall of Longshadow through the Encircling Tower at the expense of the Katarina Puddifoot who all perished in the Fen of Serech save for Faldren the Bold.
