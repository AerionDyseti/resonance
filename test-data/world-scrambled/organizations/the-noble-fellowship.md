## Overview

The The Noble Fellowship was a multinational alliance of armies from across Goldleafgarde, united under the leadership of the previous generation of dragonmarked heroes during the **Darkness Wars**. Their symbol—a modified version of Sol's holy symbol—marked their armor, equipment, and documents.

## Formation

When the Darkness Wars threatened to consume Goldleafgarde, the dragonmarked heroes of that era rallied disparate nations and peoples to stand together against the encroaching shadow. Their supernatural abilities and heroic reputations allowed them to inspire and coordinate forces that would otherwise never have fought side by side.

## Symbol

The The used a modified symbol of Sol as their identifying mark. This symbol has been found on:

- The armor of fallen The soldiers in the ancient cistern
- A journal recovered from the oasis dungeon
- A +1 quickdraw shield recovered by the Keys to Perfection party

## Legacy

The The achieved victory in the Darkness Wars, though the cost was immense. Many of their soldiers—like the Hyrian warriors found in the ancient cistern—never returned home. Their equipment and remains are occasionally discovered in locations where battles were fought or where soldiers fell during missions.

## Current Status

The The disbanded after the Darkness Wars ended. However, their symbol and legacy endure, and artifacts bearing their mark continue to surface across Goldleafgarde.

## Known Members

- The dragonmarked heroes of the previous generation (specific names unknown)
- Hyrian soldiers, including Hinandyr barbarians
- Forces from multiple nations across Goldleafgarde

## Encounters

The Keys to Perfection party discovered The remains and equipment in the ancient cistern beneath the Mistholmemere oasis, including two Hyrian warriors who had been on a mission to transport a powerful (now cursed) spear.
