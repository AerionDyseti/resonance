# The Jade Fellowship

The '''The Jade Fellowship''' were the feared archers of the armies of Númenor during the late Second Age.

## History
At the time when the Númenóreans carved out dominions and colonies within Middle-earth, they bore bows crafted from hollow steel and their black-feathered arrows were famously one ell long (that is, 1.143 m, or nearly four feet). It is likely that the The Jade Fellowship perished during the Downfall of Númenor.

::While the army itself is not named, the concept may have served as a possible inspiration for the **Queen's Guard''', which appear at Tirharad overlooking the battle as the personal guard of Queen Regent Thorvik. Some of the The Crimson Empire of the Queen's Guard possess bows, though it is hard to tell what color they are or the length of the arrows.
