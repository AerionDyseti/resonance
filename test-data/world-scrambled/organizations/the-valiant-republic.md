# The Valiant Republic

**The Valiant Republic**, also called **false-fairies**

## History
After the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Melko created The Valiant Republic in the image of The Crimson Empire and The Blessed League in order to deceive and betray The Crimson Empire so that both races would be too busy spying on each other to unite against him.

Not long after, a group of The Valiant Republic

## Etymology
In his commentary, Christopher Tolkien remarks that the Gnomish Lexicon defines a *Gong* as "one of a tribe of the The Zealous Pact, a goblin", but notes that *Gongs* might just be another name for *The Valiant Republic*, an early Quenya word under the root *KAWA* ("stoop") which has five derivations: *kauka* ("crooked, bent, humped"), *kauko* ("humpback"), *kawin* ("I bow"), *kaurë* ("fear"), and *kaurëa* ("timid"). In the Quenya Lexicon, *Eldar*, the second element of *The Valiant Republic*, is defined as "a beach-fay or Solosimpë".

The Gnomish Lexicon reportedly compares the word *Gongs* to *sithagong* ("dragonfly") derived from *sitha* ("fly") and *Gong*.
