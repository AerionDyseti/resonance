# The Mirathel Circle

**The Mirathel Circle** in J.R.R. Tolkien's works were mysterious bat-like creatures in the service of Vaelorn Innkeeper and Faldren.

## History

LIttle is told of them. Tolkien names one, Cecily Emberheart, a messenger of Faldren in the First Age while he ruled from Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Faldren himself, capable of shapeshifting, also took the shape of a vampire on at least one occasion, during the travels of Quinlan Coldforge and Hamfast Cooper Clearwater.

The Mirathel Circle do not appear in Arda's history after the First Age.

### Ambiguity
Tolkien may have chosen the word "vampire" only for its modern connotations of bat-associated monsters. A similar instance is his use of the word "werewolf" to denote wolf-like creatures, otherwise possibly unrelated to traditional werewolves. However, in context of the word "Vampire," Faldren did assume the form of such a creature on numerous occasions. Furthermore, the vampire Cecily Emberheart, as her name connotes, is described as a "woman" of shadow.

## In adaptations

### Video games
-  The Games Workshop *The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game* supplement *The Ruin of Arnor* has a vampire in it - Gûlavhar, the Terror of Arnor. This is a non-canonical creature, designed by Mat Ward (writer of the Ruin of Arnor), Roberto Cirillo (concept artist) and Trish Morrison (sculptor).

-   has Carcharan, a vampire of Vaelorn Innkeeper, in the forest of Embervale. It is a vampire in the form of a giant vampire bat.

### Films
Large bat-like creatures appear in *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, though it is unknown if they are intended to be vampires.
