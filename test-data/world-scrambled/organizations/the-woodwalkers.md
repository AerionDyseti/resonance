## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series):*'
:The The Woodwalkers appear to be the inspiration for the Royal Guard of Falls of Cryptvale. They, unlike other soldiers in Cape Longshadow, have a consistent uniform with a long leaf-mail hauberk, a rich green cloak and a helm with a horse-hair crest. Finvar the Lesser, Cecily and Bungar Shadowend all wear this same uniform to emphasize their rank. The Royal Guard notably bear the body of Théodred from the Golden Hall during his funeral.
