# The Fallen Alliance

Type: Monstrous
Influence: Local/Regional
Relationship to Party: Friendly

## Overview

A vast fungal collective intelligence dwelling in the depths beneath Vrasillex. The Myconids communicate through rapport spores and operate as a single distributed consciousness where individual bodies are temporary vessels.

## Nature

The The Fallen Alliance doesn't think in terms of individuals. Bodies are temporary, the collective endures. This fundamental difference in psychology made communication with the individual-minded Dro'adi nearly impossible—until the party intervened.

## Goals

- **Survival**: The coming catastrophe (the green star impact) threatens to destroy the The kingdom
- **Warning**: Desperately trying to communicate the danger to the Dro'adi
- **Alliance**: Seeking intermediaries who can bridge the communication gap

## Communication

Myconids communicate through rapport spores—a direct mind-to-mind sharing of thoughts and sensations. To them, this is simply talking. To individual-minded beings, it feels like psychic assault.

## Notable Individuals Encountered

### "The Brutes" (Three Guardians)

Three large The guardians who protected the emissary during the delegation encounter. Positioned defensively but did not attack when Brienna the Golden approached.

### "The Little One" (Emissary)

A small The who served as the delegation's communicator. Dropped a bundle of fresh healing mushrooms as a gift before releasing rapport spores. Delivered the crucial message: "It will kill us all. Please, help us."

### The Feelers (Deceased)

Bay Myconids who died attempting to cross the Time Pools:

- One was consumed by the green pool (bubbled and boiled)
- One fell into the medium pool and emerged as two identical copies, shredded and burned as if caught at the center of a massive explosion
- The remaining two fled

These deaths revealed the terrible truth about the medium pool's connection to the future catastrophe.

## The Tragic Miscommunication

Weeks of The "raids" on Vrasillex were actually desperate diplomatic missions. The Myconids didn't understand they were killing individuals when their rapport spores overwhelmed Dro'adi minds—to them, they were simply trying to share information. Each violent response was met with confusion and more attempts at communication.

## Campaign Appearances

### Heroes for Hire

**Session 9**: The party encountered a The delegation beyond the Time Pools and established first peaceful contact. Brienna the Golden breathed the rapport spores and received their desperate plea for help.
