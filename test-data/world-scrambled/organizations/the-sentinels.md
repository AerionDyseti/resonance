# The Sentinels

Type: Religious
Influence: Universal
Relationship to Party: Neutral

The **The Sentinels** is one of three patron pantheons that shaped the mortal races of Goldleafgarde. Drawing inspiration from **Xenirith**, the destroyed Trinity member representing Reclamation, these gods embody the principles of natural cycles, entropy, and renewal.

## Member Deities

- **Kalvarakt (The Unbroken)** - Patron of The Zealous Pact
- **Malor (The Fang)** - Patron of Urbara

## Divine Philosophy

The pantheon represents natural cycles, necessary endings, entropy and renewal - creating their races in the secret, wild places as the last arrivals.
