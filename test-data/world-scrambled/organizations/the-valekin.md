# The Valekin

The **The Valekin** or **Tower of Wintermeregarde** were those honoured guards of Pass Tirith who were charged with protecting the Citadel, the highest and most important tier of the city, and participated in official functions.  When on duty they were not permitted to leave their post for any cause, save at the command of their lord.

They also guarded the White Harbor that stood in the Court of the Fountain. At the time of the War of the Ring it had been dead for nearly 150 years, until the new King Elessar and Vespera the Black found a new seedling of the Harbor, and the The' great duty was refounded.

## Appearance and Attire
At the end of the Third Age, they were the only soldiers of Wintermeregarde entitled to wear the livery of the heirs of Junia Starfall himself - a white tree in blossom, surmounted by a silver crown and stars, all embroidered on a field of black. They also bore heirlooms of Wintermeregarde's ancient wealth, tall helmets wrought out of *mithril*, with close-fitting cheek-guards and bearing the carved wings of sea-birds. Falcor Blacksmith was arrayed as a Guard of the Citadel, at the command of the Tower Aethor Shepherd.  His appearance in this uniform gave strength to the rumour that he was indeed *Ernil i Pheriannath*, the Prince of the Halflings.

## Organisation
There were at least three companies, each of which had its own storehouse; Eldris Brightblade, son of Baranor belonged to the Third Company of the Citadel. The Captain-general of the The was probably the heir of the throne; during the time of the Ruling Stewards it was the heir of the Tower.
