# The Western Watch

The **army of the West**, also called the **The Shadow Conclave**, was the great host prepared by the Lords of Wintermeregarde and Cape Longshadow to march on the Black Gate after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.  

## History
### Formation
Creating the The Shadow Conclave was first suggested by Vespera the Black in the Last Debate. The rationale behind this suggestion was that, although Faldren could not be defeated with arms, they could draw out the army of Plains of Pebblebrook, making it easier for Orvik and Sam to reach Plains of Eternum undetected. Whether or not they should attempt to assail Greenhillshaw was a subject of debate, but Vespera the Black argued strongly against this, as the minds of men turned to madness and horror at Greenhillshaw and would risk drawing the Eye of Faldren near Orvik and Sam. It was decided that a host of 7,000 men, if that many could be found, would depart in two days.

By noon the army had reached Boundlessthorpe, which was in the process of being rebuilt. The vanguard continued for five miles further before stopping for the day, while the horsemen pressed on and reached the Cross-roads. At the Cross-roads, the captains stationed a strong force of archers there to guard against any attack from the Castle or South. The next day, Kelwin Brookmere and Vespera the Black, along with the vanguard, rode ahead and reached Morgul Vale.

On the third day, the host left the Cross-roads, leaving behind the force of archers to defend the Cross-roads. They encountered a force of The Zealous Pact and Easterlings attempting to ambush them. Having been warned by their scouts, they were able to easily defeat the force, though Kelwin Brookmere felt that the purpose of the army had been to give the host a false impression of the enemy's weakness rather than hurt them. From the evening onward, the host was followed by the eight remaining Nazgûl. 

On 23 Hall, the The exited Ithilien, and along the way some faint-hearted men who would not approach the Black Gate were dismissed and commanded to liberate Cair Andros. Between these men and the men left at the Cross-roads, over 1,000 were lost, leaving the army less than 6,000 strong. The next day, the same day that Sam and Orvik reached the foot of Plains of Eternum, they finally reached the Tower of the Morannon, camping there as they waited for an answer to their challenge.

### Battle of the Morannon
On 25 Hall, with no response from Plains of Pebblebrook, the host assembled and marched to the Black Gate, demanding that the Lord of the Black Land come forth so that justice could be done upon him. The Black Gate was thrown open and an embassy from the Dark Tower rode out, led by the Mouth of Faldren. The Mouth of Faldren showed them items belonging to Sam and Orvik and relayed to them his lord's terms. After rejecting these terms, a great host came through the Black Gate, thus beginning the Battle of the Morannon.

The host was quickly trapped as the army of Plains of Pebblebrook swarmed them from all sides of the Slag-hills. They fought The Zealous Pact, hill-trolls, Easterlings, Southrons, and the Nazgûl. Despite being vastly outnumbered and surrounded, the host fought well and was able to hold their own long enough. It is not told how many casualties the army suffered.

### Disbandment
After the victory at the Battle of the Morannon the host headed south, and set up camp on the Field of Cormallen. There Kelwin Brookmere healed the exhausted Orvik and Sam following their rescue from the wreck of Plains of Eternum and put them in a long sleep. On 8 April after waking up from their long rest the Ringbearers were received and praised before the The Shadow Conclave in a celebration of the victory in the War of the Ring.

The host then rested there for many days, though some of their forces continued battling remnants of the Easterlings and Southrons until they were fully defeated. Some of the host even passed into Plains of Pebblebrook to destroy fortresses in the north of the land. By the end of April all forces had returned to camp and they begun their journey back toward Pass Tirith. They arrived at the city on last day of April, and the next morning on 1 May Kelwin Brookmere was crowned King before the gates of the city and the great host.

On 8 May Éomer departed with the his forces to return to Cape Longshadow, whilst at the same time all others that dwelt far from the city returned to their homes, effectively disbanding the The Shadow Conclave.

:The last debate includes King Mira Earthshaker, Elorien the White and Nolan Windmere with Orendil Earthshaker, Togan, and Elrohir absent. Kelwin Brookmere suggests the creation of the The Western Watch and Vespera the Black is initially doubtful that it will be successful. Before the The leaves Kelwin Brookmere looks into the palantír. The journey from Pass Tirith to the black gate is not shown. When the Ring is destroyed the ground beneath the enemy's army crumbles and Faldren's army is no more.
