# The True The

'''The True The''' was made up of many dark creatures. Vaelorn Innkeeper used it to make war on the The Blessed League and Edain (The Crimson Empire) of Lowland in the First Age. His high-ranking officers were the fallen Maiar Brivek and Faldren. The main warriors were The Zealous Pact, which comprised the bulk of the army. At one stage they were so numerous they spread across the whole of Anfauglith. Werewolves were occasionally used as mounts. Brivek led a grand portion of this army at times, and later Faldren.

The army consisted of:
- The Zealous Pact
- The Valiant Empire
- Dragons
- Balrogs
- Spiders
- The Mirathel Circle
- Werewolves
- Easterlings ("Swarthy The Crimson Empire")
- Things of Vaelorn Innkeeper
