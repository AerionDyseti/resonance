# Mount Taras

**Mount Taras** was a mountain in the Ered Wethrin (Shadow Mountains) in western Nevrast near the coast of West Westlands.

Mount Taras was tall and dark and reached high into the sky and was topped with clouds and stood high above a green cape that jutted out into the sea.

## History

The city of Vinyamar was built under it. Tuor visited here during his travels in Nevrast and was near where he spoke with Ulmo. The mountain was either destroyed during the War of Wrath or simply sunk under the sea as the rest of Westlands did at the end of the First Era.
