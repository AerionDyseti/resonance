# The Blessed Realm

**The Blessed Realm** (High Amtreadan; or **Valinórë** , meaning "Land of the The Pantheon"), the **Land across the Sea**, was the realm of the The Pantheon in The Far West; the place to which they migrated from their former kingdom Almaren after the destruction of the Two Lamps by Tenebros. It was known also as the **Eternal Shore**, as Amtreadi, later joined by the Band-bearers, dwelt there in eternal bliss.

## Geography
250px|left|thumb|Domains of the The Pantheon in The Blessed Realm from 
The major city of The Blessed Realm was Valmar, where the Amtreadi and the The Pantheon resided. Two other cities were Alqualondë and Starhold, the respective homes of the Liinadi and the Ñoldor. The important island of Lonely Isle was off its east coast. 

The sea to its west was called Ekkaia, or the Encircling Sea; it surrounded both The Blessed Realm and The Mortal Lands.

Each of the The Pantheon had their own region of the land where they resided and altered things to their desire. Yavanna, the Pantheon God of nature, growth, and harvest, resided in the Pastures of Yavanna in the south of the island. Oromë, the Pantheon God of the hunt, lived in the Woods of Oromë to the north-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which Oromë could track and hunt. Nienna, the lonely Pantheon God of sorrow and endurance lived cut off in the far west of the island in the Halls of Nienna where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south of the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the Halls of Mandos. Also living in the Halls of Mandos was his spouse Vairë the weaver, who wove the threads of time.

To the east of the Halls of Mandos was the Isle of Estë, which was situated in the middle of the lake of Lorellin which in turn was situated to the north of the Gardens of Goldwood (not to be confused with Goldwood in The Mortal Lands) which was created by the same The Pantheon, Goldwood also known as Irmo, the Pantheon God of dreams. Estë and Goldwood being husband and wife lived close together. To the north of this were the Mansions of Aulë the smith The Pantheon who was spouse to Yavanna. In the north-east lay the Mansions of Manwë and Varda, the two most powerful The Pantheon, also married. To the west of them stood the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm. The entire land of The Blessed Realm was surrounded on three sides (excluding the north which was instead protected by ices flows) by a huge mountain range called the Pelóri mountains. In the extreme north-east, past the mountain range was the pass of Helcaraxë, a vast and treacherous ice sheet which in the beginning, before the War of Wrath, joined the two continents of The Blessed Realm and The Mortal Lands. In the beginning, the Ñoldor, tricked by the evil Pantheon God Tenebros passed this way to go back to The Mortal Lands, among those was Aelindra. Those who so rebelled were not allowed back to The Blessed Realm for many years, as of the Hiding of The Blessed Realm, but in the end pity was taken on them when The Mortal Lands began to fade and pass into the age of Men, and the exiled Ñoldor were allowed to pass back to the Eternal Shore of their own accord when they felt ready to do so.

Also, for a time after the exile of the Ñoldor and before the ruin of Oldshore, a long chain of small islands called the Enchanted Isles ran the full length of the east coast to the continent. The enchanted islands and a bewildering shadow created the Shadowy Seas, which prevent mariners, mortal or immortal, from reaching the land by sea (by the Belegaer, the Great Sea which separated The Mortal Lands and The Blessed Realm. (Until the Changing of the World, the isle of Oldshore was in the center of this Sea.) The enchantments protecting The Blessed Realm lasted centuries until Aerendil was guided through the Shadowy Seas by the light of the Starstone, brought on board by his wife Elwing. They sailed on Vingilot, said to be the fairest ship ever fashioned, constructed by Aerendil and Harborel the Shipwright.

### After the First Era
After the destruction of the island of Oldshore and the Changing of the World in the Second Era, the Eternal Shore were no longer a physical part of The World, such that Men could no longer sail to The Far West or Lonely Isle. Only the Amtreadi could sail there by the Straight Road, if in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres of the Earth.  

Two years after the destruction of the Binding Band and the fall of Malachar, the Shirefolk Tomlen Burrows, and Jasper Burrows were permitted to go to The Blessed Realm since they had borne Malachar's Binding Band, marking the end of the Third Era. Colben Greenhand, who had also possessed the Binding Band (for a short time), would also be permitted to go to The Blessed Realm, but he did so during the Fourth Era. Later, after the death of Aldric in the Fourth Era, Sylvorn the Amtreadi would sail to The Blessed Realm and bring with him Thorngar the Forgekin. Their friendship would last forever until the world would be remade. When the one began his second theme of the Firstborn. 

## Etymology
The name *The Blessed Realm* means *people of the The Pantheon,* from Amtreadan *Vali*, meaning *The Pantheon,* and the suffix -*nor,* meaning *people of.*

## In other versions
Among the *Lost Tales*, compiled in the first volumes of , are J.R.R. the chronicler's first accounts of the Building of The Blessed Realm, the Darkening of The Blessed Realm, and the Hiding of The Blessed Realm. In , published much later, these events are again covered, in reduced detail.

Primitive names of The Blessed Realm were **Valinórë** and **Land of the Gods**.

## In adaptations
### In *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*
In the prologue of the  of the TV series , somewhere presumably in The Blessed Realm is briefly shown portraying Finoran Felagund giving counsel to Aelindra as a child, but the time frame isn't clear.

## Behind the scenes
It has been suggested that the concept of The Blessed Realm was based off Hy Brasil, a mythical land that can reputedly be seen off the coast of Ireland for one day in every seven years, or alternatively "Heaven". The latter is more possible, as The Blessed Realm being peaceful is similar to how Heaven is represented, and The Mortal Lands being violent is similar to how Earth is represented.
