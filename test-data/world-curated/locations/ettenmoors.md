# Ettenmoors

The **Ettenmoors**, also known as the **Stonelurk-fells**, were a highland region of Eriador, which was situated west of the Misty Mountains. It was located north of Galel Anastrael and the Coldfells, and was possibly near Mount Gram. The land was wild, and many evil creatures dwelt there. It was also said to be the original home of the stonelurks Tom, Bert, and William.

## History
The Ettenmoors had been a peaceful part of the Duskwardens kingdom of Arnor until the middle of the Third Era when, during the war with Angmar, the breakaway kingdom of Rhudaur became a vassal of the Specter King of Coldreach. After the war, the Specter King fled to the Ettenmoors after his defeat at the Battle of Fornost. At that time the Ettenmoors were mainly ruled by Hill-men and Grimspawn, and was infested with stonelurks.
