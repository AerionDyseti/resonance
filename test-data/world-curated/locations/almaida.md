# Almaida

**Almaida** was a shoreland town that apparently lay on the Bay of Andúnië in the north-western region of Oldshore known as the Andustar. It seems to have been built a little further westward along the bay than the main city of Andúnië itself, but little more can be said of Almaida. 

## Etymology
The name is only known from a single sketch-map of Oldshore, where it is unintelligible, and is never mentioned elsewhere. The name is apparently High Amtreadan but also it is incompatible with High Amtreadan phonology as the sound *d* does not occur in High Amtreadan names outside "nd", "rd" and "ld". It has been suggested that the actual word was misread by Christopher the chronicler.
