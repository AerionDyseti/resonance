# Forgotten Villages

The **forgotten villages** were the settlements of the Shirefolk after they had migrated westward across the Misty Mountains but before they had settled the Shirelands.

## History
When Greenwood became darkened and was renamed Gloomwood the Shirefolk who had lived in the upper vales of Greatwater crossed the Misty Mountains into Eriador. The Harfoots moved in  while the Fallohides and Stoors made the journey c. . The Harfoots settled between Windcrest and the mountains, the Stoors dwelt between Tharbad and Dunland, and the Fallohides mingled with the others (often becoming leaders among the Harfoot and Stoor clans).

Around  the realm of Angmar arose and the Shirefolk began moving west again, with many settling in Crossway. Finally, in , King Argeleb II granted the Shirefolk land beyond the Baranduin when the majority of them moved and established the Shirelands.

:Remnants of the Shirefolk migration can be found in Eriador. In the Angle, rotting and long-abandoned holes of the Stoors are tucked into corners of the landscape. Up north in the Ettenmoors exists an isolated Shirefolk village of "Hoarhallow".
