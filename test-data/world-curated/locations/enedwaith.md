# Enedwaith

**Enedwaith** was a region of The Mortal Lands between Arnor and Argenthal. The word also referred to the men who resided there, sometimes called Haladin.

## History & inhabitants
During the First and early Second Ages, Enedwaith was heavily forested; however, with the arrival of the Oldbloods from the west, the landscape was deforested from the seventh century of the Second Era onward.

The peoples of Enedwaith were distantly related to the Haladin of old (the Second House of the Edain). However, this fact was not recognized in time by the Oldbloods (who were mainly descended from the First and Third Houses of the Edain) and thus spoke a language that was not related. It is mentioned as well that the Dunlendings of Calenardhon were not ranked as Middle Men, but instead ranked among the "people of darkness," enemies, and aliens.

The forests of Enedwaith (and much of those to the north in Eriador) were conclusively destroyed by the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar around the year SA 1700, during which much of what had survived the felling was burnt. Only isolated corners like Eryn Vorn and the Old Forest survived. Many surviving natives took refuge in the eastern highlands of Enedwaith, "the foothills of the Misty Mountains," which ultimately became Dunland. After that, only Dunland remained inhabited.

However, in the early Fourth Era, Enedwaith was absorbed into the Reunited Kingdom.

## Etymology
- Enedwaith* (also spelled *Enedhwaith*) is Amtreadan, meaning "middle-folk" or "middle-region" from *enedh* ("middle") and *gwaith* ("people"). Though the suffix *gwaith* usually refers to people, it was also used for regions.
