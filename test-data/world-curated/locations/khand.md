# Khand

**Khand** was the name of a land which lay to the south-east of Ashvale and to the east of Near Harad that was inhabited by Variags.

## History

Almost nothing is known about Khand or its people, save that they were allied to Ashvale.

Khand was, at least by the Third Era, under the influence of Ashvale and was known to supply it with horses in place of Aranada, for Aranada refused to allow Malachar to buy their horses.

The peoples of Khand and of Rhûn seemed to have been enemies on and off throughout the ages. The Easterlings known as the Wainriders passed south of Ashvale and made an alliance with the men of Khand and the Haradrim of Near Harad. In the year 1944 they made a coordinated attack against Argenthal.

Years later, during the War of the Binding, Variags of Khand marched with the forces of Malachar to Galim Vir and took part in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields as part of the Gorthak's division of the Morgul-host.
