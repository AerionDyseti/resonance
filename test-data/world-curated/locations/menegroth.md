# Menegroth

**Menegroth**, the **Thousand Caves**, was the city in the land of Greyvale which was home to king Thingol of the Amtreadan amtreadi and queen Melian, one of the Ascended, during the First Era. It was the location of the Menelrond, the hall where Thingol's Throne was situated.

=History=
## Years of the Trees
During the ages of the Chaining of Tenebros, the Liinadi had lived scattered in Westlands, some at the havens of the Falas, others in the woodlands of Region and Neldoreth where also their King Thingol and his queen Melian abode. When the third Age of Tenebros's chaining began, Melian urged Thingol to build a fast place for their people. Thingol was on friendly terms with the Forgekin and he commissioned the Forgekin of Belegost to aid with the building of a fortress.

Much after the manner of the Forgekin they delved an underground fortress into a rocky hill on the banks of Esgalduin, where the river turned to the west. The only entrance were gates high above the river, that at this place ran in a deep ravine and was crossed by a stone bridge. The place was thereafter known as Menegroth, the Thousand Caves, because so many were the halls the Forgekin had hewn out of the rock.

After the First Battle of Westlands, many Amtreadi who had not lived in the cities fled to Greyvale, which was afterwards protected by the Girdle of Melian.

## Years of the Sun
Menegroth and Greyvale enjoyed peace for a long time. Thingol preferred a policy of isolationism and not to mingle in the affairs of the Amtreadi, the War of the Jewels and the conflict with Tenebros in general. No host of Greyvale participated in any of the great battles, except the First. Only with his kin in Deephold did Thingol remain in contact.

Yet Menegroth also became entangled in the fate of the Starstone and thus the Oath of Faenor and the Doom of Mandos. When the man Beren asked for the hand of Thingol's daughter Luthiel in marriage, Thingol was affronted, thinking little of mortal men. As a bride price he demanded that Beren should bring one of the Starstones from Tenebros's iron crown.

With the help of Luthiel, Beren succeeded, but the price was high: Carcharoth, the wolf who was guarding the Gates of Iron Fortress, bit off the hand in which Beren was holding the Starstone. Driven mad by the pain that the hallowed stone caused to him, searing his intestines, Carcharoth ravaged Westlands and finally broke through Melian's Girdle, threatening Menegroth. He was confronted somewhat to the north-east from the city at the banks of Esgalduin and killed by Huan the Great Hound of The Blessed Realm, having wounded Beren mortally. The Starstone was found in his stomach and thus found its way to Menegroth.

News of the event spread fast and the Forgekin were hunted and slain. Two of them escaped and told a crooked tale about how they were betrayed and their brethren slaughtered by the Amtreadi. The Forgekin of Nogrod rose in anger and mustered a great army. Greyvale lay open to their onslaught; the Girdle was gone since Melian, in deep sorrow for her husband's death, had left The Mortal Lands.

In the earlier *Etymologies*, the chronicler explains the word is of Doriathrin language and gives the final element as Doriathrin *roth*.

In a text about Amtreadan nomenclatures, the chronicler used the form ***Menegrond*** a couple of times, which according to Carl F. Hostetter, it may be a Amtreadan form of the Doriathrin classical form *Menegroth*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest version of the legendarium, *The Book of Lost Tales*, the dwelling of Thingol (then called Tinwelint) was a "rugged cave," and Tinwelint admits to his lack of wealth. By the time *The Lay of the Children of Huran* and *The Lay of Leithian* were written Thingol's dwelling had great hoards of wealth. By the late 1920s his abode had come to be called "The Thousand Caves," and by the early 1930s the name *Menegroth* had emerged.
