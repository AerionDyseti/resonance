# Greatwater

***Greatwater*** ("Long river") was the Amtreadan name for the **Greatwater of Wilderland**, or **Greatwater**, called the **Langflood** by the Éothéod, ancestors of the Aranadan.

It was The Mortal Lands's longest river in the Third Era. In *The Atlas of The Mortal Lands*, Karen Wynn Fonstad estimates a total length of 1,388 miles (approximately 2,234 kilometers).

## Geography

The Greatwater began as two different streams to the northwest of Gloomwood. These were called the Langwell and the Greylin by the Éothéod when they lived in the triangle of land formed by it. The Langwell had its source in the Misty Mountains, close to Mount Gundabad, and the Greylin began in the westernmost heights of the Grey Mountains. It flowed from these sources to the Mouths of Greatwater in the Great Sea (Belegaer).

### Course
The Greatwater flowed parallel to the Misty Mountains in a broad vale which formed the western part of Rhovanion, lying between the mountains and Gloomwood. Passing the Carrock and Old Ford, the river reached Goldwood, after which it left the mountains and flowed through the Brown Lands via the North and South Undeeps until it flowed past the Stone Hills. After passing the ferocious Rapids of Sarn Gebir and the Pillar Kings, it flowed into the lake of Nen Hithoel. Thence it flowed over the Greatfalls and past both the Mouths of Treewater and the marshes known as the Wetwang. It then passed between the White Mountains and the Shadow Mountains by the old capital of Argenthal, Starbridge, before passing close to the harbour of Harlond and the Rammas Echor south of Silverspire (Barbara Strachey, in *Journeys of Tomlen*, places the harbour just outside the wall), and the Emyn Arnen and down past the port of Pelargir, entering the Great Sea in the Bay of Belfalas in a broad delta known as the Mouths of Greatwater.

### Tributaries
In order from north to south, the tributaries of the Greatwater were: the Rushdown, the Gladden, which joined at the marshes known as the Gladden Fields, the Celebrant, the River Limlight, the Treewater, the Morgulduin, the Erui, the Sirith and the Poros. The first five had their sources in the Misty Mountains, the Morgulduin and the Poros in the Shadow Mountains on the border of Ashvale, and the rest in the White Mountains.

### Crossing points
The most northerly crossing point was the Ford of Carrock, held by the Beornings, who levied high tolls on those passing in exchange for keeping the vale of the river free of Grimspawn.

The Menn-i-Naugrim which led from the High Pass into Gloomwood crossed the river at the Old Ford, to the south of Bjorn's hall. In the Second Era the crossing had been by a Forge-built bridge, but by the Third Era this had long disappeared.

The North and South Undeeps were two defiles where the river could be crossed. The Balchoth passed this way during their invasion of Calenardhon in TA 2510.

The river could be easily crossed (possibly with boats) at River Keep.

There were bridges in the city of Starbridge. The Great Bridge was broken in TA 2475 and the last was broken by the forces of Argenthal in TA 3018 to halt Ashvale's attack on Starbridge, but were later partly repaired by Ashvale in the War of the Binding.

A road led from Pelargir to the Crossings of Poros, indicating either a bridge, a ferry crossing or a ford.

There were also two bypasses; a portage way around the Rapids of Sarn Gebir and the North Stair beside the Greatfalls.

### Islands

The principal islands of the river were River Keep, on the borders of Moonvale, and Tol Brandir in Nen Hithoel. Carrock, in the north, was where the eagles deposited Durgan and Company. There was also an eyot at which the Company rested during their travel between Goldwood and Parth Galen.

## Settlements

During the Great Journey in the Time of the Trees, the Nandor left the Eldarin host when faced with the great heights of the Misty Mountains, and subsequently lived in the Vales of Greatwater. Some of those people later left and became the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, but Liinadi Amtreadi remained present even until the time of the War of the Binding, strengthened by refugees from Westlands (at the end of the First Era) and Eregion (during the Second).

Settlements in the Vales of Greatwater during the Third Era included the Éothéod town of Framsburg, Bjorn's hall, and the Stoor-country near the Gladden Fields (where Slivven) was born. It was in the Gladden Fields in the northern reaches of Greatwater that Valorian was slain, and the Binding Band lost; and it was there, more than two millennia later, that Daglen found the Band and Slivven took it from him. Rhosgobel, home of Thornwick the Brown, and the Amtreadi realm of Goldwood also lay in the Vale of Greatwater.

Once it had entered Argenthal, the river flowed through Starbridge and past Silverspire and then Pelargir, close to the sea. After the fall of East Starbridge in TA 3018 the river effectively marked the eastern border of Argenthal.

## Etymology

***Greatwater*** is a Amtreadan name meaning "long river" or "great river".

## In adaptations

In Peter Jackson's *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy, scenes on the Greatwater were shot at the Waiau River in southern New Zealand.
