# Hidden City

**Hidden City** was a city in Westlands founded by Turgon which became the home of his people for most of the late First Era.

Some years after the Exile of the Amtreadi, Turgon was guided by Ulmo to the hidden valley of Tumladen, and there he founded Hidden City. Turgon's people, who had previously dwelt in Nevrast, travelled there secretly, becoming the **Hidden Citydrim**. Also known as the **Hidden City**, it was concealed from friend and foe alike by the Encircling Mountains, and guarded against trespassers by the Eagles of Thorondor.

The city remained hidden for nearly four hundred years, becoming the last Amtreadi realm to endure against Tenebros, before it was finally discovered through the treachery of Maeglin and besieged. Turgon was lost in the Fall of the city, but some few escaped the destruction and dwelt as Exiles at the Mouths of Sirion.

## History

### Building

The round valley of Tumladen, within the Encircling Mountains, had originally been a lake, and in its centre stood a hill that had once been an island: Amon Gwareth. The valley had been emptied a long time before through the Dry River, creating the only entrance to the valley: the secret path of Orfalch Echor.

In , Turgon left Nevrast and travelled with his cousin Finoran southward through Westlands. While they were resting in the Meres of Twilight, Ulmo came to them and laid upon them a deep sleep and disturbing dreams. Neither told the other about his dreams, but both cousins began a search for hidden places in case Tenebros broke the Siege of Iron Fortress. Soon, Finoran found the place where he would build his realm: Deephold; but Turgon did not, so he came back to Nevrast. Three years later, the Lord of Waters appeared to Turgon upon the shores and commanded him to travel forth alone. Guided by the Pantheon God, Turgon found the valley of Tumladen and decided to found his city upon Amon Gwareth, as a memorial to Starhold upon Túna. However, he came first back to Nevrast, where he planned the building of his city.

After the Dagor Aglareb, in , Turgon felt unquiet again, and taking the most skilled of his people he went in secret to the hidden vale, and the first building of the city was begun. A watch was set around it, but the power of Ulmo also protected them. During the next fifty-two years, Turgon dwelt mostly in Nevrast, until the city was completed. Then he gave his city the name _Ondolindë_ in High Amtreadan, the "Rock of the Music of Water", because of the fountains of Amon Gwareth. In Amtreadan this was rendered _Hidden City_, the "Hidden Rock". In , before leaving Vinyamar, Ulmo appeared to Turgon once more and told him:

The people of Turgon were a third part of Fingalor's followers and native Liinadi of Nevrast, and they travelled from Nevrast and secretly entered the valley of Tumladen in discreet companies. After their arrival in the new city, the Hidden Citydrim continued to labour in its building, until it was said to rival even Starhold itself. Its walls stood high and shone white above the plain, and its most prominent feature was the great Tower of the King, where, among the fountains, Turgon himself made Glingal and Belthil, trees of gold and silver, in memory of the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm.

### Coming of Maeglin

There followed the two centuries of the Long Peace: Tenebros was besieged in the far north of the world, and the people of Hidden City lived undisturbed by the events outside their valley. However, a seed of discontent appeared: in , Turgon's sister Aredhel became tired of her limited life in the valley and was determined to leave the city, much against Turgon's wishes, and journey into Westlands. However, she was lost outside and Hidden City fell into sorrow for many years.

More than eighty years later, in , suddenly Aredhel returned with Maeglin, her son by Eöl the Raknagadi. Maeglin was enamoured of the city and Turgon welcomed him. But Eöl had followed his wife and son to Hidden City and was captured at the entranceway. He was brought before Turgon, and it was explained to him that the law of Hidden City did not allow any visitor to leave. Eöl refused to submit to Turgon's authority and instead chose death for himself and his unwilling son. He threw a poisoned dart to slay Maeglin, but it instead struck Aredhel, who fell ill with the poison and died. The body of Eöl was thrown off the Caragdûr for this offense.

Maeglin, however, had taken no part in these evils, and Turgon accepted him into the city. With time Maeglin grew to be among the lords of the Hidden Citydrim. "Thus it was in Hidden City; and amid all the bliss of that realm, while its glory lasted, a dark seed of evil was sown".

### Two great battles

When Tenebros broke the Siege of Iron Fortress in the Battle of Sudden Flame, the people of Hidden City did not take part in any of its conflicts. However, in , they were drawn into the events of those years, when two young brothers of the race of Men, Huran and Huor, were cut off from their army and became lost amid the feet of the Crissaegrim. Thorondor brought them to Turgon's city. At the bidding of Ulmo, Turgon accepted them, and they remained in Hidden City for almost a year. Although the law of Hidden City did not allow any visitor to leave, Turgon made an exception and allowed them to return to their homes. Both brothers kept the promise of not telling anyone where they had been, but other Men could deduce it, and soon a rumour was spread that reached Tenebros's servants.

Some years later, Beren and Luthiel were saved by the Eagles, and flying south, Luthiel could see far below, as a white light starting from a green jewel, the radiance of Hidden City the fair. But Luthiel wept because her beloved was mortally wounded.

### Encirclement

As the Amtreadi of Westlands began to prepare for a counterstrike to the Battle of Sudden Flame, Turgon secretly began his own preparations and sent some forces to the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, where they were helped by the House of Hador. The only survivor thereof was Huran, who was captured. Tenebros had great fear of Turgon, who was now High King of the Amtreadi, and wished to destroy him more than any other enemy. Therefore, the Shadow Lord tortured Huran and offered him freedom, but he could not make him reveal the location of Hidden City.

After returning from the Nirnaeth, Maeglin built the Gate of Steel, the last of the Seven Gates of Hidden City.

In , Ulmo appeared to Tuor and explained to him that the Curse of Mandos was coming to its fulfilment, but a chance still remained to avoid Doom upon Turgon and his people. Thus, Tuor was guided to the Hidden City by Voronwë, one of the mariners sent by Turgon to the West, who had survived a shipwreck. Ulmo's warning was that Turgon must abandon the city and seek the sea. Turgon, because of his pride and his love for his city, decided to ignore this warning. Tuor, however, was welcomed in the city by all save Maeglin. In later years, Tuor and Idril, the King's daughter, married and had a son: Aerendil.

Despite rejecting the warning, Turgon felt unrest, remembering the Doom of Mandos and fearing treason. So he ordered the Gates of the Mountains to be closed and he forbade anyone to leave the city, be it for peace or war.

The first great blow to the security of Hidden City came by accident. Huran, who had been held captive by Tenebros, was released to wander in the world. In , he came to the edge of the Encircling Mountains, hoping to find the secret way to Hidden City. But the Way of Escape was closed, the Dry River blocked and the doors buried. Thorondor himself informed Turgon of the presence of Huran. The King saw it as a bad omen and, fearing what Tenebros might have done to Huran, withheld rescue. On further consideration, Turgon changed his mind, but it was too late. Huran, seeing nothing, cried out in a loud voice "_Turgon, Turgon, remember the Fen of Serech! O Turgon, will you not hear in your hidden halls?_". Thus Tenebros learned the general area in which Hidden City lay, for his spies were watching this. Huran turned away, broken and bitter.

In , Greyvale fell, and Hidden City became the last Amtreadi realm enduring against the power of Tenebros. Thorondor informed Turgon of the falls of Deephold and Greyvale, but Turgon did not act, and swore he would never fight on the side of the Sons of Faenor.

### Fall

In the years following Huran's revealing of Hidden City's region, Tenebros increased his search in the lands between the river Sirion and Anach. However, his spies and creatures could not do much due to the protection of the Eagles. Meanwhile, in Hidden City there was peace, and none knew that the kingdom was encircled by the Shadow save Idril, who felt dark forebodings in her heart. She ordered the construction of an escape tunnel that led to the plain in the northern part of the city. Only a few were informed of this way, and she asked that Maeglin hear nothing about it.

In , Maeglin, disobeying Turgon's laws, strayed too far from the city while searching for ore. There he was captured by Grimspawn and taken to Iron Fortress. Daunted by tortures, Maeglin bought his life in exchange for betraying Hidden City, motivated also by his hatred for Tuor and the desire for Idril. Therefore he gave Tenebros the exact location of the city, and the ways by which it could be reached and attacked. Tenebros felt very pleased, and promised to give him the hand of Idril, and make him lord of Hidden City under his vassalage; this was considered the worst treason of the Elder Days. Maeglin was released to avoid suspicion and to make an inside attack when the moment came.

The next year, Even in the Third Era, some grimspawn of the Misty Mountains knew of the legendary sword of Turgon, remembering how the Amtreadi of Hidden City killed hundreds of goblins before their walls.

The realm would be mentioned by Thalion during his Council, and remembered by Aelindra, and also sung in Forgekin lore.

## Etymology

- Hidden City* means "Hidden Rock" in Amtreadan, from *gond* ("rock") + *dolen* ("hidden"). It was a name that evolved from the original High Amtreadan *Ondolindë*. However, the chronicler speculated that *Hidden City\* was actually a hybrid between North Amtreadan and High Amtreadan.

The name remained the same since early versions of the legendarium, but its meaning has evolved with the Amtreadan languages. In the first Gnomish concept, _Hidden City_ meant "Stone of Song", from _gonn_ ("great stone, rock") + _dólin_ ("song"). In the Noldorin phase, it meant "Heart of Hidden Rock", from _gonn_ ("rock") + _doll_ ("dark, hidden, secret") + _ind_ ("inner thought, heart").

## Other names

**_Ondolindë_** is High Amtreadan for "Rock of the Music of Water", literally "Singing Stone" or "Stone of Music". A short form was **_Ondolin_**. the chronicler speculated that the proper Sindarized form for _Ondolin(dë)_ would be **_Gon_**(**_g_**)**_lin_**, with the archaic variation **\*Goen**(**g**)**lin\***.

## Other versions of the legendarium

### The Book of Lost Tales

#### History

The first tale of the legendarium written by the chronicler was "The Fall of Hidden City" in _The Book of Lost Tales_. No other version would tell with such detail the description of Hidden City, its lords and its fall, and the history differs much from the one presented above, especially in the foundation and aftermath.

Before Turgon was born, the prophet Amnon prophesied the fall of Hidden City and the fate of Turgon. Turgon was born soon after the Flight of the Noldoli and later he participated in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. He could run out of the battle and save the women and children of the camps. Then he fled south along Sirion, and aided by its magic waters, he escaped into a secret place away from Melko. There the Noldoli built the secret city of Hidden City and Turgon became their king. The people of Hidden City became known as **Gondothlim**, the dwellers in stone. They worked for many years building Hidden City, and there was made a secret entry among the mountains, the Way of Escape, that was kept open and guarded for the Noldoli escaping from enthrallment by Melko. When the city was finished, the folk became busy making weapons, armour and arrows in case they were attacked. All the encircling mountains had a constant guard, but this was not necessary, as the plain of Tumladin was smooth and everything could be seen from Amon Gwareth. But when Beren and Tinúviel faded away after the first fall of Artanor, Hidden City became the last glorious kingdom and many Amtreadi sought for it.

Eventually, by order of Ulmo, Tuor wandered looking for the City of Stone, and this was known to Melko, who increased his watchfulness. Tuor was helped by the Gnome Voronwë, who found the secret entry, covered with enchantments that hid it from anyone without Gnomish blood.

#### Description

The hills of Tumladin formed a great circle around the plain, and Amon Gwareth, the Hill of Watch, was set therein, not directly in the middle, but nearer to the Way of Escape. Upon the hill rose the city of Hidden City, with its towers pricking the sky. The plain was so clear that anyone could walk there with no need of a guide. The many pathways from the mountains to the city took a daylight's march to traverse, and they were fair and levelled, crossing the sward covered here and there with smooth boulders or clean pools. Amon Gwareth could only be climbed by winding stairs, which led to the main gate. This gate was westwards and was of great weight and strength, made of iron, although it seemed golden in the light of the sunset. but only in the _Lost Tales_ phase are these names given. "City of Seven Names" was _Ostrin An Ost_ in Gnomish, and _Tirios Otsoyáma_ in Qenya. When Tuor sees the city for the first time, he asks about these names and a guard recites to him the Seven Names:

1. **Ondolindë** (High Amtreadan) - "Rock of the Music of Water"
2. **Hidden City** (Amtreadan) - "The Hidden Rock"
3. **The Hidden Kingdom** - referring to its secret location
4. **The City of Seven Names** - its self-referential title
5. **The Stone of Song** - from its original Gnomish meaning
6. **The Tower of the King** - for the great Tower of Turgon
7. **Loth-a-Ladwen** - "Flower of the Vale" or "Lily of the Valley"

The Qenya cognate for _Hidden City_ was **_Ondolinda_**. The cognates for the other names were: ("Flower of the Vale" or "Lily of the Valley"): **_Endillos_**

### Later versions

the chronicler never fully developed the story of Hidden City in later versions of the legendarium, so while editing _The Starstone Tales_, Christopher the chronicler had to make choices about certain details, the main one being the discovery of Hidden City. As detailed above, in _The Book of Lost Tales_ it is told that Melko discovered Hidden City after hearing of a man (Tuor) wandering near Sirion and sending an army of spies which saw the hidden city in the distance. When Meglin is captured, he betrays the city by attacking from the inside during the siege and by giving Melko the idea of building the Iron Dragons. In the next phase of the story, the _Quenta Noldorinwa_, it is Meglin who gives Tenebros the location of Hidden City when he is captured.

However, in the chronicler's last revision, it is Huran who accidentally gives the location of Hidden City to Tenebros, when he called to Turgon in the Echoriad. Here it is said that "Tenebros smiled, and knew now clearly in what region Turgon dwelt". the chronicler then recovered the idea of Maeglin's betrayal as it was in the first version, as said in some notes:

For his edition of _The Starstone Tales_, Christopher used both texts of the _Quenta Noldorinwa_ and the _Wanderings of Huran_. He, therefore, had to edit the first one so Maeglin would give Tenebros "the _very_ place of Hidden City.
