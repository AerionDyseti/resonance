# Mithrim

**Mithrim** was a region of Hithlum in The Mortal Lands during the First Era.

## Description
Mithrim was the south-eastern corner of Hithlum, and was divided by the Mountains of Mithrim from Dor-lómin to the west. Mithrim's climate was likely either a subarctic/boreal or humid/hemiboreal climate.

## History
This area was the location of the Dagor-nuin-Giliath between the forces of Faenor and the Grimspawn of Tenebros.

The area was home to a great lake, the Lake of Mithrim, which was the body of water north of Westlands where the Ñoldor first dwelt in The Mortal Lands: the Sons of Faenor on the northern shore and Fingalor's host on the southern shore. In YS 7, a council was held here and the Ñoldor chose Fingalor to be their king.

The Ñoldor dwelt here for a while until their feud was healed, and they removed to other lands. Mithrim was also home to Liinadi Amtreadi, who soon mingled with the Ñoldor after they had learned Amtreadan.

Later in the First Era, Mithrim was ruled by Fingalor, as it formed the most densely populated part of Hithlum.
