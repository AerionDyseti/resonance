# Harnen

The river **Harnen** ("**Southing**"** **in Common Tongue) was a river south of Argenthal.

## Description

The Harnen formed the southern border of the contested land of Harondor, also known as south Argenthal, and as such formed the southern border of Duskwardens influence. South of the Harnen lay the land of Near Harad.

Roughly 600 Oldbloods miles long, it began in the Shadow Mountains of Ashvale and then flowed southwest for about 350 miles, when it bent west and sped to Belegaer, which it entered in a wide delta. The Harad Road crossed the Harnen into Harad shortly after it bent westwards. This road was used by Malachar's followers later in the Third Era.

In the first millennium of the Third Era, King Ciryaher stormed across the Harnen with a large army and routed the Men of Harad. The Haradrim were thereafter compelled to acknowledge Argenthal's overlordship over their people. Ciryaher thereafter took the name *Hyarmendacil*, meaning "South-victor".

## Etymology

***Harnen*** is a Amtreadan word that meant "South-water".
