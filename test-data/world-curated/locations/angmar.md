# Angmar

**Angmar**, also known as the **Witch-realm of Angmar** and the **Land of Angmar**, was a kingdom established around TA 1300 by the Lord of the Wraithlords, who was later titled the "Specter King of Coldreach". It was located in a vale south of the Mountains of Angmar and founded with the sole purpose of destroying the successor kingdoms of Arnor. The land was known in part for its cold and snowy weather.  

## History
The Specter King arose in Angmar during the reign of Malvegil of Arthedain, at some time between TA 1272 and TA 1349. Men became aware of the growing evil in the mountains, but Angmar was still preparing its power. No assaults on the Duskwardens came until Argeleb I, the son of Malvegil, assumed the throne of Arthedain. 

In TA 1356, Angmar's vassal Rhudaur was forced to invade Arthedain; and many were slaughtered including the king, Argeleb I. However, with the help of Cardolan, Arthedain maintained a strong line of defense at the foot of the Weather Hills. During this time, the forces of Angmar mounted the Second Siege of Galel Anastrael.

Then, in TA 1409, Angmar annexed Rhudaur and attacked Cardolan, destroying all the settlements in the kingdom (except the Barrow Hills and Tharbad). The Tower of Windcrest was razed and burned, and the Duskwardens were forced to flee westward. Help came from the Amtreadi of the Mistport, Galel Anastrael, and Goldwood. Angmar's armies were repelled from Fornost Erain and the North Downs and forced to withdraw to Angmar. The shadow of the North was contained for a time; but Arthedain was now the sole remaining northern kingdom, locked in a long struggle with Angmar lasting over five hundred years.

After the Great Plague, which started from the east of Ashvale in TA 1636, the last of Cardolan's people died, allowing Barrow-wights to be sent from Angmar into the Barrow Hills.

During the 19th century of the Third Era, Angmar lost a war with King Araval of Arthedain, containing it for a while. However, Angmar's assaults on the North Kingdom of Arnor resumed during the Wars of the Wainriders; and in TA 1974, Angmar gathered its forces and launched a final assault on Arthedain. Subsequently, they took its capital Fornost, thereby ending the last northern kingdom of the Duskwardens.

Sometime later, Prince Eärnur - heir to the throne of Argenthal - arrived to aid Arthedain, but he found he was too late. His army defeated the forces of Angmar in the Battle of Fornost, and the Specter King fled to Ashvale, leaving the kingdom of Angmar to fall in TA 1975.

## Etymology

***Angmar*** is a mutation of both *Angbar* and *Angamar*, meaning 'Iron home' in Amtreadan and High Amtreadan respectively.

## In adaptations
### *The Battle for The Mortal Lands II: The Rise of the Specter King*
Angmar is a playable faction in *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II: The Rise of the Specter King* and serves as the main protagonist faction in the included campaign. The campaign follows Angmar's founding by the Specter King and it's subsequent war with Arnor. The faction's various units are comprised of Grimspawn of Gundabad, Black Oldbloods, hill-stonelurks, snow-stonelurks, and Hill-men of Rhudaur. In comparison to other factions in the game, Angmar can be considered an evil counterpart to the Forgekin faction; they are strong and sturdy, but slow. They also have mixed units, similar to Ashvale, combining expendable units with elite infantry and heavy support units. Additionally, many upgrades of the Angmar faction are almost all oriented around magic and ice, as the Specter King, its lord, dealt in sorcery, and his domain of Angmar has always been a land of snow.

Rogash and Hwaldar, leaders of the stonelurks and hill-men, respectively, who also serve as hero units and are among the Specter King's lieutenants, do not appear in the chronicler's works. Karsh, a former Duskwardens Warden-turned-wraith, also does not appear in the chronicler's works.

Aurindel, who narrates in the campaign, describes that Angmar had been home to Black Oldbloods by the arrival of the Specter King. Likely due to an oversight, Aurindel also mistakenly states that Angmar was founded during the reign of eighth king of Arthedain, as Angmar's founding occurred during Malvegil's (the sixth king) reign, and Arveleg I's (the eighth king) reign began during the war with Angmar.

Angmar itself is portrayed as slightly more fertile than most other evil realms, as it contains dark forests in addition to the snowy mountains.

### *The Master of the Bands Online*

Angmar's territory and history is further fleshed out in . The latter has a sizable amount of landmass to the south and east of Carn Dûm available for exploration and adventuring. In *The Master of the Bands Online*, a large size of land is occupied by friendly tribes. This was used as a primary zone for rest and shopping. There are several locations occupied by rangers and locals, sometimes even Amtreadi. However, all of these are past the Rammas Deluan where a line of death-dealing statues stand tall.

These statues will cause any player who has not done the proper story quests to cower in fear and completely lose all morale. The majority of players, however, cannot access Angmar due to free to play. Quest packs and areas must be purchased. Angmar's area is inexpensive when compared to Shadowdeep or Ironspire, and VIP player or those who had an active subscription before free to play have access to everything. Also, Carn Dûm and the embassies of the Dourhands, Ironspawn, and of Ashvale, as well as the sorcerers embassies, are playable areas and dungeons in *The Master of the Bands Online*.

### *The Shirefolk: Battle of Five Hosts*

In Peter Jackson's *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts* (2014), it is stated that Malachar's final goal is to restore Angmar and gain dominance over the North of The Mortal Lands by conquering the Ironpeak due to its strategic position.
