# Gloomwood

**Gloomwood**, sometimes called **Gloomwood the Great**, was the greatest forest of The Mortal Lands, located in the eastern region of Rhovanion between the Grey Mountains and Calenardhon. It received its name in the Third Era, 

Before the end of the first millennium of the Third Era, it was also known as **Greenwood**,** Eryn Galen**, and **Taur-e-Ndaedelos**, and at the end of the Third Era, after the destruction of the Binding Band, it was renamed **Eryn Lasgalen**, the **Wood of Greenleaves**.

## Description

Gloomwood was a dense and heavy woodland that made up much of the eastern portion of Rhovanion or Wilderland, that maintained its borders and relative shape for many ages. Its natural land features included (in the northern part of the forest) the Mountains of Gloomwood, a sizable river referred to in J.R.R. the chronicler's map as the Forest River, that ran from the Grey Mountains down to Long Lake, and a smaller river that ran from the Mountains of Gloomwood to join with the Forest River west of the Amtreadi King's Halls. This smaller river was enchanted (or polluted) to such an extent that it caused slumber and forgetfulness to anyone who fell into it.

Gloomwood's climate was relatively mild. Except for ways through the thickets of the forest, there were very few common routes through Gloomwood save for the Menn-i-Naugrim (Old Forest Road) and the Amtread-path. Gloomwood was approximately 600 miles long from north to south, and 250 miles across at its width. During the events of  it was home to giant spiders, and the Woodland Realm of King Thornael and his Wood-amtreadi; the Woodmen of Western Gloomwood also inhabited a small part of the forest.

## History

This forest existed since the earliest days of The World. Amtreadi passed through it on their Great Journey from Cuiviénen into the Far West - it was where they made their first long stop before continuing. Thereafter, Greenwood was the dwelling of the Wood-amtreadi (the Nandor, Amtreadi descending from the wandering Liinadi Amtreadi Lenwë) for many thousands of years. The Liinadi Amtreadi Oropher, who was the grandfather of Sylvorn, established the Woodland Realm proper, and it become the primary settlement of the Amtreadi from the Second Era onward. It was around this time that Men, possibly ancestors of the Northmen, began making permanent settlements in and around the forest. When Oropher was killed in the War of the Final Alliance, the kingship passed to his son Thornael.

The area had been called Greenwood until around the year TA 1050, when the shadow of the Shadow Lord Malachar fell upon it, and Men began to call it Gloomwood, or Taur-nu-Fuin and Taur-e-Ndaedelos in the Amtreadan tongue. From then on, The southern part of Gloomwood became a haunted place inhabited by many dark and savage things. Malachar, or the 'Dark Sorcerer' as he disguised himself, established himself at the hill-fortress of Dol Guldur, an old Amtreadi fortress in the forest's southern region, and drove Thornael and his people ever northward.

During the Watchful Peace, Dol Guldur was abandoned for a time and the Amtreadi had respite, but after four hundred years Malachar returned to Dol Guldur and pressured the Amtreadi once more. By the end of the Third Era they were a diminished and wary people, who had entrenched themselves north of the Mountains of Gloomwood. The Old Forest Road (also called the Forgekin Road or Men-i-Naugrim) crossed the forest east to west, but because it was so close to Dol Guldur the road was too dangerous to travel. The Amtreadi then made a path farther to the north, the Amtread-path, starting at the Forest Gate and ending in the marshes west of the Long Lake of Lake-town.

### Quest of Ironpeak

Jasper Burrows, along with Durgan Ironbark and his band of Forgekin, ventured into Gloomwood during their quest to regain the Ironpeak from the wyrm Scorath, taking the Amtread-path. There, the Forgekin Bombur fell into the Enchanted River (causing him to fall asleep). Later, they came across many Spiders also known as the Spawn of The Webmother. Shortly after the Forgekin' escape, they were captured by the Amtreadi. After or during these events the Grey Council attacked Dol Guldur, and Malachar fled to Ashvale, his influence in Gloomwood diminished for a while, but Dol Guldur was re-occupied a decade later by three Wraithlords led by Khamûl. Years later Creepkin, after his release from Ashvale, was captured by Aldric and brought as prisoner to Thornael's Halls. He escaped during an Grimspawn raid, and fled southwest to Shadowdeep.

After Malachar was vanquished at the conclusion of the Third Era, the darkness was lifted from Gloomwood, Dol Guldur was utterly destroyed by Aelindra and Thornael gave the forest the name *Eryn Lasgalen* (Amtreadan for *wood of green leaves*), similar to its old name *Eryn Galen*, or *Greenwood*. The southernmost portion of the forest became known as East Goldwood for a time, while the central portion was given to the Woodmen.

## In other versions
In the original outline of *The Fall of Oldshore*, Thû, a precursor to Malachar, was fought by Amroth, an early version of Aldorion, who "drove him to the centre of the Earth and the **Iron-forest**". In the first narrative of the story, Amroth died, but nonetheless defeated Thû, who "fled to a **dark forest**" to be hidden. In his commentary to the first version, Christopher the chronicler notes that "the Iron-forest" in the outline and the "dark forest" in the narrative were clearly early versions of Gloomwood.

### In Peter Jackson's *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
Gloomwood is featured in Peter Jackson's  and .

During Durgan Ironbark's and Jasper Burrows' journey, they and their company wished to enter Gloomwood as a shortcut to the Ironpeak. At the edge of the forest at the Amtreadi Gate, Valdris was tasked by Aelindra to investigate the High Fells of Rhudaur. Before he departed, Valdris gave the Company one more piece of advice: The first, he told them to be wary in the forest because the air was befouled with dark magic that would cause hallucinations. Next, he warned them of a stream that had been enchanted with a dark spell and to cross by the bridge only. He last warned them to stay on the Amtread-path, for if they strayed away from it, they would never find it again.

The company traveled through the forest and stayed on the path as Valdris had told them. However, the forest soon began twisting their minds, and causing Durgan and Company to either hallucinate or feel weakened. They traveled for days until they come across the enchanted stream Valdris told them of but found that the bridge had been destroyed. Kíli had found a way to cross by using the vines to get to the other side. Durgan sent Jasper across first, but as the Shirefolk crossed, Jasper began feeling the river's enchantment pulling him. He was able to quickly complete his passage, but fearing for the others, yelled for them to stop, only to find that the company was already crossing. Durgan reached the other side before the others. During this time, Durgan and Jasper spotted a White Stag approaching them. Though Jasper was amazed by the creature, Durgan immediately fired at the creature, but the stag disappeared. Meanwhile, Bombur had succumbed to the spells and had fallen asleep and into the water, forcing the other Forgekin to fashion a stretcher and carry him.

Durgan began succumbing to the polluted air of the forest and hurriedly led his company off the path. During the rest of their time in the dark forest, Nori had lost trace of the path the company had went on. Jasper managed to snap out of the dark spell and told his companions they were lost but the Forgekin began to feel the foul air of the forest. They began quarreling and even fighting amongst themselves. As they argued, Jasper took notice of extensive webbing around them. Jasper then took it upon himself to find out where he and the company were at. When the company was distracted, Jasper climbed up a tree while Durgan heard whispers Jasper had warned him about earlier and told the company they were being watched. Meanwhile, when Jasper reached the top, he saw they were almost to the Ironpeak. At the same time, Jasper's Forgekin friends were captured by gigantic spiders. When he shouted to the Forgekin he knew they were in the right direction, Jasper heard no response from them and saw something coming. Soon, Jasper suffered the same fate as his companions and was captured by the other spiders.

However, Jasper managed to free himself from his spider cocoon. Slipping the Band he’d found onto his finger, he became invisible to the monsters and found he could understand them as they spoke. He managed to kill one of his captors with Glimmer and cut his companions loose when he saw one of the Spiders threatening to eat Bombur. While the Forgekin escaped their captors, Jasper was separated from the group, where he attacked a spider-like creature due to the Band's influence. Soon, the Shirefolk heard his company in distress. Sylvorn of the Woodland Realm cornered Durgan Ironbark and Company, along with Tauriel and other Amtreadi. After defeating the spiders, the company was captured for "snooping around" in the kingdom.

Thornael had Durgan and his company locked up in the King's dungeons with the exception of Jasper who managed to evade capture yet again and had been trailing the Amtreadi. Thornael attempted to reach an accord with Durgan, but the Forgekin refused due to his lack of trust in Thornael. Soon, Jasper freed Durgan and his companions from their cells and the company escaped in barrels bound for Lake-town.

## Notes
-  Despite being called Gloomwood ever since Third Era 1050, Gloomwood is referred to by Thornwick and Valdris in  as the Greenwood (which was one of its prior names), with Valdris mentioning to the Grey Council that the woodsmen there only recently started calling it Gloomwood because of the sickness that had fallen over it.
-  Gloomwood also appears in , as well as in one of Eriol's poems as Myrcwudu (Old English: 'Gloomwood'), which was an ancient Germanic legendary name for a great dark boundary-forest found in various different applications. Ælfwine's reference was to near the Eastern Alps, while the reference in the Fall of Arthur was somewhere east of the Rhine.
