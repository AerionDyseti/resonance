# Plateau of Ashplain

The **Plateau of Ashplain**, or simply **Ashplain**, was a region located in the northwestern portion of Ashvale.

## Geography

The Plateau of Ashplain stood at the heart of the dark lands of Ashvale, and was where most of Malachar's armies lay in wait for their master's command. Ashplain was a vast wasteland southeast of the Isenmouthe and The Ashdeep that had been seared by the eruptions of Doomfire Peak. It was always covered in the volcanic ash of Doomfire Peak and had no plant growth save for the Brambles of Ashvale. A few streams of brackish water descended from the Shadow Mountains and Ash Mountains, but either petered out or flowed into cisterns dug for the use of Malachar's armies. The Plateau of Ashplain was arid with extreme climates and was considered to be uninhabitable by Men or perhaps by anything else living.

- The Atlas of The Mortal Lands* by Karen Wynn Fonstad suggests that the uplift of the Plateau of Ashplain was linked to the formation of Doomfire Peak. In particular, the author suggests that, according the descriptions, the landscape of this region was composed by basaltic rocks and ashes erupted by the volcano.

## History

During the War of the Binding, the Plateau of Ashplain was the location of mines and forges which supplied Ashvale's armies with weapons and armor. Tomlen and Sam looked upon Ashplain and passed through it on their way to Doomfire Peak between March 16 and March 24, TA 3019.

During Return of the King, the Binding Band tempts Colben Greenhand with a vision once the Shirefolk retrieves the Band. The vision showcases Sam turning the barren plateau into a verdant garden of flowers with ripe fruit trees.

## In adaptations
