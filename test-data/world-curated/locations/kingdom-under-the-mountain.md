# Kingdom under the Mountain

The **Kingdom under the Mountain** was the name given to the Forgekin realm of Ironpeak.  It was founded in  when Thragol I came to the Ironpeak and discovered the Heart of the Mountain. and relocated the capital of the Longbeards. Under Thragol's rule the Heart of the Mountain was discovered, and many riches were mined from its depths. After Thragol's death and his son Durgan I had ruled for ten years, he abandoned the Mountain in  for the Grey Mountains; where his people were now gathering.

### Decline
After King Durgan left the mountain was once again a colony, and its status as capital city was transferred to the Ered Mithrin.

It was nearly four hundred years before Grundin's folk returned in mass to the Ironpeak. The reason for this being that the Forgekin of the Grey Mountains had been fighting a war against the Dragons, who had plagued the Forgekin for hundreds of years. In the year  King Náin II and middle son Frór were killed by a great Cold-drake at the entrance to their halls, which led to the decision by the two remaining heirs, Thragor and Grór, to leave the mountains with those who wished to follow them,

### Re-establishment
The following year the now king Thragor, led a group back to the Ironpeak, while his brother Grór led another portion to the Iron Hills, and even some stayed behind in the Ered Mithrin.

Thragor eventually made it to the Ironpeak, and declared himself King under the Mountain. Under Thragor's rule the Ironpeak once again became the capital of Grundin's folk, the Forgekin of Ironpeak became the best smiths and masons in Wilderland, trade increased with their kinsman in the Iron Hills and elsewhere, and they also became very rich.

### Sack of Ironpeak

But with this new found prosperity came trouble. It wasn't long before the great dragon Scorath heard of their great wealth, and one day decided to take their treasure for himself. In the year , Scorath descended on the mountain in a ball of fire. He killed King Girion of Dale with many of his knights, and he killed a large amount of the Forgekin living in the mountain. Most of the survivors fled to the Iron Hills, others went with the royal family into exile, and some simply went their own way.

While Grundin's folk wandered from the mountain to Dunland to the northern Blue Mountains; they ever longed for the halls of the Ironpeak.

### Restoration

In , with Valdris's council, Durgan Ironbark and a company of twelve forgekin, with the help of the Shirefolk Jasper Burrows, undertook the Quest of Ironpeak and retook the city and treasure. In the meantime the Dragon Scorath went to destroy Esgaroth, only to be killed by a man named Braden. 

Durgan was free to proclaim himself King under the Mountain. However the mountain was besieged by the Men of Esgaroth and the Amtreadi of Gloomwood, who wished recompensation for the damage done by the wyrm. Dagor Ironfoot arrived to support Durgan, but a great host of Grimspawn and Shadowwolves came to take the mountain. Then the Amtreadi, Men, and Forgekin were united and fought against them. After Durgan's and his nephews' deaths, Dagor was made King of Grundin's folk and of the mountain. Finally after so many years of longing the Longbeards finally returned to the Ironpeak.

### Later history
Under Dagor's rule the Forgekin of Ironpeak became very rich and prosperous. They rebuilt the town of Dale, their trade greatly increased with their kinsman in the Iron Hills once again and with Men; and the Ironpeak was restored to its original greatness. But once again trouble began to brew in the east. The Men of Dale were nearing war with the Easterlings, and in the year  an emissary from Malachar came to Dagor and said that if he were to give up the location of Jasper (who had discovered the Band of Binding in his travels) that Malachar would return to him the three remaining Forgekin rings. But being wary of the emissary, Dagor sent his kinsmen Glorin to Galel Anastrael to warn Jasper that Malachar was after him.

Several months later the Forgekin aided the Men of Dale who defended them against Easterlings. The Battle of Dale lasted for 3 days until they were forced to retreat into the Mountain; King Brand and King Dagor were killed at its very gates. The Forgekin and Men held out for several days until the besieged came forth from the Ironpeak, and drove the attackers back to the East, never to be bothered again.

After the death of his father, Durgan III Stonehelm became King of Grundin's folk and King-under-the-Mountain. Ambassadors were sent to the crowning of the King Stonehelm, and both kingdoms remained friends of Argenthal, subjects of the King of the West.
