# River Running

The **River Running**, called **Celduin **by the Amtreadi, was a major river of the region of Wildlands.

## Geography

The river originated beneath the Ironpeak and flowed south to the Sea of Rhûn. The Redwater and the Forest River out of Gloomwood were both tributaries of the River Running.
The river was 600 Oldbloods miles long, and ran from the Ironpeak south through the Long Lake, where it was joined by the Forest River, and thence through the eastern outskirts of Gloomwood. It then flowed southeast through apparently uninhabited regions of Wildlands to its confluence with the Redwater. After this confluence, the River Running passed through the land of Dorwinion and emptied into the great inland Sea of Rhûn.thumb|298px|Overhead view of the River Running
