# Harlond (Argenthal)

**Harlond** was the port and docks of the city of Galim Vir, used by river traffic from the southern regions of Argenthal. It lay 3–4 miles to the south of the city, where its fortifications ran alongside the great outlying wall of the Rammas Echor.

On 15 March Aldric and his followers in the fleet from the south landed at Harlond and swept north into the Battle of Galim Vir Fields.

## Etymology

- Harlond* is a Amtreadan name. It means "Southhaven". Paul Strack suggests that it is a compound of the prefixal form *har-* of *harn* ("south", "southern") and *lond\* ([land locked] "haven").

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2015: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:In the original version of Argenthal, Harlond was added as part of Flowerdale with the Eastern Argenthal region. It was seized by Morgul-grimspawn who blockaded the road as the Siege of Argenthal began. This version of Harlond is filled with enemy tents and siege engines, with the quests focusing on undermining the enemy forces. During the battle of the Galim Vir Fields, the player meets Aldric and the Grey Company as they disembark from the ships and fights alongside them throughout the city. After the war, Harlond is in the process of being rebuilt, with the quests focusing on aiding in restoration and renewal.
