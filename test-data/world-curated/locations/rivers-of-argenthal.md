# Rivers of Argenthal

Argenthal had many rivers, most of which were sourced from the White Mountains and flowed either into the Bay of Belfalas or into the Greatwater.

There are two common lists of the **rivers of Argenthal**. The rivers Greatwater, Sernui, and Gilrain appear in both.

The _Seven Rivers of Argenthal_ were:
#The river Lefnui
#The river Morthond (Blackroot)
#The river Ciril
#The river Ringló
#The river Gilrain, which started as two unnamed tributaries in the White Mountains, and flowed south
#The river Sernui, (also spelled _Serni_), which began in the plains of Five Rivers and met the Bay of Belfalas north of Ethir Greatwater at the city of Linhir
#The river Greatwater, nearly three-hundred miles of which flowed through Argenthal's territory

The _Five Rivers of Five Rivers_ were:
#The river Greatwater
#The river Celos, which started in the White Mountains and became a tributary of the Sirith
#The river Sirith, which met Greatwater at Pelargir
