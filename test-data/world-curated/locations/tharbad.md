# Tharbad

**Tharbad** was a ford and fortified town at the river Gwathló on the southern border of Eriador.

## Geography
Tharbad was located on the southern border of Eriador a few miles downstream from the confluence of the river Hoarwell and the river Glanduin, which formed the river Gwathló. The lower part of the river Glanduin was a fenland called the Swanfleet and the natural state of the upper Gwathló near Tharbad was a slow, wide river that spread into a fenland. Ships with a smaller draught could be sailed or rowed up the Gwathló as far as Tharbad.

The land around Tharbad was later drained, and dykes were built to construct a great port for seagoing ships, a bridge,

After he took the sceptre in , the King of Oldshore, Tar-Aldarion traveled up the River Gwathló as far as Tharbad and met Aelindra there. It is not known if Tharbad was just a ford or if somebody already settled at Tharbad at the time of their meeting.

The Oldbloods constructed a small harbour at the river's estuary to exploit the local timber: '', 'the New Haven', which was later called Lond Daer the Oldbloods had devastated the forests below Tharbad by felling trees to obtain timber to build ships. The local population who had lived in those forests had initially been in awe of the Oldbloods, but had become hostile to them and attacked and ambushed them when the felling of trees became devastating. In return, the Oldbloods treated their attackers as enemies. It is possible that the Oldbloods built the forts at the haven of Lond Daer and along the banks of the river Gwathló, because of those conflicts with the native population. The surviving native population fled from Enedwaith to the Misty Mountains in the east, and from Minhiriath to the dark woods of the cape of Eryn Vorn. It is not known if there were Oldbloods forts at the crossing of Tharbad or whether the crossing of Tharbad was lightly held by the Oldbloods or by forces of Malachar.

After a great fleet commanded by the Oldbloods admiral Ciryatur landed with troops from Númenór in , the forces of Malachar were defeated and driven back to the south-east to the river Baranduin. After another defeat at the Sarn Ford, they were driven back further to the south-east to the river Gwathló, where the forces of Malachar were reinforced by his force at Tharbad. However, Ciryatur had sent a part of his fleet to the haven of Lond Daer and landed a strong Oldbloods force there that attacked the forces of Malachar in his rear in the Battle of the Gwathló., the region of Enedwaith between the Gwathló and the Isen belonged to neither of those two kingdoms.

In the early days of the kingdoms of Arnor and Argenthal, a seaport where seagoing ships could dock was constructed and a fort was built on great earthworks on both sides of the Gwathló at Tharbad to protect the bridge., the North-South-Road from Argenthal to Arnor already existed, but Valorian, who was in haste, chose to take the shorter route north from Starbridge up the Vales of Greatwater to the High Pass over the Misty Mountains to return to the Amtreadi refuge of Galel Anastrael, where he had left his wife and his youngest son..

Until the decay of Arnor, both kingdoms shared an interest in Enedwaith, but were mainly concerned with the maintenance of the North-South Road, the bridge at the fortified town of Tharbad, and of the long causeways on which the road ran. Minhiriath, the region between the river Baranduin and the river Gwathló, became a part of Cardolan, one of the three successor states of Arnor. As a consequence, Tharbad probably became a part of Cardolan.

From about , the Stoors, a tribe of shirefolk, migrated to and settled in the area between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland, but they left around .

After the Great Plague spread north-west from Argenthal in , most of the people of Cardolan died, especially in Minhiriath. After that, Minhiriath was almost completely deserted,, but some survivors of the Plague continued to live in Tharbad. After the decay and receding of the kingdom of Arnor, which had originally included Minhiriath, in , Enedwaith and Minhiriath were devastated by great floods and Tharbad was ruined and deserted.

Over a century later in , the North-South Road no longer existed except for the crumbling remains of the causeways on both sides of the river, and the river was crossed by Valdric on a ford that was formed by the ruins of the bridge.

Before 22 September , the Wraithlords cross the Greyflood on their way to the Shirelands.

On 27 September  Valdris crossed the Greyflood with his horse Swiftmane at Tharbad.
Others occasionally crossed the ruined bridge - at their peril - including the Wraithlords, servants and spies of Morvain, as well as the Wardens of the North who sought Aldric in Aranada in .

After the War of the Binding at the end of the Third Era, the North-kingdom of Arnor was reestablished by Aldric II. It is probable that the town of Tharbad and its bridge were rebuilt. Valdris announced that the Greenway would be opened again, and that there would be people and fields where there was wilderness before and that there would be room enough for people between the Isen and the Greyflood.

## Etymology
- Tharbad* is a Amtreadan name. It means "road-crossing". Its original meaning is said to have been "the Stepping Stones". Tharbad was originally a ford over which one could walk. The name Tharbad was already used for the ford before the town was established.

'*2022: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:First built by the Oldbloods as a ford and settlement, Tharbad has been rebuilt over the many centuries of its existence. Its position upon the river Gwathló marks the boundary between the Cardolan and Swanfleet regions: thus making it a landmark in both regions. It is also the dividing point between the Greenway and the Old South Road. The ruins are currently occupied by Grimspawn. An expedition of hopeful settlers from Crossway-land camp nearby on the Cardolan side.
