# Morgulduin

**Morgulduin** was a river of Moonvale, which began in the Shadow Mountains and flowed through the Specter Vale, under the ghastly bridge that led into Galim Errav, and eventually into the Greatwater. Because it originated in the Specter Vale, it was icy-cold and its waters were polluted and not safe to drink from.

In the year TA 3019, Aldwin warned Tomlen and Sam not to drink from it, as the water was tainted and would harm whoever imbibed it.

## In adaptations

The Morgulduin appears, though it is not named, in Peter Jackson's _The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King_ as a wide, polluted river adjacent to Galim Errav.

## Etymology

**_Morgulduin_** was a Amtreadan word that meant 'Black-magic River'. The name Ithilduin means 'Moon River'. It is unknown if the name reverted during the Fourth Era.
