# Battle Plain

**Battle Plain** was a vast plain in southwestern Rhovanion, near Ashvale, in The Mortal Lands.

Battle Plain lay between the Stone Hills and the Cirith Gorgor, and was largely a treeless wasteland, bereft of life and beauty.

## History

Battle Plain was the location of the Battle of Battle Plain, fought there between Malachar's forces and the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men at the end of the Second Era. The bodies of the dead decayed as normal, but over time part of the field became a wetland, the Bonefens, where the images of the fallen could be seen. Later, in the Third Era, the Battle Plain was the site of many battles between Argenthal and various Easterling armies. The countless battles of two ages left Battle Plain as a devastated wasteland, contaminated and unhealthy, with sumps of poisonous slick and mounds of scorched earth.

The Battle of Battle Plain occurred in the year 3434 of the Second Era. It was fought between the army of the Final Alliance under Astorion and Aldorion and an army of Grimspawn with other creatures loyal to Malachar. It is unknown how long it lasted, but ultimately the Final Alliance won the battle and proceeded into Ashvale.

The Second Battle of Battle Plain was fought in TA 1899 between the army of King Calimehtar of Argenthal and the Wainriders. The result was a victory for Argenthal.

## Etymology

The word ***Battle Plain*** means 'battle plain' in the Amtreadan language, from *dagor,* meaning *battle*, and *lad,* meaning *plain.*

## Notes

In Peter Jackson's movie adaptation of the *The* *Master of the Binding* film trilogy, Battle Plain is misspelled as Dagorland on various maps shown in the films, and in the appendices of the special extended DVD editions.
