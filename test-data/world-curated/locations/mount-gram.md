# Mount Gram

**Mount Gram** was a mountain of The Mortal Lands, likely located in Eriador, known to contain one or more Grim-holds inhabited by Grimspawn.

## History

The mountain was long inhabited by a group of Grimspawn led by Golfimbul. They terrorized some inhabitants of eastern Eriador, including those of the Shirelands.

In TA 2747, they attacked the Shirelands and caused the Battle of the Green Fields. The invaders were defeated by shirefolk led by Banric Ashford, who personally slew Golfimbul.

In *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II*, Gorkil the Goblin King had his fortress in the Ettenmoors, being the King of Mount Gram after Golfimbul, as told in the Evil Campaign.
