# Umbar

**Umbar** was a realm on the coast south of Argenthal in The Mortal Lands. It included a great cape and a land-locked firth, which formed a natural haven. The name Umbar was used in conjunction with it being made into a great fortress, it being laid siege to or it being invested. Since these statements imply a small fortified area, it is probable that Umbar was also the name of a fortified city in this realm.

## Geography

Umbar was located south of the mouth of the river Greatwater at the Bay of Belfalas in a natural haven that was formed by a peninsula that extended west from the coast of the Belegaer sea and then bent to the south and almost touched the coast that lay to its south. This form of the coastline left only a narrow entrance to the natural haven. The City of the Corsairs was at the easternmost point of the bay of Umbar.

Umbar was the nearest of the realms of the Southrons to Argenthal.

It is possible that Umbar had a climate that was fluctuating between mild winters and very hot and dry summers. It is also possible that Umbar had a vegetation of sparse woodlands, because Umbar seems to have had the natural resources to build a fleet of fifty great ships and smaller vessels beyond count that had attacked Pelargir during the War of the Rings thirtynine years after Aldric had burnt a great part of the ships of the Corsairs in the haven of Umbar.

## History

### Foundation and Oldbloods rule

It is possible that the bay of Umbar was discovered by Aldarion, the son of the Oldbloods king Tar-Meneldur when Aldarion scarcely escaped shipwreck in the Harad during a voyage with three ships, which lasted from to . After Malachar heard that Aldarion had become a great shipbuilder who sailed his ships to haven far down into the Harad, he chose Ashvale as a stronghold to counter the threat of landings by the Númenoreans.

After Malachar was defeated by an alliance of the Oldbloods and the Amtreadi of Westshore and Eriador in the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar during the reign of Queen Tar-Telperiën in , he retreated from the coasts of The Mortal Lands and did not dare to challenge the Oldbloods for a long time.

Until the end of the reign of the Oldbloods king Tar-Minastir in , the Oldbloods came to The Mortal Lands as teachers and friends of the local population.

Approximately in the Oldbloods began to establish dominions on the coasts, which possibly already included Umbar. It is possible that the son of Tar-Minastir, Ciryatan sailed to Umbar, because he voyaged south before he took the sceptre from his father in .

During the reign of the Oldbloods kings Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir, who were both greedy for wealth, the Oldbloods formed two parties, the party of the Faithful, who remained faithful to the The Pantheon and maintained their friendship with the Amtreadi and the party of the King's Men, who followed the policy of the King to oppose the Ban of the The Pantheon that forbade to sail to The Far West and did not maintain the friendship with the Amtreadi. The King's Men sailed far away to the south of The Mortal Lands and established lordships and strongholds in Umbar, Harad and many other places on the coasts of The Mortal Lands. The Oldbloods in the service of Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir oppressed the men of The Mortal Lands and levied heavy tribute from the men of the coasts and their ships brought back metals and gems from The Mortal Lands. It is possible that Umbar was an important point from which tributes and other resources were shipped to Oldshore.

After the Wraithlords had appeared around the year and after the terror and mastery of Malachar over Men in The Mortal Lands had grown, Malachar began to attack the strongholds of the Oldbloods on the coasts of The Mortal Lands,
but he was not yet able to conquer Umbar.

Before he had married the queen of Oldshore Tar-Míriel and ursurped her throne, the Oldbloods king Ar-Pharazôn had been a leader in the wars of the Oldbloods on the coasts of The Mortal Lands. During this time in The Mortal Lands he became aware of the strength of the realm of Malachar and of Malachar's hatred against Oldshore. After his ursurpation of the throne, Ar-Pharazôn received reports that Malachar was attacking with his might, was pressing down on the cities by the coasts and had openly declared to intend to drive the Oldbloods into the sea and to destroy Oldshore, Ar-Pharazôn prepared an army and an armada of ships. In , Ar-Pharazôn landed with his armada at Umbar, marched with his army for seven days, and commanded Malachar to swear fealty to him. Malachar thought that he could not win by force, so he came and humbled himself before Ar-Pharazôn and was taken as a hostage to Oldshore. Umbar was remembered ever after with pride as the site of the landing of the Oldbloods army that had humiliated Malachar.

After the Downfall of Oldshore, Umbar remained in the hands of the Oldbloods, in essence a realm-in-exile alongside Arnor and Argenthal. But unlike these others, Umbar had been settled by the King's Men, who were afterwards called the Black Oldbloods, who hated the Faithful Oldbloods survivors of Arnor and Argenthal. Not all the servants of Malachar were killed at the end of the War of the Final Alliance Some of them were routed and dispersed and many remembered Malachar in their hearts and hated Arnor and Argenthal.

### Umbar as part of Argenthal

Argenthal's King Eärnil I repaired the haven of Pelargir, built a great navy and besieged Umbar by land and by sea. Umbar was only taken at great cost, because its Black Oldbloods inhabitants as descendants of the King's Men inherited their hatred of Argenthal as a realm of the followers of Aldorion In Ciryandil was killed in the siege of Umbar.

When King Valacar of Argenthal grew old there was already a rebellion in the southern provinces. Some of the Duskwardens refused to accept his son Eldacar as their future King, because Eldacar had been born in a foreign country, had been named Vinitharya in a foreign language in his youth and they feared that Eldacar would have a shorter life, because his mother, who came from a foreign country and who they perceived to be of a "lesser" race had only had a short life compared to the longer life of the Duskwardens. After the death of King Valacar in , a civil war, called the Kin-strife, began in Argenthal. In , It is possible that the rebels took their wives and families with them to Umbar; they had held out long with others of their kin in Pelargir and were able to gather people at Pelargir because Eldacar had no ships to besiege Pelargir by sea. Umbar remained at war with Argenthal for many lives of men and was a threat to the coastlands of Argenthal and to all traffic on the sea. The region of South Argenthal became a debatable land between the kings of Argenthal and the Corsairs of Umbar.

In , King Aldamir was killed in a war with the Harad and the Corsairs of Umbar. Hyarmendacil II defeated the Men of the Harad

The leaders of the Corsairs of Umbar, Angamaitë and Sangahyando, the great-grandsons of Castamir, learned through spies that Minardil, the King of Argenthal, was in the Solaaran port of Pelargir and that he did not suspect any danger, because his father had crushed Harad and Umbar. the Corsairs of Umbar, led by Angamaitë and Sangahyando, made a raid up the river Greatwater, killed Minardil in Pelargir, ravaged Pelargir and the coasts and escaped with great booty. and drove out the Corsairs in . because his grandfather Teluhmetar had captured Umbar and smashed the power of the Corsairs and the peoples of Harad were occupied with wars and feuds of their own. From that year to , Argenthal enjoyed a respite from war. In , because assistance from Umbar for an attack on Moonvale by enemies proceeding from Near Harad was not avaible. In the autumn of , King Eärnil II felt sufficiently secure to be able to send aid to Arthedain and sent an army of power for a war of great kings, although it was just a small force of the whole army of Argenthal, on so many ships that they could scarcely find harbourage, although they filled the Mistport, Harlond and Forlond. It seems unlikely that King Eärnil II would have felt sufficiently secure to send away such a large fleet from Argenthal to the aid of Arthedain if he would have feared an attack on Argenthal by ships from Umbar. It also seems unlikely that Argenthal would not have been able to hold Umbar when it still had a fleet and a mighty army, because Umbar could not be taken in the past in the days of King Ciryaher during a siege by the Men of Harad that lasted for many years, because of the power of the fleet of Argenthal. the Corsairs of Umbar attacked the coasts of Argenthal.

In , the 15th Prince of Swan Keep was killed by the Corsairs of Umbar.

The Corsairs spent a long time to prepare a great fleet. In three fleets sailed from Umbar and Harad and landed at many places along the coasts of Argenthal and even at the mouth of the river Isen and at the mouth of the river Lefnui. The troops from Umbar and Harad helped the Dunlendings who were led by Wulf, the son of Freca, a lord with wide lands on both sides of the river Adorn who was said to have much Dunlending blood and who had been killed by King Helm of Aranada, to invade Aranada from the west over the river Isen and down from Ironspire.

After the second arising of Malachar, Umbar fell under the domination of the servants of Malachar and the great white pillar that had been built on the highest hill of the headland above the haven by the followers of Aldorion as a monument for the humiliation of Malachar by Ar-Pharazôn was thrown down. It is possible that king Stonehelm completely subdued Umbar

## Culture

### Politics and rule

It is not known how the Oldbloods colony of Umbar was ruled before the Downfall of Oldshore when it was a stronghold of the King's Men who were afterwards called the Black Oldbloods. No "King of Umbar" is mentioned in the Annals of the Kings and Rulers after the Down fall of Oldshore. It is possible that the Black Oldbloods regarded the Heirs of Aldorion as usurpers. It is also possible that they did not decide on a new King as the successor of King Ar-Pharazôn, because they did not know if Ar-Pharazôn had survived the invasion of The Far West and had achieved his desire of immortality there or had died in The Far West or in the Drowning of Oldshore.

It is not known, if Herumor and Fuinur, who rose to power among the Haradrim in the wide lands south of Ashvale,

## Etymology

The origin of the name _Umbar_ was forgotten. Umbar already received its name before the ships of the Oldbloods sailed the sea. As a consequence, it is a name in one of the pre-Oldbloods languages. Despite the coincidental similarity, the name Umbar is not related to the High Amtreadan word _umbar_, which means fate.

## Other versions of the legendarium

The label "Havens of Umbar" is written below a bay that lies south of South Argenthal near the bottom edge of the General Map of The Mortal Lands that was included in earlier editions of _The Master of the Bands_. The City of the Corsairs lies at the easternmost point of the bay of Umbar on this map.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2023: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:The City of the Corsairs is known properly as "Umbar Baharbêl", and the realm also encompasses the Cape of Umbar and the few settlements upon it. Offshore from the cape is the shipwreck-strewn archipelago called "Zirâr Tarka, the Shield Isles" of Umbar, home to castaways, exiles, and freebooters. The Umbari language is partially inspired by Maltese.
:After the defeat at Pelargir and the downfall of Malachar, the Umbari people rebel against those those loyal to Malachar and the Haradrim "Empire of Ordâkh" occupying the city. Now a Free City, Umbar is ruled by a council of seven called the "Kindred of the Coins". At least some of the Kindred have designs against Argenthal, and so the players must investigate on behalf of King Stonehelm and Queen Elowyn, while befriending and assisting the citizens.
