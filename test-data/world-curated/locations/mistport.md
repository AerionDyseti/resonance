# Mistport

The **Mistport**, also known as **Mistport**, were seaports on both sides of the end of the Gulf of Lune near the mouth of the River Lhûn in western Eriador.

## History
### Second Era
Founded by the Amtreadi of Westshore in , the Mistport were known for their good harbourage and many ships; these were used by any of the Eldar to leave The Mortal Lands for Lonely Isle or The Blessed Realm. Harborel was Lord of the Havens from its foundation and into the Fourth Era.

In , *Entulessë*, a Oldbloods ship headed by Captain Vëantur, arrived in Mistport and it was there that the Oldbloods first landed in The Mortal Lands.

In the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar, the Lhûn was held in desperate defence of the Havens after Malachar had conquered almost all of Eriador. The beleaguered defenders were saved with the arrival of Tar-Minastir's fleet and Malachar's forces were driven back.

### Third Era
After the fall of Astorion (during the time of the Kings of Arnor), the Mistport was still home to the largest population of Amtreadi in The Mortal Lands, aside from Galel Anastrael in Eriador. Harborel remained the Lord of the Havens and ruled the Amtreadi of Westshore from Mistport. 

About , the Greycloaks or Wizards arrived in The Mortal Lands at the Mistport. Harborel, upon meeting Valdris, gave him Band of Fire, the Band of Fire.

In , Prince Eärnur of Argenthal brought a fleet of Solaarans to the Mistport to aid Arthedain against Angmar. The fleet was so massive that the ships of Argenthal filled the Mistport, as well as Forlond and Harlond.

In ,

### Later history

Following the defeat of Malachar and the crowning of King Aldric Stonehelm in the War of the Binding, the last of the Amtreadi set sail from the Mistport and left The Mortal Lands for The Blessed Realm. Years later, Fairbairn family tradition held that Colben Greenhand in  also sailed West from the Mistport. but it was recognized that eventually, its purpose would reach an end when no more Amtreadi wished to cross the Sea. At that time, Harborel would abandon the Mistport and finally travel the Straight Road himself. At some unknown date, Caelorn eventually sought the Mistport and with Harborel, they took the Last Ship together.

## Etymology

- Mistport* is Amtreadan for "Mistport", from *mith* ("grey") + *lond* ("harbour").
