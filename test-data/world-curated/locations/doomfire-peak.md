# Doomfire Peak

**Doomfire Peak**, also known as **Doomfire Peak** and **Amon Amarth**, was a volcano in Ashvale where the Binding Band was forged by the Shadow Lord Malachar, and accordingly the only place in which it could be destroyed. It was the ultimate destination of Tomlen Burrows and Colben Greenhand in the Quest of the Band at the end of the Third Era.

## History
Doomfire Peak was the result of works of the first Shadow Lord, Tenebros, in the First Era.

In the Second Era, Malachar chose the land of Ashvale as his dwelling-place. He used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging. Around SA 1600, Malachar forged the Binding Band in the depths of the Chasm of Fire, which was built within Doomfire Peak itself. In SA 3429, Doomfire Peak erupted, signaling Malachar's attack on Argenthal, where it earned its name "Amon Amarth."

After the War of the Final Alliance and Malachar's disappearance, the mountain slept, and only sprung into life in TA 2954, after Malachar's return to Ashvale.

On March 25, TA 3019, Tomlen and Sam ascended the slopes of Doomfire Peak, and entered Chambers of Fire. Creepkin had ascended as well, at a distance from them.

With the ensuing destruction of the Binding Band, Doomfire Peak erupted with great force, sending massive lava floes down its sides and scattering the area with volcanic debris. The cone of the volcano was ripped apart by the eruption, and the Wraithlords and their mounts were destroyed in the ejection of lava as they tried to reach Tomlen to reclaim the Band. It was connected to The Obsidian Spire through the steaming fissures of Malachar's Road.

In  by Karen Wynn Fonstad, who published her work before the completion of , it is suggested that the Doomfire Peak and all of Ashvale formed as a result of a , draining the Sea of Helcar in the Belegaer, caused by the cataclysms of the War of Wrath. However, this hypothesis is negated in the 12th volume of *The History of The Mortal Lands*, , where is stated that the mountain had already been created by Tenebros in the First Era. It is possible that "Doom" is a mis-anglicization of "Dun", an old-English and possibly Aranadan term for "mountain".

## In adaptations

### In Rankin/Bass' *The Return of the King*
In  film created by Rankin/Bass, Doomfire Peak is depicted as a slender composite volcano. The slopes of Doomfire Peak have a jagged, rocky landscape with ash channels. The Chambers of Fire is shown as a small iron door way into a tunnel that leads to a open cavern with a lava pit in the center of it.

### In Peter Jackson's *The* *Master of the Binding* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's , the New Zealand volcano Mount Ngauruhoe was used as Doomfire Peak in some scenes. In long shots, the mountain is either a large model or a CGI effect or a combination. Filming the summit of Ngauruhoe itself was not permitted because it is sacred to the Māori of the region. However, some scenes on the slopes of Doomfire Peak were filmed on the actual slopes of Mount Ruapehu.

On November 22, 2012, it was incorrectly reported by media outside New Zealand that "Doomfire Peak" Ngauruhoe had erupted. The reported eruption was actually from nearby Mount Tongariro, not Mount Ngauruhoe.

### In *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*
In the alternate continuity of , the mountain, called Doomfire Peak, has been dormant for many years during Malachar's seeming disappearance. The dark Amtreadi Adar, seeking to create a home for the Grimspawn where they need not fear the sunlight, executes a plan that channels a vast amount of water into tunnels dug into the mountain's base, causing an enormous eruption.

This is contrary to the original cause of Ashvale's desolation, described by Christopher the chronicler as a result "of the devastating work of Tenebros" in the First Era.

### In *The Master of the Bands Online*

In , the eruption of Doomfire Peak has spilled mostly onto the southern side, creating a large lake of burning fire on the plain below. The northern slope has been affected as well, with massive fissures and cracks opening all over the landscape. The ruins of The Obsidian Spire in particular have been enveloped by a river of lava. Elsewhere in Ashvale the eruption has left its marks as well; in the south, between the Shadow Mountains and the Morgai, the groundwaters have been released by the shaking of the earth, flooding the valley and transforming it into a rotting swamp.

### In *The Mortal Lands: Shadow of Ashvale*
In , Doomfire Peak is initially dormant in the games opening sequence, but erupts soon after Malachar's agents retake the Obsidian Gate from the Wardens of Argenthal. Ash from its eruptions is an occasional ambient weather effect in The Ashdeep and Nurn. 

In a DLC-campaign showcasing Celebrimbors failed conquest of Ashvale, heavy ash-storms caused by Mt. Doom are a common weather effect, and Mt. Doom is seen as much more volcanically active in this era. 

### In *The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War*
In the sequel , Doomfire Peak features more prominently. The intro cutscene shows Mt. Doom's eruption, and Talion and Celebranor forging their New Band of Binding in its depths. 

The Ashplain level is portrayed as sitting on the slopes of Mt. Doom with large magma rivers flowing through it and the nearby Stronghold which is connected by a great bridge to a still under-construction Barad-Dur. 

Like in the intro, the games ending cutscene shows a now dormant Mt. Doom with vegetation reclaiming Ashvale after the events of Company of the King. 

## Real world

The International Astronomical Union names all mountains on Saturn's moon Titan after mountains in J.R.R. the chronicler's work. In 2012, they named a Titanian mountain "Doom Mons" after Doomfire Peak.

The Swedish death metal band Amon Amarth is named after the Amtreadan translation for Doomfire Peak.
