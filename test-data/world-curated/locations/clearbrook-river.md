# Clearbrook River

The **Clearbrook River**, also known as the **Baranduin**, was a river of The Mortal Lands located in both the Shirelands and northern Eriador.

## Description

The Clearbrook River flowed out of Lake Evendim in northern Eriador, and continued eastward for about 60 miles before turning generally southward; and afterwards for about another 120 miles flowed through the easternmost reaches of the Shirelands, forming the Shirelands's eastern border and separating Brookshire, from the Eastshire and the rest of the Shirelands. Its only major crossings in the Shirelands were the Clearbrook Bridge (originally *Bridge of Stonebows*) on the East-West Road and the Brookbury Ferry.

Skirting the Old Forest to the south, the river then looped south-westward, crossing an old road at Sarn Ford and flowed to the north of the depopulated region of Minhiriath before flowing into the Great Sea to the north of the forested region of Eryn Vorn. The river also has an island known as Girdley Island in the river just above the Clearbrook Bridge.

No tributaries of the Clearbrook River are described except those near or in the Shirelands:

-  The Water - in the central Shirelands, from the northwest
-  The Stockbrook - arose in the Woody End
-  The river Shirebourn - rises in Green-Hill Country; the Thistle Brook flowed into it
-  Willowstream - from the Old Forest

## History

Tomlen Burrows' father, Dramon Burrows, was said to have drowned in the Clearbrook River with his wife during a boating trip.

The Clearbrook was much longer before the War of Wrath destroyed not only most of Westlands but part of the Great Gulf's northern shores.

To the shirefolk of the Shirelands, the Clearbrook was the boundary between the known and unknown, and even those who lived in Brookshire on the immediate opposite shore were considered "peculiar".

## Etymology

The name ***Baranduin** *was Amtreadan for "golden-brown river". The shirefolk of the Shirelands called it in their language **Branda-nîn**, meaning "border water", which functioned as a sort of pun. Later, the pun *Bralda-hîm*, meaning "heady ale", was coined. *Clearbrook* is simply the English rendering of the same word, as described by the chronicler.
