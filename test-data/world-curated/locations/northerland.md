# Northerland

The **Northerland**, the **Norland**, the **Northern Lands**, the **Northlands**, the **Northern world**, and the **North**, were vague terms for various lands of The Mortal Lands.

The regions of Anfauglith, the Ered Engrin, and Hithlum (Dor-lómin and Mithrim) were all described as belonging to the Northlands. During the late Third Era, Valdric referred to the regions north of the Tharbad as Northerland. The Crossway-land in Eriador were considered to be Northern Lands. While at Galel Anastrael, Jasper Burrows poetically described the sunken Westlands as Norland, a shortened form of Northerland, in his poem about Aerendil. During the Council of Thalion, Thorngar described Shadowdeep as being the greatest realm of the Northern world.
