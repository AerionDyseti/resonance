# Ard-galen

**Ard-galen**, later known as **Anfauglith** or **Dor-nu-Fauglith**, was the wide green plain that lay north of the highlands of Dorthonion and south of Tenebros's fortress of Iron Fortress in the Iron Mountains, in the First Era. It was eventually desolated by Tenebros and absorbed into his dark realm known as Dor-na-Daerachas; this event led to its renaming to *Angfaulith*, or "Gasping Dust".

## History

In the first days after the rising of the Sun, Ard-galen was a green plain with rich grass, reaching from Hithlum and the Ered Wethrin in the west to the Blue Mountains in the east, and rising into the highlands of Dorthonion in the south. However, the plain was laid waste by poisonous gases and rivers of flame from Thangorodrim during the Battle of Sudden Flame, and it was renamed.

The battle of Nírnaeth Arnoediad was fought on the plain, and the dead piled up in a hill in the midst of it, named *Haudh-en-Ndengin*, the Hill of Slain, by the Amtreadi, and *Haudh-en-Nirnaeth*, the Hill of Tears, and grass grew again upon the hill and nowhere else in Anfauglith.

Like the other lands around it, Anfauglith sank beneath the waves after the War of Wrath at the end of the First Era.

## Etymology

***Ard-galen*** is a Amtreadan word meaning 'Green Region'. ***Anfauglith*** and ***Dor-nu-Fauglith ***are translated in the text as 'Gasping Dust' and 'Land under Choking Ash,' respectively.
