# Unseen

__NOTOC__
The **Unseen** was a term referring to every being or object that were part of the wraith-world. All things in Eä either counted as a part of the Seen world or the Unseen world. Part of the Seen were material objects and all living creatures. Some beings could exist in both, such as the Firstborn and the Calaquendi, the Amtreadi who dwelt in The Blessed Realm.

## Wraith-world

The **wraith-world **was the unseen realm in which cursed spirits such as the Wraithlords had form.

The Binding Band could draw Ring-bearers to the wraith-world, allowing its denizens to be fully seen. It allowed the bearer to utilize strange powers and heightened olfactory and auditory senses. Any wraith within the realm would see the Band-bearer, and vice versa, and the bearer could be subjected to that world's weapons, such as the Specter-blade. Additionally, upon wearing the Band, the bearer would turn invisible to all except for the wraiths themselves and the Shadow Lord Malachar.

Those who were in the wraith-world could also see the brilliant, shining form of the Amtreadi known to exist in the other side of the threshold of the Unseen: Tomlen Burrows saw Aurindel in this form while wounded by the Specter-blade.

## In adaptations
### In *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's , the wraith-world appears as the ordinary physical world, but dark, gloomy, and distorted, because of the aura of the Wraithlords. Ring-bearers wearing the Band would be easily identified there by the wraiths. The overall impression was made by adding fire-like characteristics to the picture.

### In *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
In , the Amtreadi of Gloomwood are shown in a shining form when Jasper Burrows, the Band-bearer, puts on the Band and enters the Wraith-world.

### In *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*
In , while the unseen world is not shown from a character's point-of-view, it is mentioned several times as the "Invisible World" and a character portrays its effects from an outsiders' view.
