# Ethir Greatwater

The **Ethir Greatwater**, also known as the **Ethir**, '''Greatwater's Mouths**, and the **Mouths of Greatwater''', was the delta formed by the river Greatwater's egress into the Bay of Belfalas, and thus into the Great Sea of Belegaer. It was within southern Argenthal, near the great harbor of Pelargir in Five Rivers. It was considered one of the fiefs of the Outlands.

## History

The delta's earliest inhabitants were probably the Nandor. Some of the Nandor who had originally lived upstream in woodlands within the Vales of Greatwater before the Misty Mountains, traveled southward until they reached the Greatwater's mouth, where they made dwellings.

After the Nandor had gone, the land became settled by "lesser men", though they were likely in conflict with Haradrim. After the coming of the Oldbloods, the confluence of cultures in the Ethir and Pelargir formed one of the earliest forms of Common Tongue. The Oldbloods made a passage through the Ethir to be taken by ships going to and from Pelargir.

The Ethir was formed after the Downfall of Oldshore when the great storms in the island kingdom's drowning changed the shape of the coast. The shores of the Bay of Belfalas had retreated a great distance, putting Pelargir much farther inland than it had been originally. This led the Greatwater to carve a new path into the bay through many mouths.

In the days following the founding of Argenthal, the delta became an important area under the control of the new kingdom. Those Solaarans that lived there were mainly fisherman and sea-crafty folk who went out to the Belegaer on boats. Fishing had been the most profitable business in the Greatwater's Mouths for generations, and fish the main food source. to aid in the defense of Galim Vir. This left the Mouths themselves open to conquest by Umbar, but the occupation did not last very long; Aldric and the Grey Company liberated it several days later. delta") and _Greatwater_ ("Long river").
