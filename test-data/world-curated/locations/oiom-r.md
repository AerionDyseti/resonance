# Gal'ertra

**Gal'ertra** was the dim land between the shores of Alingal and the mountains of Imivir, high in the North near Tra'shanis at the Westshores of Sunimæ. At the western side of that frozen place were long and dreary plains, but bleak and ever colder as the ice drew nearer, and it was filled with mists.

## History

After the Darkening of The Blessed Realm, Tenebros and The Webmother fled the pursuing The Pantheon northwards through the barren and cold land of Alingal, traversing Gal'ertra and the Tra'shanis in order to reach The Mortal Lands.

The High Amtreadi led by Fingalor during their Flight possibly as well passed through Gal'ertra on their march to Westlands from The Blessed Realm through the Tra'shanis.
