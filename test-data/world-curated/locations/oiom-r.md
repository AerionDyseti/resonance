# Oiomúrë

**Oiomúrë** was the dim land between the shores of Araman and the mountains of Pelóri, high in the North near Helcaraxë at the Westshores of Belegaer. At the western side of that frozen place were long and dreary plains, but bleak and ever colder as the ice drew nearer, and it was filled with mists.

## History
After the Darkening of The Blessed Realm, Tenebros and The Webmother fled the pursuing The Pantheon northwards through the barren and cold land of Araman, traversing Oiomúrë and the Helcaraxë in order to reach The Mortal Lands.

The Ñoldor led by Fingalor during their Flight possibly as well passed through Oiomúrë on their march to Westlands from The Blessed Realm through the Helcaraxë.
