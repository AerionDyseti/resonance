# Starkhorn

The **Starkhorn** was a large jagged snow-clad peak that rose in the inner regions of the White Mountains of The Mortal Lands.

## History

It could be seen quite clearly from the southern end of the refuge of Darkharrow in Aranada. From its feet sprang the Snowbourn River, whose widening valley ran northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of Aranada. The Aranadan called that valley Harrowdale, and built their courts of Horsehold at its mouth, from where the lonely white peak of the Starkhorn could be seen along the straight length of the valley.
