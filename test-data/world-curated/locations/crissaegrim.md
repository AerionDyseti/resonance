# Crissaegrim

The **Crissaegrim** formed a part of the southern Echoriad and were home to the Skywardens of Thorondor.

The great Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim after Tenebros's return to Thangorodrim. It was here that Thorondor, the Lord of the Skywardens lived, and from here he watched for spies attempting to find the hidden city of Hidden City in the vale of the River Sirion.

## Etymology

**_Crissaegrim_** is Amtreadan for "cleft mountain peaks", but in the chronicler's stories the place is usually referred to as **Nis'verim**, the "Eagles' Cleft", or "Abode of Eagles" because the peaks were inaccessible from the ground.
