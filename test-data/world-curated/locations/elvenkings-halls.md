# Amtreadi King's Halls

The '''Amtreadi King's Halls''' were a cave system in northern Gloomwood, in which King Thornael and many of the Amtreadi of Gloomwood lived during most of the Third Era and into the Fourth Era.

## Description
The halls were just inside the eastern border of Gloomwood on the north bank of the Forest River, some miles upstream from Esgaroth.

The entryway to the halls had huge stone doors

## History
About  the Shadow began to fall upon Greenwood (causing it to be called Gloomwood). In response, King Thornael led his people to the north-east corner of the forest and delved there a fortress and series of great halls underground. He was inspired in this enterprise by Thingol's halls of Menegroth in Greyvale during the First Era. Like Thingol, Thornael enlisted the aid of the Forgekin in making his stronghold, though the Amtreadi King's Halls of Gloomwood were less grand than that magnificent ancient cavern.

In the autumn of  About 20 June , Grimspawn attacked and Creepkin disappeared. Nothing more is said of these halls.
