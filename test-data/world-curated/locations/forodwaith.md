# Forodwaith

**Forodwaith** was the name of both a region (also known as **Northerland** and the **Northern Waste**) and its inhabitants, located in northern The World.

## History
Forodwaith was first created after the War of Wrath, when most of the Iron Mountains were destroyed. Its geographical predecessor was the region of Dor-na-Daerachas, which was hemmed behind the Iron Mountains.

Little was known of Forodwaith, except that it was an area of immense cold due to the proximity to the Gap of Ilmen, and Tenebros's evil cold. After the War of Wrath and the breaking of the World, the Iron Mountains were mostly destroyed, and the area of Forodwaith that lay directly north of Eriador became known as Forochel, together with the great icebay and cape that carried the same name. Some of the Dragons fleeing the War of Wrath also journeyed into the Northern Waste, where they would multiply over many centuries.

The Men of Forodwaith were a strange folk, apparently unrelated to the Edain. During the Third Era, they were known as the **Snowmen of Forochel** or Lossoth. In , it is stated that they could glide on ice by tying bones to their feet.

Arvedui, last King of Arthedain, fled to the Icebay of Forochel after his realm was destroyed by Angmar, and the Lossoth helped him survive the winter. Against their advice, he took ship to sail south, and he was drowned in the icebay, together with the Seeing-Stones of the North. The chieftain of the Lossoth counseled Arvedui not to go aboard the ships and face the bitter northern winter, but the king refused and went anyway. In payment for his safekeeping, King Arvedui gave to the Lossoth his ring, the Band of Barahir, and bade them ransom it to his kin when the Lossoth had need. Unfortunately, the chieftain's counsel proved wise, and Arvedui was lost at sea, thus ended the Kings of Arnor, and their line continued as the Chieftains of the Duskwardens of Arnor.

## Geography and climate
Forodwaith was located in the northernmost part of The Mortal Lands. It was a vast tundra, reaching all the way to the northern poles, and spanning across most of The Mortal Lands, until it hit the northern peaks of Orocarni to the East. It was dominated by a polar climate, which is characterized by each month having an average of less than fifty degrees Fahrenheit.

## Etymology
The Amtreadan name *Forodwaith* translates loosely as "Northern lands", and was a name for the land north of the Iron Mountains of the First Era.

## In other versions
In earlier versions of the legendarium, the Forodwaith were originally conceived as a mythical representation of the , while their land, i·Ponōrir, was the mythical representation of Scandinavia. In this tales one of their chieftains, Orm, killed the father of Ælfwine/Eriol.

## In adaptations
### *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*
Forodwaith appears in the  of  as the location where Aelindra leads a small force to look for evidence of Malachar's whereabouts. They discover an abandoned fortress built by Tenebros in which remains an anvil marked by Malachar; Aelindra's followers are here attacked by a snow-stonelurk, which she defeats. The location also appears in a flashback of the  of the , where Malachar attempts to coronate himself among the grimspawn of that time.
