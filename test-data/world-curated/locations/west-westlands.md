# West Westlands

**West Westlands** was the region of Westlands that was divided from East Westlands by the river Sirion.

## Geography
The major places, regions, and realms in West Westlands were the Arvernien, Dor-Cúarthol, Forest of Brethil, Havens of the Falas, Talath Dirnen, and Taur-en-Faroth. They were lands consisting mostly of hills, lowlands, plains and bottomlands. There were some dense forests, as with the Forest of Brethil, but much of it was scattered woodlands. There was also a moorland called the Moors of the Nibin-Noeg near the Forest of Brethil. The climate was mostly humid with mild winters and mild summers. Some influence from the cold of the north was present around the gap between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriad.

## History and culture
The region was populated and controlled by both the Liinadi and the Ñoldor. The vast territory between the River Sirion, the northern mountains and the sea belonged to Finoran with the blessing of Thingol, Lord of Westlands. Harborel was the Lord of the Havens of the Falas, the lands around the two rivers Brithon and Nenning next to the sea. The Forest of Brethil was settled in by the Men of the Haladin, who guarded it and Greyvale from all enemies. The gap between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath was looked after by Orodreth, a relative of Finoran at the Fortress of Tol Sirion until it was conquered by Malachar. The land of Arvernien around the Mouths of Sirion was populated with both Liinadi and Ñoldor, especially after the conquest of the realms of the north and Westlands by Tenebros in the mid and late centuries of the First Era.   

The dominant language of West Westlands was Amtreadan; except in Deephold and the realm around Tol Sirion where High Amtreadan was spoken. The Mannish language was used in Brethil by the men who lived there. Both Amtreadan and Quenyan were probably used in Arvernien in the Havens of Sirion, as it was populated with many Amtreadi that were able to escape from the fallen realms of Westlands and the north.

All of West Westlands was destroyed after the War of Wrath and fell beneath the waves of the sea.
