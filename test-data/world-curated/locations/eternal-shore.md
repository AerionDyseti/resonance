# Eternal Shore

__NOTOC__
The **Eternal Shore** were a realm inhabited by Firstborn and Eldar. The area included the continent of The Far West and the island of Lonely Isle. The ocean Belegaer separated the Eternal Shore from the western shores of The Mortal Lands. With very few exceptions, only immortal beings were allowed to live in this realm.

## History
### Eldar Days and Second Era
Originally, mortals were allowed to trade with those from The Blessed Realm in the Eternal Shore, but were forbidden to sail west beyond the sight of Oldshore. However, in SA 3319, Malachar deceived Ar-Pharazôn, the King of Oldshore, that the ruler of the Eternal Shore would be granted immortality. To prevent the king's invasion, Ilúvatar sank Oldshore beneath the ocean and set the Eternal Shore forever beyond the reach of mortal Men. Amtreadi were still permitted to sail across the sea to the Eternal Shore, if they chose to (which most did).

### Third Era
In TA 3021, which is two years after the defeats of Malachar and Morvain, Harborel the Shipwright accompanied Thalion, Aelindra, and Valdris, the Keepers of the Rings, on a voyage to the Eternal Shore, where they intended to remain. They were also joined by Tomlen and Jasper Burrows, Shirefolk who were known for bearing the Binding Band. They were among the very few mortal beings to be allowed passage to the Eternal Shore.

### Fourth Era
Eventually, the Shirefolk Colben Greenhand, the Forgekin Thorngar, and the Amtreadi Sylvorn, made the journey to the Eternal Shore.

It is unknown how Manwë took to Thorngar's arrival to The Blessed Realm, as, long earlier, he would have killed Aerendil for coming there uninvited, and only spared him because he came on behalf of Amtreadi and Men.
