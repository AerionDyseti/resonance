# Barrow Hills

The **Barrow Hills**, or **Tyrn Gorthad**, was an area of low hills located to the east of the Shirelands and the Old Forest, and southwest of the town of Crossway. They were made by men in the First Era, and served as resting places for the men of the north, as well as Duskwardens, until evil spirits called *Barrow-wights* came and began to inhabit their barrows.

The downs lay within the region of Cardolan in the region of Eriador.

## History
### Before the Great Years
Tyrn Gorthad was first made and inhabited by "forefathers" of the Edain in the First Era. They fled when Eriador was invaded by Easterlings, but when they disappeared after the War of Wrath the Middle Men returned to the region.

By the Second Era as the Oldbloods began to establish colonies in Middle Earth the Barrow Hills were where the Duskwardens emigrants from Oldshore first came to reside. When Aldorion came to The Mortal Lands around SA 3320, the Barrow Hills were incorporated into his northern kingdom of Arnor.thumb|left|The ancient center of Cardolan

When Arnor was sundered into three realms in TA 861, Tyrn Gorthad became part of the realm of Cardolan. When Cardolan fell to Angmar in TA 1409, the Duskwardens of Cardolan took refuge in Tyrn Gorthad until the Great Plague wiped out the survivors. The Specter King unleashed apparitions known as "Barrow-wights" upon Tyrn Gorthad to haunt its great tombs of men, for over a millenia. In TA 1851 King Araval of Arthedain attempted to resettle Cardolan, but the settlers were driven off or killed by the terror and power of the wights.

### Tomlen's encounter

Fleeing the Shadow Riders in September of TA 3018, Tomlen Burrows and his three companions came and were ensnared by a wight in one of the numerous barrows. The four were separated from one another in a dense fog, and, all captured, ended up in the same barrow. Three of the Shirefolk seemed under a spell, but Tomlen, almost succumbing to the wight, was able to call out to Tom Willowmere, whose house was near the place of the Barrow Hills. Hearing Tomlen, Tom came with haste to the barrow and dispelled the evil spirit from the tomb. He had told the shirefolk earlier to pass by the barrows on the western side, but the shirefolk stopped for lunch on what must have been a barrow, and promptly fell asleep in the shade on the east side. After their rescue, the shirefolk each took from the spoils of the tomb a finely crafted Duskwardens knife, and continued their journey towards Crossway.

## Appearances in adaptations
