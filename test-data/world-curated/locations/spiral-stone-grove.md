Location Description: A cathedral-like cavern in the Deep Mycelium features crystalline spiral stones that resonate with temporal energy. Currently, these stones show contamination from a future explosion, which will create temporal disturbances and may serve as a way for time-displaced individuals to return to their own time. The party is tasked with gathering these stones as part of their quest, with significant implications for the campaign's narrative.

## Overview

A cathedral-like cavern at the deepest reaches of the Deep Mycelium, where crystalline spiral stones grow naturally from ancient fungal beds.

## Description

The Spiral Stone Grove is a place of profound dunamantic resonance. Crystalline formations grow in perfect spiral patterns from the fungal substrate, catching and refracting the bioluminescent light. The air here hums with temporal energy.

## Current State

The spiral stones are now threaded with sickly green veins—contamination from the explosion that will happen here in the future, its effects already echoing backward through time. The crystals that grow here are sought by the Dro'adi for their temporal properties.

## Significance

- **The Impact Site**: This is where the green star will strike, creating an explosion that echoes backward and forward through time
- **The Shockwave Origin**: The temporal disturbances plaguing the Deep Mycelium originate from this future event
- **The Way Home**: For the time-displaced party, being present at this impact may be the only way to return to their own time

## Quest Connection

Matriarch Thae'lynn tasked the party with gathering spiral stones from this grove—the original objective that led them into the Deep Mycelium.
