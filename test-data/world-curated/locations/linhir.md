# Linhir

**Linhir** was a haven with a ferrybridge over the river Gilrain. It was located just downstream from the juncture of the river Gilrain and the river Serni on the western side of the river in Dor-en-Ernil in southern Argenthal. Through it passed the road from Erech to Pelargir.

On 11 March , Aldric arrived with the Grey Company and the Army of Ghosts at Linhir where men of Lamedon were defending the fords over the river Gilrain against men from Umbar and from Harad, which had sailed up the river. Except the stout-hearted Angbor, the Lord of Lamedon, both the defenders and the attacking forces fled in terror from the Army of Ghosts. Aldric asked Angbor to gather his troops and to help him to pursue the men from Umbar and from Harad over the river Gilrain to Pelargir where the main fleet from Umbar was anchored.

## Etymology
- Linhir* is a Amtreadan name, which means "fair stream". It is properly a river name for the joint course of the river Gilrain and the river Serni from their junction to the sea. Paul Strack suggests that it is a compound of *lind* ("fair") and the lenited form of *sîr* ("river").

:As in the book, Linhir was a city in the region of Central Argenthal. It straddled the rivers Serni and Gilrain just past their confluence and therefore was built in both Dor-en-Ernil and Lower Five Rivers, but was mainly considered part of the former. Three brothers, "Erchar", "Garvir", and "Herion", sons of the late "Comeldir", commanded the soldiers of Linhir following Aldric's passage. The brothers were commanded to defend the city, but Erchar and Herion instead attacked the enemy forces in Dor-en-Ernil, resulting in the deaths of many of their men. The brothers were later convinced to return, and when both sides recovered from the terror of the Oathbreakers the remaining Corsairs and Haradrim launched a second attack. The Solaarans were again victorious but suffered heavy losses.
