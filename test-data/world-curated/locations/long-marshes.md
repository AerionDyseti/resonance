# Long Marshes

The **Long Marshes** are a region of marshes and pools dotted with small islands. They flank both sides of the Forest River, extending from the eastern edge of Gloomwood nearly to the shores of the Long Lake.

By the time of Durgan and Company’s journey in TA 2941, the marshes had expanded significantly due to floods, heavy rains, and earthquakes. This made the area even more treacherous, with the Forest River breaking into numerous winding courses through the marshes. The only safe way through was by following the river itself.

The Long Marshes are described in  when Jasper and the forgekin float down the Forest River after escaping from the Amtreadi King's Halls. The marshes are depicted as a vast, waterlogged expanse, adding to the challenges faced by travelers in this part of The Mortal Lands.
