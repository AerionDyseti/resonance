# Hithlum

**Hithlum** was the region north of Westlands which was separated from it by the Ered Wethrin near the Helcaraxë.

## Description

The Ered Wethrin ran along the southern and eastern edges of Hithlum and had few passes. The north-western boundary of Hithlum was formed by the Ered Lómin which curved to meet the Helcaraxë. The land of Nevrast was separated from Hithlum by the southern part of the Ered Lómin. Nevrast was usually seen as part of Hithlum but more closely resembled the rest of Westlands. Lammoth lay to the west. Hithlum's climate was cold and wet, however, the soil was quite rich. The Ñoldor made their first landing at the Firth of Drengist and first camped at the shores of Lake Mithrim.

## History

Hithlum became the realm of the ruling Ñoldor living in exile in The Mortal Lands. Hithlum contained Mithrim and Dor-lómin. Mithrim was the seat of the High Kings of the Ñoldor while Dor-lómin later became a fief of the House of Hador.

During the later part of the First Era, Hithlum was repeatedly attacked by the forces of Tenebros. Hithlum was lost to Tenebros after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. The Men of the House of Hador in Dor-lómin were either scattered, killed, or enslaved, while the Ñoldor of Mithrim who failed to flee were enslaved in Tenebros's mines. When Tenebros betrayed the Easterlings, he imprisoned them in Hithlum.

Hithlum, like the rest of Westlands, was completely destroyed and sunk during the War of Wrath.

## Etymology

***Hithlum*** is North Amtreadan for **Mist-shadow** after the sea mists that occasionally formed there. The index to *The* *Silmarillion* refers to it as meaning **Land of Mist**. Its High Amtreadan counterpart is ***Hisilómë*** and its Amtreadan counterpart is ***Hithlaw*** or ***Hithlû***.
