# Specterhold

**Specterhold** (originally called **Tower of Moon**) was the twin city of Silverspire before its fall to the forces of Malachar in the Third Era. It was situated some way within the narrow Morgul Valley, guarding the pass between Moonvale and Ashvale.

## Description
300px|thumb|*Specterhold* by Matthew BurtonIn its prime, Tower of Moon was a beautiful place. It sat high on a rocky seat "upon the black knees" of the Shadow Mountains, overlooking the valley. Moonlight reflected off the marble walls of the city so that it seemed to shine. The tall tower of the city had many windows, and the topmost part rotated slowly from one side to the other. A white bridge crossed the nearby river, with large meadows on both banks of the stream.  

After being taken by the forces of evil, the city became terrible, and the valley was filled with decay. The city was lit by a pale white light, and the gate was shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth and eyes. The meadows were filled with deadly white flowers emitting a sickly odour. At the head of the bridge crossing the Morgulduin were corrupted human and bestial statues. The river steamed a poisonous, deadly cold vapour, and the water was undrinkable.

The city was accessed by the Morgul-road, which ran from Starbridge to the crossroads and along the north side of the Morgulduin until across from the city, where it crossed the valley on a white bridge before wounding up to the city gate in the northern wall.

## History
### Second Era
After the destruction of Oldshore, Valorian and Anareth, the sons of Aldorion, landed in Argenthal. Valorian built Tower of Moon near the mountainous border of Ashvale from where he would rule the fief of Moonvale; while Anareth built Tower of Dawn to rule over the fief of Anórien. Tower of Moon housed the Ithil-stone, a *seeing-stone.*

When Malachar returned after escaping Oldshore's destruction, he attacked the exiles of Oldshore, and his forces took Tower of Moon by storm. When the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men defeated Malachar in the year , Tower of Moon was restored as a watchtower.

### Third Era
After the defeat of the Specter King of Coldreach in the north, he returned to Ashvale in , summoning the other Wraithlords with him to prepare the return of their master. A few years later () they laid siege to Tower of Moon and two years later they managed to take the city. The Ithil-stone was also captured and later used by Malachar to influence Morvain and Thornhelm II.

Tower of Moon was occupied by fell creatures, and it changed into a foul, evil place.  As a result, it came to be called Specterhold, which in the tongue of Argenthal means "Tower of Dark Sorcery". Many Solaarans fled from Moonvale.

During the Watchful Peace, the lords of Morgul had secretly bred the Ironspawn, and in  these creatures assailed and overran Moonvale.

### War of the Binding
During the War of the Binding, a host from Specterhold set forth toward Silverspire. The host was witnessed by Tomlen, Sam and Creepkin. After some opposition in Starbridge, the Morgul-host proceeded to the Silverspire Fields and laid siege to Silverspire. However the host, including the city's garrison was devastated during the Battle of Silverspire Fields.

Following the battle, the Army of the West pulled down the bridge leading to Specter Vale and set its fields aflame. They met no opposition as the entire city's garrison had been killed at the Battle.  

After the War of the Binding, Aldwin was made Prince of Moonvale by King Stonehelm, who advised him to make his abode in the Emyn Arnen south-east of Silverspire for "Tower of Moon in Specter Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years". It is not known if the city was ever rebuilt.
## Etymology
**Specterhold** is a Amtreadan name. It means "Tower of Sorcery". It is a compound of *minas* ("tower") and *morgul* ("black sorcery"), *Morgul* is a compound of *mor(n)* ("black") and *gul* ("sorcery, black arts").

**Tower of Moon** is another Amtreadan name. It means "Tower of the Moon" or "Tower of the Rising Moon".
## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier drafts, Specterhold was called Minas Morghul, and guarded Spider Pass (then called Kirith Ungol) instead of the Tower of Spider Pass.
