# Galadla

**NOTOC**
**Galadla**, once called by the Shirefolk **the Faerie**, was the region of The Far West where the Amtreadi lived in ancient times before the Changing of the World.

## Description

The size of Galadla is unknown, but the area between the Bay of Galadla and the Imivir mountains was probably at least a few dozen miles wide; Galadla also consisted of the shore of Holy Mountain and the Anastr'nis (Light-cleft) where Starhold was built. The shore probably extended hundreds of miles to the north of the Anastr'nis.

The city of the High Amtreadi (and for a time all Amtreadi also) was Starhold, which was built on the hill of Tuna facing both the Two Trees and the starlit seas.

The city of the Liinadi, on the north shore of the Bay was Galel Sunverba, or Haven of the Swans, whose halls and mansions were made of pearl. The harbor was entered through a natural arch of rock, and the beaches were strewn with gems given by the High Amtreadi.

In the bay was Lonely Isle, which was an island at one time adrift, until the Vala of the Sea rooted it in the bay.

South of Galadla was Avathar, once the home of The Webmother, a vast creature in the shape of a spider.

## Etymology

**_Galadla_** is an Ancient Amtreadan compound meaning "Elvenhome" or "Region of the Lasting Folk," from _gal_ ("area, region") + _ad_ ("folk, community") + _la_ ("lasting, eternal").
