It was located west of the Blue Mountains and south of the Gulf of Lune which divided Westshore into the northern region of Forlindon and the southern region of Harlindon. At the head of the Gulf lay the seaport Mistport. There were woods at the foot of the Blue Mountains and a haven in a small inlet on the southern shores of the bay of Harlond. 

At the beginning of the Second Era, Caelorn and Aelindra lived in Harlindon before they moved to Eregion in SA 750.
