# Aranada

**Aranada**, also called the **Kingdom of Aranada** and the **Aranada** (Aranadan), was a great kingdom of Men located in the land once known as **Calenardhon**, situated in the plains between the Misty Mountains and the White Mountains. The kingdom of Aranada extended from the banks of the River Isen in the west, up to the East Wall of Aranada and shores of the River Greatwater in the east. The forest of Deeproot lay on its border, and the Amtreadi forest of Goldwood lay north of the River Limlight.

The land was known as "Aranada" to the Solaarans, and its people the Aranadan, meaning 'the Horse-lords', but the people of Aranada called themselves the Aranadan, sons of Eorl the Young, first King of Aranada. The province of Calenardhon was given in gift to Eorl and his people by Cirion, Steward of Argenthal, in thanks for their service to Argenthal in battle against the Balchoth. Eorl swore an oath of friendship, and of aid when summoned, to the Lords of Argenthal, and thus the Aranadan became the greatest ally of the Solaarans from the later part of the Third Era and beyond. They were known for their cavalry and horse mastery, which was crucial in battles such as the Battle of the Thornwall and at the Galim Vir Fields.

## History

### Descent from the Northmen

In the 13th century of the Third Era, the Kings of Argenthal made alliances with the Northmen of Wildlands, a people thought to be distantly descended from the Edain, those peoples of Men who crossed into Westlands in the First Era and later settled in Oldshore. The Men who would become the Aranadan were in fact more closely akin to the Beornings and the Men of Dale, and were accounted as Middle Men, who, while not directly descended from the Men of Oldshore, never served the will of Malachar. In , Aldric describes the Aranadan:

Early in the Third Era, such men occupied a part of Wildlands, the lands east of Greenwood, west of the inland Sea of Rhûn, and south of the Celduin. While never united under one single king, the Men of Wildlands nonetheless were allies of Argenthal, and many of the great Princes of Wildlands and their kin served in the armies of Argenthal. In this way was the ruling House of Argenthal mingled with the Northmen during the reign of King Eldacar, and some Northmen intermarried with the Duskwardens of the South and were eventually reckoned Solaarans.

In the late 19th century of the Third Era, one such population of Northmen, dwelling in the eaves of Gloomwood, became a separate people under the lordship of Marhari, a descendant of Vidugavia, one of the most powerful princes of Wildlands. Fighting alongside King Narmacil II of Argenthal, his people were defeated by the Wainriders, invaders from the east, and the Northmen were either scattered or enslaved. Marhwini, son of Marhari, took up the lordship of his father and, retreating west and north with a remnant of his people, became the first Lord of the Éothéod, the people who would become the Aranadan. Settling first in the Vales of Greatwater between the Carrock and Gladden Fields, his people began to slowly recover their strength, and became known as the Éothéod, the horse peoples. Marhwini, and later his son Forthwini, continued their alliance with Argenthal, fighting the Wainriders and other eastern invaders alongside Kings Calimehtar and Ondoher. Although the Éothéod won a victory over their Wainrider foes while allied to Argenthal, their settlements remained near the Greatwater.

### The Éothéod

In the 1970's of the Third Era, after the downfall of the Specter King and his Kingdom of Angmar, their need for larger lands and the growing menace of Dol Guldur, forced Frumgar (called Frungor in some texts), Lord of the Éothéod, to lead his people north along the eastern banks of Greatwater. They settled near the sources of Greatwater, south of the Grey Mountains. Their chief settlement became Framsburg, which lay in a vale between the rivers Langwell and Greylin. During their time in the far north, the Éothéod and their horses multiplied, and they drove the remaining Hill-men and Grimspawn of Angmar out of their lands. Fram, son of Frumgar, slew the wyrm Scatha, last of the Great Worms of the Grey Mountains save for Scorath; thus he won great wealth from the horde of Scatha, as well as renown for the deed. He also earned the hatred of the Forgekin of that region, for they claimed the treasure of Scatha. Fram infuriated the Forgekin by sending them the teeth of Scatha, strung as a necklace, and denying them the rest of the hoard. Some say that for this insult the Forgekin slew Fram, for whom the settlement of Framsburg was named; for that reason there was no great love between the Aranadan and Forgekin.

Five centuries of relative prosperity followed for the Éothéod in the north, and they became a numerous people with many farms and horses. In 2501, their chieftain Léod captured a white foal in the wilds; this foal would grow to great stature, but remain wild, and was not tamed by any man. When Léod decided to mount the horse, it bore him away from his stables and eventually threw him, whereupon Léod's head struck a rock, killing him. Eorl, son of Léod, took up the lordship of the Éothéod at sixteen years of age, and was resolved to find this white horse. Upon a time, Eorl found and confronted the stallion, but rather than slay him, Eorl commanded that the horse give up his freedom as a weregild for the killing of Léod. This horse understood the speech of men, and submitted to Eorl, and was named anew Felaróf.

### The Gift of Calenardhon and the Oath of Eorl

In the year TA 2509, Eorl received summons from Cirion, Steward of Argenthal. The Steward pleaded for help from Argenthal's old allies; as a large army of Easterling Balchoth had invaded the province of Calenardhon and threatened to overrun it. Eorl surprised even the errand-rider of Argenthal by agreeing to come to the aid of Cirion. Though young, Eorl wisely perceived that if Argenthal should fall, all the lesser realms of men west of Greatwater would eventually fall. He gathered all the Men of the Éothéod that could possibly be spared, some 7000, and, leaving his land at risk of invasion itself, rode south to the aid of Argenthal. Despite a prejudice against the Amtreadi that would continue up until the time of the War of the Binding, a protective mist seemed to come out of Goldwood as the Éothéod journeyed south, rejuvenating horse and rider and shielding their approach from their enemies. Believing that there would be no time for the Éothéod to help his armies, Cirion nonetheless met them in battle on the Field of Celebrant, though Argenthal's legions were worsted. All hope seemed lost when an army of Grimspawn came upon the flank of the army of Argenthal, but at that moment Eorl and his cavalry thundered out of the north unlooked for and, smashing into the rear of the Balchoth, completely reversed the fortunes of battle. Argenthal's army was saved, and the riders of the Éothéod drove the Balchoth into the Greatwater.

Cirion committed the guardianship of Calenardhon to Eorl and his men for three months, during which time the Steward took counsel to determine what reward he could present to the Éothéod for their heroic arrival on the Field of Celebrant. At the end of the three months, he rode north with his son Hallas and his counsellors, and led Eorl and some of his guard to the hidden tomb of Aldorion upon Amon Anwar (Hill of Awe), which was later renamed Halifirien (the Holy Mountain) in Aranadan. Cirion realised that the Éothéod as a people needed more room to flourish, and that they would make for a strong ally to Argenthal against the growing threat of Malachar and the continued harassment of the Easterlings. Therefore, upon Amon Anwar he told Eorl that in reward for their aid in battle, he would grant the land of Calenardhon to the Éothéod to dwell in. Eorl was so impressed and grateful for Cirion's gift that he swore to the Steward the Oath of Eorl; of everlasting friendship to Argenthal, and aid to the South-kingdom in war. Eorl thus became the first King of Aranada, and his army sent north for their wives and kin. Coming into the land of Calenardhon the Éothéod were named anew the Aranadan in Argenthal, and named their new realm Aranada of the Riders, and themselves the Aranadan.

### The Kingdom of Aranada

Eorl was succeeded upon his death by his son Brego. It was Brego who completed the great hall of Goldenhall, which became the home of the Kings of Aranada thereafter. Brego's first son Baldor made a vow to tread the Ghost Road at the celebration to commemorate the completion of Goldenhall, but was lost in the caverns beneath Dwimorberg. Brego was grieved at the loss of his son and died soon afterward, leaving rule of Aranada to his younger son Aldor. Aldor was called 'the Old', for, coming young to the throne, he ruled Aranada for 75 years.

Of the Kings between Aldor and the 7th king Déor, little is known, but during the time of Déor, the Dunlendings, lesser Men who once dwelt in the mountains and vales but whom the Aranadan drove west over the Isen upon entering Calenardhon, began again to raid the western borders of Aranada. In 2710, the Dunlendings captured the mostly-deserted fortress of Ironspire, and held it in defiance of the Aranadan.

The Dunlendings continued their harassment of Aranada through the time of Helmric Ironhand, 9th King of Aranada. Helm was a man of great stature and strength, and a strong king who wished to again subdue the Dunlendings. One particularly troublesome Dunlending was named Freca; though he claimed descent from the fifth king Fréawine, Freca was mostly of Dunlendish blood. Nonetheless, he held a good amount of land by the Adorn river, and had there made himself a stronghold where he largely ignored the rule of Helm. On a time, Freca came to Helm's council at Horsehold, and there suggested that the King allow his daughter to wed with Wulf, son of Freca. Helm, seeing this as nothing but a ploy to bring Freca's heir close to the royal house and thus increase the potential for Aranada to fall into Dunlending hands, mocked Freca. Freca then insulted the king, and Helm took him to a field outside Horsehold where he smote Freca a blow with his fist, killing him. Then Helm sent his men west to drive away Wulf and his followers, declaring them enemies of Aranada.

By ill chance, these events were followed by an attack upon Argenthal by the Corsairs and a long and terrible winter. Seeing the opportunity to attack Aranada while its allies were beset by other foes, Wulf, in alliance with the Easterlings and Corsairs, led a strong force of the Dunlendings out of Ironspire and defeated Helm's army, driving the king and many of his people to the fortress of Súthburg. Wulf captured Goldenhall, and Helm's son Haleth was slain in its defense. Wulf sat upon the throne and called himself king and the Long Winter began, during which many of the people of Aranada perished from sickness and hunger and battle with the Dunlendings. Helm, besieged inside the Súthburg, became gaunt and grim, and eventually began to venture from the fort at night, stalking the camps of the Dunlendings and killing men with his bare hands. Before he would come forth in the dark, Helm would blow a blast upon his great horn, which struck fear into his enemies, and they fled upon hearing it. In this way, Helm won renown, and was much feared for many generations after by the Dunlendings, but one night he froze to death outside the walls of the fortress, later renamed the Thornwall in his honour.

With the onset of spring, Helm's nephew Fréaláf Hildeson led a small army down from Darkharrow, where another remnant of the Aranadan had lasted out the winter. Coming upon Horsehold unawares, they slew Wulf and reclaimed Goldenhall. Helm's body was brought back from the Thornwall and buried in the last mound of the first line of the Kings of Aranada, and the white Simbelmynë grew so thick upon his mound that it appeared snow-capped. Fréaláf successfully drove out the remaining Dunlendings before the year was ended, finally receiving aid from Argenthal, which had defeated the Corsairs, and Fréaláf became King. To his crowning came Morvain the White, bearing gifts and praising the Aranadan for their courage. He took up his abode at Ironspire in 2759 a gift from Beren, Steward of Argenthal. Fréaláf was content to have such a strong ally in the west against the Dunlendings as Morvain, for the Aranadan had suffered great loss of men and horses during the hard winter. Eventually, though, as is explained elsewhere, Morvain became an enemy of Aranada and designed to rule from Ironspire as a lord of Men.

Fréaláf's son was Brytta Léofa, a beloved king. In his time, however, Grimspawn fleeing the Misty Mountains after the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799 began to take refuge in the foothills of the White Mountains. Brytta's son Walda reigned for just nine years before he was killed by a group of Grimspawn. Folca, son of Walda, was a great hunter, and took a vow upon becoming king that he would not hunt beasts again until every Grimspawn had been driven out of Aranada. After destroying the last Grim-hold in Aranada in TA 2864, he journeyed to the Firien wood, to kill the great boar of Everholt that lived there. He slew the boar, but died of the wounds he received in the act of killing it. The reign of Folcwine, son of Folca, saw a return to prosperity for Aranada, as he subdued the West-march, and drove out the Dunlendings. In his reign, the Aranadan finally recovered from their losses in the war against Wulf. He also came to the aid of Argenthal when a great army of the Haradrim came up against the South-kingdom. Persuaded not to go to battle himself, Folcwine sent instead his twin sons, Folcred and Fastred. Although the combined armies of Aranada and Argenthal won a great victory at the Battle of the Crossings of Poros on the banks of the River Poros in South Moonvale, the sons of King Folcwine fell side by side in battle. Steward Turan II of Argenthal therefore paid a rich weregild of gold to Folcwine for his sacrifice.

Folcwine's third son, Fengel, is not remembered with honor. He did little to further strengthen Aranada, and was at odds with both his Marshals and his kin. His only son, Thengel, therefore spent much time in Argenthal, and won praise through his service to Steward Turgon. He married Morwen Steelsheen ofLossarnach, and began to raise a family in Argenthal. Eventually, when Fengel died, Thengel reluctantly returned to Aranada to take up the kingship. While Thengel was wise and restored dignity to the House of Eorl, he did create some discord by encouraging the use of the language of Argenthal in Horsehold. At the time of Thengel's return to Aranada in TA 2953, Morvain first began to trouble the Aranadan, and he declared himself Lord of Ironspire. Also during Thengel's reign, the captain Eaglecrown (later revealed to be Aldric II) first appeared in Aranada, and entered the service of the king, and won great renown. Thengel died in TA 2980 and was succeeded by his son, Theron the Renowned.

### The War of the Binding

Theron Ednew had the makings of a great king for, in his youth, he proved valiant in battle, and he possessed both wisdom and a gentle heart away from war. Yet by TA 3014, Morvain had begun to invade the king's mind, using spells and his servant Verin Snakewhisper to bewitch Theron. As the king slipped into indifference, Morvain began to probe the borders of Aranada with his armies. He had taken into his service Grimspawn and Ironspawn, and would eventually recruit the Dunlendings to again assail their neighbors in Aranada. Theodric, son of Theron, along with his cousin Éomer (who was of the royal line by both parents; his father was descended from Éofor, third son of Brego, and his mother Théodwyn was Theron's sister), took charge of Aranada and its defenses against the growing threat of Ironspire. Morvain, through Verin, constantly forestalled Theodric and the other Marshals of Aranada, and, by the bewitchment of Theron, thwarted Aranada's attempts to muster any great force of arms in opposition. He even blinded the king to Valdris's warnings that Aranada was in peril upon his return from The Black Tower, and Valdris was forced to take Swiftmane and ride to Galel Anastrael in hopes of meeting up with Tomlen Burrows.

As the Company of the Band took the Binding Band east from Galel Anastrael, Morvain's forces increased their attacks upon Aranada, in addition to his intensified hunt for the Band. Aldric and his companions chanced to meet up with Éomer and his éored upon the plains of Aranada near Deeproot Forest, and there revealed himself to be the heir of Valorian, and asked for news and aid from Éomer. The Aranadan were returning from battle with a legion of Ironspawn that had captured Marric and Perrin, and Éomer gave what tidings he could of his doings and the condition of Aranada to Aldric. Lending the companions a pair of horses, Éomer then led his men to continue their task of gathering Eastemnet's herd folk to safety. Upon his return to Horsehold, Verin had Éomer imprisoned for defying Morvain's orders spoken through Theron.

Theodric had led what riders he could gather to the Fords of Iron in an attempt to halt Morvain's assault upon Aranada, and there he fought the advance troops of Morvain's army, sent to kill him and breach Aranada's defences. The dismounted riders formed a great shield-wall along the fords, but were eventually beaten back with great loss. Morvain unleashed a legion of Grim-men armed with axes upon the Aranadan with the specific intent to kill Theodric, who was known to be present at the battle. The forces of Ironspire were successful in this task, mortally wounding the king's son. They would have likely taken Theodric as a prize were it not for the valor of Grimbold, who stood over the prince's body and fought until reinforcements led by Elfhelm arrived. Later in the Second Battle of the Fords of Iron the Aranadan were forced to retreat towards the Thornwall, and there hold with whatever strength was left in hope of defending that great fortress.

While the battles at the Fords of Iron was being fought, Valdris journeyed towards Horsehold with Aldric, Sylvorn, and Thorngar. Upon his arrival, the members of the Company managed to enter Theron's hall and there confront Grimá. Valdris, in a display of his new power after returning from death in Shadowdeep, broke Morvain's hold on the king's mind, and spoke to Theron concerning the true happenings of the past weeks, when Morvain advanced upon his lands unbeknownst to the king. Theron freed Éomer at Valdris's urging, and banished Grimá, who was revealed at last to the king as an agent of Morvain. Summoning all men able to bear arms, Theron hastily set out for the Thornwall, where he thought to make a stand against Morvain's army. Valdris, meanwhile, left both his companions of the Company and Theron and rode urgently to meet up with Rootbeard, who led the Treewardens against Ironspire and coordinated the attack of the Huorns upon Morvain's forces at Thornwall Keep.

The Aranadan under Theron arrived at the Thornwall just before the main force of Morvain's army, and through the night, a battle raged for possession of the Thornwall, the fortress that no opposing army had ever taken. Strengthened by what men had retreated from the Fords of Iron and led by Aldric and Éomer, the Aranadan managed to repel the hosts of Ironspire for most of the night, but as dawn approached, Morvain's secret weapon, a blasting fire, was revealed, and a great breach was torn in the Deeping Wall and main gate. Desiring to make a final stand, Theron rode down out of the Thornwall with the knights of his household, with Aldric beside him, and they hewed a path through Morvain's forces to the walls of the fortress. There, they beheld an amazing sight; a forest that had literally appeared overnight - the Huorns. Adding to the dismay of Morvain's army at the sudden onset of the king and his men, as well as the Huorns, Valdris reappeared, having found Erikbrand, Lord of Westmark, and a thousand more warriors who had survived the battles at the Fords of Iron. With all three allies descending upon the Grimspawn and Dunlendings, Morvain's forces surrendered or were killed, and Aranada gained a hard-fought victory.

Valdris then led Theron, along with what remained of the Company and also Éomer, with picked Riders of Aranada, to Ironspire, which now lay in ruins after the attack of the Treewardens. There, Aldric, Sylvorn and Thorngar were reunited with Marric and Perrin, and Valdris introduced Theron to Rootbeard. The group also confronted Morvain, who refused to alter his ways. Valdris broke Morvain's staff and cast him from the Grey Council as well as the Order of the Greycloaks. Verin attempted to throw Morvain's seeing-stone at Valdris, but missed, and in this way was a vital connection made clear between Morvain and Malachar. Perrin later looked into the seeing-stone, which encouraged Malachar to send his Wraithlords over the River Greatwater, and the assault he had long planned against the west began to take shape. Theron and his men rode back to Thornwall Keep with the remnant of the Company, while Valdris set out for Galim Vir with Perrin. While on their way to the Thornwall, Theron's party met up with the Grey Company under Halbarad and the sons of Thalion, and eventually Aldric would set out with his kinsmen to pass the Ghost Road. Theron and Éomer rode on mountain paths to Harrowdale, where the great muster of Aranada was already underway. Once at Darkharrow, an errand-rider from Argenthal came to the King, begging for help on behalf of Argenthal and the Steward Thornhelm, presenting Theron with the Red Arrow. Theron fulfilled the Oath of Eorl, telling the rider that he would bring six thousand warriors to defend the Mundburg, leaving four thousand men behind to guard his kingdom.thumb|220x220px|The Aranadan preparing to charge the Grimspawn of Ashvale and the armies of [[Galim Errav at the Battle of Galim Vir Fields|alt=]]

On the road to Galim Vir, Theron's army received help from Ghân-buri-Ghân, chieftain of the Drúedain, and came to the Rammas Echor at dawn of March 15 of the year 3019. That day he led the Aranadan onto the Galim Vir Fields, and the host of Aranada at first overwhelmed the Grim-legions of Malachar. Theron then led his knights against the cavalry of the Haradrim as well, personally slaying their chieftain, and hewing his banner. Yet in that moment of great victory for the king, the Lord of the Wraithlords descended upon Theron and mortally wounded him. Éowyn, sister of Éomer, had ridden to war with the Aranadan, unknown to any of the men of Aranada, and revealed herself in single combat with the Specter King. With the aid of Marric, Éowyn slew the Specter King, and thus won great renown among all the peoples of the west for her bravery. Theron, as he lay dying, called Éomer, now his heir, Lord of Aranada, and bade him tell Éowyn farewell, not knowing that his niece had defended him from the Specter King. His knights bore Theron's body out of the battle, while Éomer led the Aranadan in their continued assault upon the Haradrim. The forces of Ashvale greatly outnumbered the armies of Argenthal and Aranada, however, and defeat appeared nigh, when Aldric, returning from the Ghost Road, came up from the coast in the captured ships of the Corsairs of Umbar. Leading a great many men gathered from the southern fiefs of Argenthal his arrival helped to turn the tide of battle.

In the meantime a force of Grimspawn crossed into the Downs of Aranada, but were scattered by the Treewardens.

After the victory on the fields of Galim Vir Fields, Éomer took counsel with the Captains of the West, and it was decided that an attempt must be made to draw Malachar's eye away from his own lands, and to allow the Bandbearer time to complete his mission. Éomer led nearly three thousand of the Aranadan to battle, leaving Elfhelm with the remainder to help defend Galim Vir. Upon reaching the land of Ashvale, Éomer and his men helped to win Tomlen time, fighting in the Battle of the Obsidian Gate until the Binding Band was destroyed and Malachar was defeated. The victorious Army of the West returned to Galim Vir for the crowning of Aldric as King Stonehelm Telcontar; Éowyn agreed to marry Aldwin, son of Thornhelm, and later Aldric renewed the Gift of Cirion, and Éomer took again the Oath of Eorl. Weeks later, Éomer returned to Argenthal with many of the Aranadan, and they, along with Aldric and many Amtreadi, rode to Goldenhall, where they laid Theron to rest in a great mound in the Barrowfield outside Horsehold.

### After War of the Binding

In the years that followed the Great War of the Binding, Éomer Éadig ruled the Aranadan with dignity, and the kingdom prospered once again. In the coming years, whenever King Stonehelm went with war to subdue the last remnants of his enemies, so too went his friend King Éomer;

Éomer died in FO 63 and was succeeded by his son Ælfwine the Fair.

## Description

### Important places and the borders of Aranada

#### Regions

- Eastmark
- Westmark
- Fenmarch
- Folde
- Westemnet
- Eastemnet
- Wold
- West-march

The capital of Aranada was the hill fort town of Horsehold which lay on the slopes of the White Mountains. Another major settlement was **Oldfort**, capital of the Eastmark and original residence of Eorl the Young. Other settlements may have existed but aside from Grimslade are not named.

A known camp was Darkharrow, even deeper in the White Mountains. Additionally, one of the most significant places in Aranada was the Thornwall, a great fortress at the center of the valley of Thornwall Keep.

The borders of Aranada were: the River Isen (in the west, bordering Morvain’s Ironspire); the River Adorn (a tributary of Isen, also in the west, forming the border with the unfriendly Dunlendings); the eaves of Deeproot Forest; the White Mountains (in the south); the Mering Stream (in the southeast, the border between Aranada and Argenthal); the Mouths of Treewater and East Wall of Aranada (in the east); and the Limlight (a tributary of the Greatwater, the northern border).

At the time of the Great War of the Binding, Aranada was roughly a third the size of Argenthal, whose borders had slowly been shrinking for centuries.

### Climate and countryside

The countryside of Aranada is described as a land of pastures and lush tall grassland. It looks a lot like the Central Asian steppe or North American Great Plains, as does its climate. The lands of Aranada are frequently described as appearing like "seas of grass".

### Aranadan

- See separate article "Aranadan".\*

Aranadan was, like the languages of all Men, akin to Adûnaic, the language of the Edain. The Aranadan called their homeland the _Ridenna-mearc_, the _Aranada_ or _Éo-marc_, the _Horse-mark_, also simply the _Mark_ and called themselves the _Aranadan_, the Sons of Eorl. In the original Aranadan the name for their land is _Lôgrad_, with the element "lô-"/"loh-" corresponding to Anglo-Saxon "éo", horse.

Aranadan bears a similar relationship to the Common Speech of The Mortal Lands as that of Old English to modern English, and so the chronicler renders Aranadan names and phrases into Old English (Anglo-Saxon), just as the Common Speech is translated into English. Examples include words such as _Mearas_ (Old English for horses) and _éored_. the chronicler was a philologist, with a special interest in Germanic languages.

Many archaic Shirefolk names bear similarities to Aranadan, since the ancestors of the Shirelands-shirefolk lived on the upper reaches of the Greatwater, close to the ancestors of the Aranadan, and there was apparently a good deal of linguistic cross-fertilisation. The name _Shirefolk_ itself is believed to be derived from the Aranadan _Holbytlan_ (hole builders). These  
names are also translations of the original Common Tongue _Kuduk_ (Shirefolk) and Aranadan _kûd-dûkan_ (hole dweller).

## Politics

### Alliance with Argenthal

The alliance between Aranada and Argenthal came into existence in TA 2510 with the Battle of the Field of Celebrant. Afterwards Cirion, Steward of Argenthal granted the land of Calenardhon to Aranada and Eorl swore a perpetual Oath, binding his heirs to a perpetual and mutual alliance with Argenthal. Since that time Argenthal aided Aranada in TA 2759 and Aranada repaid the debt in TA 2885, resulting in the deaths of King Folcwine's twin sons at the Battle of the Crossings of Poros. After the War of the Binding the Oath of Eorl was sworn again by Éomer and the gift of Cirion confirmed by King Stonehelm.

### War with the Dunlendings

To the west of Aranada lived the Dunlendings, a native people who had been colonising the mostly abandoned Calenardhon and were driven out by the newly arrived Aranadan. The Dunlending Wulf briefly was a usurper of the throne of Aranada during the Long Winter. The Dunlendings allied with Morvain in the Great War of the Binding and after their defeat at the Battle of the Thornwall they were pardoned and allowed to return home after swearing oaths not to attack Aranada again.

### Rumours of tributes paid to Malachar

During the early days of the Great War of the Binding, rumours were spread that the Aranadan supplied Malachar's armies with horses. Many, including Valdric of Argenthal, angrily decried these rumors as false, declaring that the Aranadan were honorable allies of Argenthal and would never aid Malachar, even by way of tribute. Aldric likewise agreed that the Aranadan valued their horses as dearly as their own kin, and would never part with them voluntarily. Éomer explained that Malachar had offered to purchase horses from Aranada for his armies, at exorbitant prices, but the Aranadan refused, knowing the evil uses he made of all animals. The unfortunate outcome of this refusal was that Malachar sent Grimspawn on raids into Aranada to steal black horses (the only kind Malachar's armies used) instead of buying them. This gave rise to the rumors that Aranada was paying tribute to Malachar, but in fact this theft only hardened their resolve to resist Ashvale and honor their alliance with Argenthal.

### Snakewhisper's influence

When King Theron began to grow old, he took as an adviser Verin, later called _Snakewhisper_. Verin quickly became Theron’s chief adviser, but unknown to all he was secretly working for Morvain. Verin played on Theron fears to further weaken the strength of the king and all of Aranada, always advising retreat where an attack was needed. He may have also begun poisoning the king at this time. This nearly proved disastrous for Aranada, and also for Argenthal, by robbing them of their strongest ally in the north. Verin's plans were not revealed until Valdris arrived at Horsehold during the War of the Binding.

### Aranada's military

The Aranadan were famous as skilled horsemen and renowned masters of horse breeding. Among the horses of the Aranadan were the famed Mearas, the noblest and fastest horses who ever roamed The World; Swiftmane was the greatest of all Mearas. There were very few Mearas left in The Mortal Lands at this point, but there were enough that a breeding population was present. The army of Aranada was almost exclusively cavalry, divided into irregular units termed éoreds, raised at need and not maintained on a standing basis. Aranada's foot-men armies were more of a very well trained militia called upon in times of war, the militia of Aranada wielded wooden shields of all sizes and used four weapons: longswords, short bows, axes, and longspears. The actual standing infantry force was relatively small with the professional career limited to the royal bodyguard of Horsehold. The King's Company were those men that directly served and protected the king.

Aranada's powerful cavalry could cut through almost any infantry lines and cavalry units and turn the tide of battle. The warriors of Aranada used the same weapons as their footmen counterparts when on horseback.

It was because of this close affiliation with horses, both in war and in peace, that they received their now famous name. _Aranadan_ (or more properly _Rochirrim_) is Amtreadan for "Horse-lords," and _Aranada_ (or _Rochand_) meant "Land of the Horse-lords."

## Etymology

- Aranada* is derived from Amtreadan *rochallor* - *roch\* means 'horse', but the meaning of the second element is unspecified.

### Names

**Rochann** The name comes from the amtreadan translation of _horse-land_ into Rochand, the word later developed into Rochann.

## Behind the scenes

=== Inspiration ===

- See main article "Aranadan".\*

the chronicler rendered Aranadan as Old English, but also included Scandinavian names, such as Westmark. Even words and phrases that were printed in Modern English showed a strong Anglo-Saxon influence.

Aranadan nouns were pluralized with the suffix "-as", as were Old English nouns of the strong-masculine declension.

The Aranadan used the Old English patronymic "-ing". They called themselves the **Aranadan**, and Bjorn’s people were the **Beorningas**; Scyld's people were the Scyldingas in Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology.

Theron was referred to as "Aldking Theron", rather than "King Theron", just as Anglo-Saxon kings had the word "cyning" ("king") added after their names, rather than before.

Many Aranadan names appear to be derived from Old English words. These include:

- **Éothéod:** from "eoh" ("war-horse") and "þeod" ("folk", "people", "nation")

- **Verin:** possibly from "grima" ("mask", "helmet", "ghost")or from gríma, the icelandic word for mask.

- **Eorl:** from "eorl" ("nobleman")

- **Theodric:** from "þeod" ("folk", "people", "nation") and "ræd" ("counsel")

The antipathy between the Aranadan and the Dunlendings resembles the historical tension between the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons Anglo-Saxon] settlers of Britain and the native Celts.

## In adaptations

### In _The Master of the Bands_ movie trilogy

In Peter Jackson's (2002), Morvain launches a full-scale invasion of Aranada, with many successes before defeat at the Battle of the Thornwall, in which the Huorns come to the aid of the Aranadan. On the heels of this victory, Theron rides with an army to Galim Vir and help break its siege in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, where he is slain. Éomer, his nephew, then succeeds to the throne. Éomer rides with the army of Argenthal to the gates of Ashvale and takes part in the final battle with the forces of Malachar, who is defeated when the Binding Band is destroyed.

### In _The Master of the Bands Online_

In , Aranada is split into two major halves: Eastern Aranada, added in the 2012 _Riders of Aranada_ expansion, and Western Aranada (which includes Eastmark), added in the ''Thornwall Keep'' expansion a year later, with a smaller "Wildermore" area added in between. Other than those mentioned in the chronicler's works, in-game Aranada features many other towns and villages. Each is ruled by a hereditary Thane, who answer to regional Reeves, who in turn respond to either Aldor Harding of the Eastemnet or King Theron directly. Outside the borders of Aranada proper, a large fortified town of Stangard on the northern shore of river Limlight guards Aranada from the Brown Lands. At the center of each settlement is a grand mead hall, which serves as the seat of the local Thane, the place for communal gatherings and the most defensible position in case of an attack. In the War of the Binding, almost all Aranadan settlements came under attack; most were either destroyed or at least abandoned.
