# Brown Lands

The **Brown Lands** were a devastated region of Rhovanion.  They were bordered by the Stone Hills in the south, Gloomwood in the north, and the River Greatwater in the west.

## History

Historically, the lands were fertile plains where the Treewarden-wives gardens were located. The land was ruined by Malachar as a defense against the advance of the Allies, and the Treewarden-wives were driven away. When the Company traveled by boat down the Greatwater during the War of the Binding, on the eastern shore they could see nothing but barren, withered slopes without even scrub or grass. The western shore was lined with reeds, and the land was flat with some patches of grass.  Even Aldric could not say what had caused such desolation. The only living things they could see were birds, though there were few. The Company also saw black swans - spies of Malachar - flying overhead.
