# Trollshaws

The **Trollshaws** were the upland woods, lying west of Galel Anastrael between the rivers Hoarwell and Loudwater in eastern Eriador. Stonelurks roamed these lands, and terrorized trespassers. It consisted partly of beech trees.

## History

During the great days of Arnor, the eastern sub-kingdom of Rhudaur built fortified dwellings and castles here, but largely because of the wars with Angmar, the area became deserted of men and dangerous to travel through. By the late Third Era, they were infamous for being the haunting place of stonelurks, mainly Hill-stonelurks that had travelled down from the Ettenmoors. Three of these stonelurks were famously renowned for waylaying Jasper Burrows and his company of Forgekin, as they set out for the Ironpeak. These particular stonelurks, Tom, Bert, and William, were turned to stone on a ridge at the coming of dawn and were encountered many years later by Tomlen Burrows and company on their way to Galel Anastrael.
