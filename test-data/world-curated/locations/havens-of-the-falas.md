# Havens of the Falas

**Havens of the Falas** (called **Havens of Harborel** by Voronwë) were the two great walled Amtreadi cities: **Eglarest** at the mouth of the River Nenning, and to the north **Brithombar** at the mouth of the River Brithon. Built on the western shores of the Falas, the Havens were the realm of Harborel the Shipwright and his people, the Falathrim, who were considered Liinadi.

The Havens were besieged during the First Battle of Westlands, but during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath the Grimspawn that besieged the cities turned north to fight the Amtreadi and were all slain.  When Finoran Felagund established himself in Deephold his rule extended over all of West Westlands excepts for the coasts, which continued to be ruled by Harborel, Felagund's ally. Thanks to the alliance between the Falathrim and the Amtreadi of Deephold, the Havens were built as fair towns and fortified behind great walls.

The Havens of the Falas held out during the later Battles of Westlands until they were finally destroyed in , and Harborel's people fled to the Mouths of Sirion and the Isle of Balar.
