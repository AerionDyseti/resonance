# Nevrast

**Nevrast** was a region in West Westlands at the coast of the Belegaer in The Mortal Lands, during the years before the end of the First Era.

## Description

Nevrast was a depression surrounded completely by the Ered Wethrin. It was made up of over three-hundred square miles of land consisting of mostly scattered woodlands except for the marshland area encircling Linaewen. The climate was mostly a humid one with mild winters possibly due to the warm and moist prevailing winds that blew in from the sea.

## History

Nevrast was the centre of an Amtreadi kingdom of Turgon for about a hundred years, when its  people began moving to their newly completed realm of Hidden City. Turgon's capital (and it seems the only city of Nevrast) was Vinyamar. The land was not permanently inhabited after that, and indeed was utterly abandoned until Tuor came there, guided by Ulmo.

Nevrast was the first part of Westlands the Ñoldor settled, but was previously inhabited by Liinadi. Its population was soon very mixed, far more so than any other region of Westlands.

## Etymology

In Amtreadan, ***Nevrast*** means "Hither shore", from *nev* ("hither") and *rast* ("shore").

## Other forms of the legendarium

Its early and rejected name was ***Nivrost***: "the West Vale" in the Doriathrin language.
