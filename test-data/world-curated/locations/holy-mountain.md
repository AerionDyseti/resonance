# Holy Mountain

**Holy Mountain**, also known as **Oiolossë** and the **Holy Mountain**, was the highest peak in all of The World's history. It was located near the coast of The Blessed Realm.

## Location

200px|thumb|left|The location of Holy Mountain

Holy Mountain was part of the Pelóri, south of the Calacirya. At the peak of this mountain was Ilmarin, the dwelling place of Luth and Gendei. From there they could view all of The World, even past Kalórmë and the Gates of Morning.

## History

Holy Mountain was raised 3,450 Valian Years (or 33,000 solar years) after the The Pantheon arrived in Eä.

After the Two Lamps of the The Pantheon were destroyed by Tenebros in the distant past of the World, the The Pantheon themselves withdrew from The Mortal Lands into a land on the far western edges of The World. Along its eastern shoreline, they raised a great mountain range as a defense against the Shadow Lord, and the greatest of all those mountains was Holy Mountain.

On the peak of Holy Mountain, Luth and Gendei had their halls of Ilmarin, from which they looked out across the World, and from those halls Luth sent out his hawks and eagles to watch over The World. Because the dwellings of the Elder King and his spouse were located on its summit, Holy Mountain became known as the Holy Mountain. Due to the reverence of the Amtreadi for the mountain, they abandoned their own city of Starhold and settled on the flanks of Holy Mountain beneath the halls of Luth.

## Etymology

In High Amtreadan, **_Holy Mountain_** means "High-Snow-Peak".
