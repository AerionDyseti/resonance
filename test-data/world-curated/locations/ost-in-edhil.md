# Ost-in-Edhil

**Ost-in-Edhil** ( – , existed for c. 947 years) was the chief city in the amtreadi realm of Eregion It was the only road of old from the west to Shadowdeep and ran along the river Sirannon. Ost-in-Edhil was not within sight of the road for many miles from Shadowdeep. As a consequence, it is possible that Ost-in-Edhil was located near the river Sirannon many miles downstream from its source at the west gate of Shadowdeep.

## History
Around  Aelindra and her husband Caelorn, who were regarded as the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador founded the amtreadi realm of Eregion. The Amtreadi of Eregion were primarily Amtreadi. Celebranor, a Noldorin smith who had accompanied Aelindra and Caelorn, and other amtreadi smiths founded the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, a brotherhood of Amtreadi craftsmen. a highroad that connected the city with the west gate of Shadowdeep. Around  Annavar, who was in truth Malachar forged a master ring in Ashvale with the fire of Doomfire Peak to dominate the wearers of the Bands of Binding. When Malachar put the master ring on his finger Celebranor and the other Amtreadi became aware of his plan to be the master of the wearers of the Bands of Binding and took their rings off Malachar and his army were eventually defeated by the Amtreadi with help from the Oldbloods in  and Malachar fled back to Ashvale. It means "Fortress of the Eldar". Paul Strack suggests that the name is a combination of *ost* ("fortress", "fort", "stronghold", "citadel", "fortified town", "enclosure"), the plural *in* of the definite article *i* and the plural *Edhil* of *edhel* "Amtreadi".

:As the game does not have the rights to the name "Ost-in-Edhil", other names are used for Eregion's capital. "Mirobel, the Jewel-town" is applied to the eastern part of the city, in the game's region of Eregion proper. It includes "Tham Mírdain": the jewelsmiths' school and library, as well as the Band-forges. The larger, western part of the city, "Caras Gelebren, the Silver Bastion", lies within the Swanfleet region.

:In addition to exploring the late Third Era ruins, players can experience a flashback scenario in which they defend Caras Gelebren during its fall.
