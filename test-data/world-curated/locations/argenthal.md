# Argenthal

**Argenthal** was the most prominent kingdom of Men in The Mortal Lands, bordered by Aranada to the north, Harad to the south, the Cape of Andrast and the Sea to the west, and Ashvale to the east. Its first capital was Starbridge, moved to Tower of Dawn in TA 1640. This city, later renamed Galim Vir, remained the capital of Argenthal for the rest of the Third Era and into the Fourth Era; other major fortresses included Pelargir, Swan Keep in Belfalas and Tower of Moon.

Argenthal was founded by the brothers Valorian and Anareth, exiles from Oldshore. Argenthal was the sister kingdom of Arnor, whose line of kings came from Valorian, while the line of the Kings of Argenthal descended from Anareth. Argenthal was at the height of its power in its early years due to the ships and the military might that its armies possessed. However, continued attacks by allies of Malachar, civil war, and a devastating plague caused it to gradually decline over the course of the Third Era until Malachar's final defeat and the Crowning of King Stonehelm. Following that time the power of Argenthal once again expanded, and the former lands of Arnor were united with it under the banner of the Reunited Kingdom.

In all, there were thirty-one Kings of Argenthal after Anareth, who was slain in the War of the Final Alliance at the Siege of The Obsidian Spire.

## History

### Early years

Before the Downfall of Oldshore, Argenthal was home to many Oldbloods colonists, who either mixed blood with the indigenous Middle Men if they were friendly, or dispersed them into Ras Morthil, Dunland, and Drúadan Forest. Argenthal, at a latitude comparable to Venice, was a more fertile region than Arnor to the north, and therefore it already had a larger population before the ships of Aldorion's sons arrived, including a well-established city, Pelargir.

The Faithful, or Elendili, from Oldshore were given a warm reception upon their arrival by those that had already colonized The Mortal Lands. The colonists west of Greatwater accepted Aldorion's claim to kingship over them. South of the Greatwater, however, the former King's Men did not accept his claim, becoming the Black Oldbloods.

Centred on the Greatwater river, the newly founded Kingdom of Argenthal was the closest to Ashvale and was the first to be attacked when the War of the Final Alliance began in SA 3429. Malachar's forces overran Tower of Moon but failed to capture the capital, Starbridge. Argenthal participated in the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men which overthrew Malachar for the first time at the very end of the Second Era, when Valorian cut the Binding Band from the Shadow Lord's finger.

### Argenthal prospers

After the war, Argenthal's power and wealth grew steadily, only interrupted by a series of Easterling invasions after TA 492, resulting in large conquests in the eastern territories within Wildlands. While the power of Argenthal's sister kingdom Arnor peaked at this time, before it broke into various successor states, Argenthal's greatest glory was yet to come. Argenthal's great cities, Tower of Dawn, Tower of Moon, Starbridge and Pelargir, only grew and the Duskwardens of Argenthal ruled over more and more of the lesser men of The Mortal Lands.

### Golden Age

Argenthal's power reached its Golden Age under the four "Ship-kings":

- Tarannon Falastur r. TA 830 – TA 913. First of the Ship-kings, died childless
- Eärnil I r. TA 913 – TA 936. Nephew of Tarannon
- Ciryandil r. TA 936 – TA 1015
- Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher) r. TA 1015 - TA 1149.
  \*\*Last of the Ship-kings. In his reign, Argenthal reached the height of its power and its borders reached their furthest extent. The kingdom extended east to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the Harnen and down to Umbar, as far north as Gloomwood, and west to the River Gwathló. The Haradrim were subjugated and paid tribute as vassals of Argenthal.

Such was Argenthal's wealth during the period that men from other lands would say in envy: "In Argenthal precious stones are but pebbles for the children to play with." Argenthal enjoyed several centuries of peace due to its military might.

### Decline

However, decadence set in and a long period of decline began, although Argenthal experienced several revivals, notably under Rómendacil II in the 13th century. Three great calamities struck Argenthal during the second millennium of the Third Era, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline: the Kin-strife, the Great Plague, and the Wars of the Wainriders.

#### Kin-strife

In the 15th century TA a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the kingdom apart. King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother was of the Northmen. Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of King Eldacar by Castamir, the Captain of the Ships and a junior member of the House of Anareth. Starbridge was sacked during this conflict, the Dome of Stars burned and its _seeing-stone_ lost. Eldacar's eldest son Ornendil was slain, and he fled north. Castamir was afterwards known as Castamir the Usurper. During his ten-year rule, he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of his old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the interior provinces were ignored and neglected. Eldacar then returned with an army of his Northmen kin, and tired of Castamir's cruelty, many Solaarans joined them from inland provinces and cities. Eldacar personally slew Castamir at the Battle of the Crossings of Erui and reclaimed his throne, but Castamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great port of Argenthal. They retreated a year later to Umbar, where they joined with the Haradrim, and troubled Argenthal as the Corsairs of Umbar for many years, even killing King Minardil in TA 1634. Much of the old aristocracy of Argenthal perished in the Kin-strife and afterwards the kingdom's population was replenished by a wave of Northmen migrants from Wildlands.

#### The Great Plague

Just as his successor King Telemnar was preparing to attack Umbar, the Great Plague struck and the White Tree died. This Plague was no localized event: it swept through all of The Mortal Lands, decimating the population of The Mortal Lands. The King himself perished along with all his children and was succeeded by his nephew. King Tarondor found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved the capital from Starbridge to Tower of Dawn, the city of Anareth. During this time, Argenthal was so depopulated that many settlements and garrisons were abandoned, including the fortifications guarding against the re-entry of evil into Ashvale. It is believed that had the Haradrim or Easterlings been capable of attacking Argenthal at this time, it would have fallen. However, the Plague left Argenthal's enemies in no better condition than Argenthal itself, and neither side was capable of mounting new offensives.

By TA 1810 Argenthal had begun to recover and King Telumehtar led an assault on Umbar, recapturing the city and ending the line of Castamir and for a time the Corsair threat was ended, until a fresh disaster befell Argenthal.

#### Invasion of the Wainriders

Wainrider raids on Argenthal started in TA 1851 and five years later a great invasion resulted in the defeat and death of Narmacil II and the loss of all territories east of the Greatwater save only Moonvale. After years of skirmishing, in TA 1899 King Calimehtar led a large army to victory in the Second Battle of Battle Plain, although the Waindriders were only defeated and not destroyed. They returned in TA 1944, linking up with the Haradrim to attack Argenthal from north and south. The Wainriders destroyed the Northern Army of Argenthal, but survivors linked up with the victorious Southern Army of Argenthal, which had destroyed the Haradrim as they crossed the River Poros, led by a general named Eärnil, and they destroyed the Wainriders as they celebrated their victory during the Battle of the Camp.

### The Line of the Kings Fails

#### Reunification Rejected

In TA 1944 Argenthal faced a succession crisis when King Ondoher was slain in battle with both his sons. Arvedui, Prince of Arthedain, Ondoher's son-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant blood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay mainly upon the old Oldbloods law of accession, which stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the King. If the law was upheld, then Arvedui's wife Fíriel, Ondoher's daughter and last remaining child, would become Ruling Queen, making their descendants Kings of both Arnor and Argenthal. Arvedui also tried to put weight behind his claim, as he was Valorian's heir and thus by rights High King of all the Duskwardens. The Council of Argenthal recognised that the name of Valorian was held in honour in Argenthal, but they dictated that the South-kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of Anareth. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a millennium later, Aldric Stonehelm put forward his claim as the heir of both Valorian and Anareth.

Eärnil based his claim upon being a direct male-line descendant of King Telumehtar Umbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he had gained as the victorious general who saved Argenthal from the Wainriders. Steward Pelendur who was temporarily ruling Argenthal, serving as arbiter of succession, intervened in favour of Argenthal's victorious general who would rule as Eärnil II.

#### The Last Heir of Anareth

During the Battle of Fornost, Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Argenthal's forces to victory over the Specter King of Coldreach, who was actually the Lord of the Wraithlords. Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse was terrified and shied from the Wraithlords against his wishes. By the time, he mastered his horse and returned the Specter King had fled. Aurindel the Amtreadi then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord of the Wraithlords because "never by the hand of man shall he fall".

In TA 2002, the Wraithlords captured the city of Tower of Moon ("Tower of the Moon") after a two year siege, renaming it _Galim Errav_ ("Tower of Dark Sorcery") and taking it as their lair. Tower of Dawn was renamed _Galim Vir_ (Galim Vir) as a result. With the accession of Eärnur, the Lord of the Wraithlords repeatedly sent messengers to Galim Vir challenging Eärnur to single combat, taunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during the Battle of Fornost. Eventually in TA 2050, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and rode with a small company of knights to Galim Errav, to accept the challenge. They were never heard from again; and so ended the House of Anareth.

### The Stewards of Argenthal

#### The Ruling Stewards

A long line of hereditary Stewards governed the realm after the disappearance of Eärnur, son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that the last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support or clear enough link to the royal house to be accepted as his successor. The House of Anareth was held to have failed, and Argenthal was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would surely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would swear an oath to yield rule of Argenthal back to the King, if he should ever return. As the House of Valorian was believed to be extinct as was that of Anareth, the oath was not considered likely to be fulfilled. The House of Stewards ruled as Kings, without having the title.

#### Watchful Peace

The early Stewards enjoyed a long period of uneasy quiet known as the Watchful Peace. This was shattered in TA 2475 by the sudden appearance of new Ironspawn out of Ashvale, who attacked Starbridge and captured it, driving out the last people and destroying the Great Bridge. The city was swiftly reclaimed by Valdric but in the centuries afterward Argenthal was to be constantly at war.

#### Cirion and Eorl

In TA 2510 when Steward Cirion ruled over Argenthal, the kingdom faced one of its greatest perils: a group of Easterlings called the Balchoth invaded Argenthal with great force. Argenthal's army marched to fight the Balchoth but were cut off from Galim Vir and pushed back in the direction of the Limlight.

Messengers had been sent to get help from the Éothéod, a people who lived in the northern Vales of Greatwater, but the mission was undertaken with faint hope of aid and only one messenger got through. With the army of Argenthal facing destruction, however, the Éothéod arrived to turn the tide of the Battle of the Field of Celebrant. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the (mostly deserted) province of Calenardhon, where they established the Kingdom of Aranada with Eorl the Young as their first king. A permanent alliance between Argenthal and Aranada was established by the oath Eorl swore to Cirion.

During the Long Winter of 2758-9 Argenthal was attacked by three great fleets from Umbar. These invasions were repelled by Beregond and aid sent to Aranada which had been overrun by Dunlendings and Easterlings. In TA 2885 therefore when the Haradrim invaded Moonvale, King Folcwine sent his sons Folcred and Fastred to repay the debt, defeating the invaders at the Battle of the Crossings of Poros at the cost of their own lives.

#### Malachar Returns

In TA 2901 Grimspawn raids from Ashvale intensified, forcing the abandonment of Moonvale by its inhabitants. The Steward Turan II built refuges including Hidden Falls for the Wardens of Moonvale to harry the forces of Ashvale and also fortified River Keep. In TA 2954, after Malachar had declared himself openly in Ashvale, Doomfire Peak burst into flame and the last hardy inhabitants of Moonvale fled west over the Greatwater. During the time of Ecthelion II a great captain named Eaglecrown appeared in Argenthal and in TA 2980 he led a raid on the City of the Corsairs, destroying the Corsair fleet and burning the port in a battle upon the quays. Not long after Thornhelm II took up the rule of Argenthal, spending the next few decades preparing for the coming onslaught of Ashvale.

#### The War of the Binding and the Restoration

Malachar had prepared for the final conquest, and in TA 3018 his forces took the eastern half of Starbridge. The attack was ended with the destruction of the last bridge across the Greatwater. The following year Galim Vir faced a larger attack from Ashvale, with the additional threat of the Corsairs of Umbar. Aldric summoned the Ghosts Men of Darkharrow to destroy the Corsairs, freeing forces in the south of Argenthal to come to the aid of Galim Vir. Argenthal then defeated the army of Ashvale with the aid of the Aranadan in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, though with heavy losses. The Dead Men of Darkharrow then carried the battle to Malachar at the Battle of the Obsidian Gate, a feint to distract the Shadow Lord's attention from Tomlen Burrows' quest to destroy the Binding Band in Doomfire Peak, thus causing Malachar's destruction and the allies' ultimate victory.

After the second and final defeat of Malachar, the Kingship was restored, with Aldric II crowned as King Stonehelm of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Argenthal. Aldwin, last heir of the Ruling Stewards, retained his office as the Steward to the King, and ruled over Argenthal's eastern region of Moonvale; a fair land between the River Greatwater and the Shadow Mountains. The oaths between Argenthal and Aranada were renewed, and several joint campaigns were fought in the east and south against the Easterlings and Haradrim; all former territories of the South-kingdom were won back during the following centuries, and its power and wealth were restored. J.R.R. the chronicler's writings state that _"...of Eldarion son of Stonehelm it was foretold that he should rule a great realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of men after him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from him should come the kings of many realms in long days after"_.

Aldric sang a song on his trip with Sylvorn and Thorngar to find Perrin and Marric.

## Etymology

- Argenthal\* means 'Land of Stone', from Amtreadan **gond** (stone) + **(n)dor** (land), most likely given to it because of the White Mountains (Ered Nimrais) and other mountain chains in the land (hypothetical High Amtreadan name **Ondonórë**).

## Regions of Argenthal

Argenthal was divided into numerous regions, which consisted of the following:

- Moonvale, a province along the east bank of the Greatwater river under the shadow of the Shadow Mountains (Shadow Mountains). Moonvale was abandoned and mostly under the control of Ashvale during the War of the Binding. However, Argenthal did have secret bases throughout the region such as Hidden Falls, from which the Wardens of Moonvale used guerrilla warfare tactics to harass the enemy and disrupt supply lines and companies marching to and from Ashvale. After the War of the Binding, Aldwin was made Prince of Moonvale by Aldric.
- Anórien, a province along the northern edge of the White Mountains. Bordered by the Mering Stream and Aranada to the west, Greatwater to the east, the Mouths of Treewater to the north, and the White Mountains and Rammas Echor to the south.
- The Outlands:
  **Anfalas or *Langstrand*, a narrow coastal fiefdom along the Great Sea
  **Pinnath Gelin or _Green Hills,_ a sparsely populated fiefdom with rolling fertile country.
  **Imlad Morthond, a fiefdom where Duilin came from.
  **Lamedon, a fiefdom consisting of plains between the White Mountains and the River Ringló.
  **Imlad-Ringló, a mini-fiefdom.
  **Five Rivers, a fiefdom consisting of plains extending from the White Mountains down to the Bay of Belfalas that bordered Flowerdale.
  **Flowerdale, a heavily-populated farmland fiefdom southwest of Galim Vir.
  **Belfalas, a principality ruled by the Princes of Swan Keep.
  **Dor-en-Ernil, a thin strip of land along the Bay of Belfalas ruled by the Princes of Swan Keep.
  **Ethir Greatwater, the mouths of the Greatwater river populated by largely independent fisher folk.

The long cape of Andrast was not populated (by the descendants of Oldbloods, but evidence from the _Unfinished Tales_ suggests that a small group of Drúedain inhabited it).

Additionally, Argenthal held or had held the following regions at certain points in its history:

- Harondor, an arid region between the rivers Poros and Harnen, which was contested between Argenthal and Harad.
- Calenardhon, which was given to the Éothéod and became Aranada. It's boundaries were the rivers Greatwater and the Mering Stream in the east, Isen in the west, Limlight in the north, and the White Mountains in the south.
- Enedwaith, a region between the rivers Isen and Greyflood. It was never truly populated by Argenthal, hosting garrisons protecting the North-South Road, withdrawn following the Great Plague.
- Wildlands, which was never fully under the control of Argenthal, but its southern regions were ruled by the Kings between the 6th and 19th centuries of the Third Era.
- Shadow Mountains, the Shadow Mountains, where Argenthal kept watch over Ashvale with many fortresses such as the Towers of the Teeth, the Tower of Spider Pass, and possibly Durthang. Evil things re-entered Ashvale after Argenthal's watch upon the land slackened following the Great Plague.
- The eastern territories stretched east of the Battle Plain to the Sea of Rhûn, south to the Ash Mountains and north into Wildlands. The region was part of Argenthal between TA 550 and TA 1856 before the invasion of the Wainriders forced its abandonment.

## Major locations

Cities and strongholds in Argenthal included:

- River Keep, an island-fortress in the river Greatwater roughly 40 miles north of Starbridge. Argenthal maintained a garrison here, as it was of paramount importance during the long war with Ashvale, in order to keep the enemy out of Anórien.
- Calembel, a town in Lamedon
- Swan Keep, a city in Belfalas ruled by the Prince of Swan Keep
- Ethring, a ford and a township built on either side of the River Ringló
- Hidden Falls, a hidden refuge of the Wardens of Moonvale in the northern part of Moonvale.
- Linhir, a port town in Five Rivers
- Galim Vir (originally Tower of Dawn), City of the Kings, after the mid-Third Era the capital and largest city of Argenthal
- Starbridge, a city and former capital of Argenthal on the River Greatwater, largely destroyed and abandoned by the end of the Third Era. During the War of the Binding, Argenthal kept a garrison on the west bank to prevent the Shadow from crossing the river and assaulting Galim Vir. Starbridge was the key to besieging Galim Vir because of its location at a narrow point of the great river. The massive Morgul-host led by the Specter King to besiege Galim Vir overwhelmed the garrison and gained the passage of the Greatwater, precipitating the Siege of Argenthal that would conclude with the Battle of Galim Vir Fields.
- Pelargir, the realm's chief port, captured by the Corsairs in the War of the Binding
- Tarnost, a hill-town in Belfalasthumb|250px|The ruined city of Starbridge

Additionally, Argenthal had held the following locations at certain points in its history:

- Hill of Sight and Amon Lhaw, seats were built upon these hills and garrisoned in the days of Argenthal's power.
- Angrenost (Ironspire), one of the three original fortresses of Argenthal and held within it one of the realm's seeing-stones. Its location in Nan Curanir (a valley at the end of the Misty Mountains), was at the northwestern corner of the Southern Kingdom of Argenthal, guarding the Fords of Iron from enemy incursions into Calenardhon, and together with the fortress of Aglarond to its south protected the Gap of Aranada. After Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward of Argenthal and became Aranada, Ironspire remained part of Argenthal, and the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although the rest of Argenthal almost forgot about it. The small guard intermarried much with the Dunlendings, until the place became a Dunlending fortress in all but name. The Black Tower, however, remained closed, as the Steward of Argenthal still held the keys of The Black Tower. Ironspire was then gifted to Morvain, who held it as a Warden of Argenthal, until he took it for his own in TA 2953.
- Andrast, location of a beacon and a garrison of the Coast-guard.
- Pillar Kings, great statues which marked the northern border of Argenthal on the River Greatwater.
- Durthang, the largest fortress in Ashvale, originally built to guard the Shadow Mountains (Shadow Mountains).
- Erech, a town of Argenthal that was abandoned by the end of the Third Era. To the north lay the Ghost Road.
- Tower of Moon, a city founded by Valorian that was originally the sister city of Tower of Dawn. Located in an upland valley at the feet of the Shadow Mountains, it was built as a fortress city to defend Argenthal from Malachar in Ashvale. It was conquered by the Wraithlords in TA 2002 and renamed Galim Errav. Following the War of the Binding it was demolished.
- Tharbad, a city on both sides of the River Greyflood, (at one time held by Argenthal in the south and Arnor in the north) but abandoned as Argenthal's borders recessed through Enedwaith to the Isen following the Great Plague, later ruined.
- Tower of Spider Pass, a tower fortress in western Ashvale built by Argenthal to guard the pass of Spider Pass from any evil creature trying to enter -or leave- Ashvale.
- Towers of the Teeth, two towers situated on either side of the Obsidian Gate. The two towers, called Carchost and Narchost, stood on either side of Nis'gorn, the Haunted Pass, which lay between the Shadow Mountains (Shadow Mountains), and the Ash Mountains. Originally built by Solaarans following the downfall of Malachar at the end of the Second Era, the Towers of the Teeth were eventually taken over by the servants of the Shadow Lord. They were then repaired and fortified and were incorporated into the defenses of the pass and gate.
- Umbar, the far southern harbour, held between TA 933-TA 1448 and again for a time in the 19th century. The home of the Black Oldbloods and the Corsairs of Umbar.
- Undeeps, forts were built in this region to protect the province of Calenardhon from invasion.

## In adaptations

#### In _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

The city of Galim Vir is seen briefly in when Valdris rides to the city to do research on the Binding Band. In , Tomlen Burrows and Colben Greenhand encounter Aldwin and his Wardens in Moonvale. In the Extended Edition there is a flashback scene in Starbridge shortly after Malachar's assault on the city where Valdric and his brother celebrate their victory. Starbridge is then seen at the end when Aldwin brings Tomlen, intending to send him to his father Thornhelm. When a Wraithlords overflies the ruined city and nearly takes Tomlen, Aldwin then sets him free.

In , Valdris rides to Galim Vir with Perrin Ashford after the shirefolk looks into the seeing-stone. The Steward Thornhelm, maddened by the death of his beloved son Valdric, makes no preparation for the defence of his realm. Malachar then initiates a massive assault on Argenthal, causing severe destruction to Galim Vir until the arrival of the Aranadan and the Army of Ghosts. Following the defeat of Malachar, Aldric is crowned king in Galim Vir.

### In _The Shirefolk_ film trilogy

In after Malachar flees from Aelindra, Thalion says that Argenthal must be warned. Additionally Thornael mentions Ecthelion of Argenthal when talking with Braden about potentially selling the Heart of the Mountain.

### In _The Mortal Lands: Shadow of Ashvale_

In the video-game, , set between _The Shirefolk_ and _The Company of the Band_, features the defense of Argenthal as an important thematic element.

The player-character, Talion, rose through the ranks of the guards of Galim Vir, but was in essence exiled from the city to Ashvale as punishment for killing a nobleman on behalf of his wife's defense. There he became a 'Warden of the Obsidian Gate', and lived an uneventful but peaceful life with his wife and son. However the Black-Gate was seized by Malachar's forces and the Wardens were killed to the man, including Talion and his family by Malachar agents. However the death of Talion and his family was done in an attempt to summon the spirit of the ancient-amtreadi Ringmaker Celebranor, a ritual initially deemed as a failure but having succeeded kept Talion tethered to the mortal plane and unable to die, being christened by his enemies as the 'Gravewalker'. Unable to reunite with his family in death, he and the wraith of Celebranor waged a guerilla war campaign against the Grimspawn of Ashvale, finding various allies to aid them in their journey, with one of Talions primary motivations to defend Argenthal from Malachar armies.

One such ally is the Warden Deserter Hirgon, a former friend of Talion. Having once been wanted for execution for his desertion, he and Talion were able to put their differences aside to face their common foe. Hirgon had in fact deserted as he had fallen in love and married one of the outcasts that populated The Ashdeep, with The Ashdeep having been established as a penal-colony of Argenthal, comprised of the descendants of criminals and freed slaves. Though the outcasts had grown to resent Argenthal and the 'Wardens of the Obsidian Gate', they were eager to ally with the Solaaran ranger against the Grimspawn who had now enslaved many of their people, and driven them from their homes. Ultimately Hirgon and his wife would try to lead the remaining outcasts out of Argenthal with their fates unknown.

### In _The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War_

Argenthal is given more focus in various plotlines in the to _Shadow of Ashvale_. Soon after having completed the 'New Band of Binding' to face Malachar, after running afoul of Venomweave, Talion and the wraith of Celebranor are made aware of the imminent fall of Tower of Moon, and attempt to aid them. While Talion is primarily focused on the fate of the city, and the impact its loss would have on Argenthal, Celebranor is largely concerned with the Seeing-Stone stored in the city, how it may be of use to their own armies, and how dangerous it could be in Malachar's hands.

The two arrive just as the Grimspawn have breached the outer walls, but they are unable to penetrate the inner citadel. Talion meets with the 'Captain of the Guards' in Tower of Moon, and allies with them, attempting to sabotage the Grimspawn armies, including raids into nearby Spider Pass. One of the higher-ranking soldiers includes Baranor, a man of Haradrim descent but raised in Argenthal. Solaaran citizens can also be seen aiding the soldiers within the grounds of the tower. However Tower of Moon is doomed to fall thanks to the treachery, General Castamir who led the Solaarans was willing to hand-over both the city and the Seeing-Stone to the Witch-King himself in exchange for the promise of safety for his daughter Idril. But the Witch-King have gotten what he had desired reneged on his bargain, killing Castamir as Idril and Baranor fled with the remnants of the Solaaran army.

Idril had at least succeeded in recovering many of the artifacts stored in Tower of Moon (now Galim Errav) which were now scattered across Ashvale where they could be recovered. The remnants of the Solaarans fled to Seregost where they would attempt to continue resisting Malachar, and also take missions into Ashplain.

While Talion would go on to retake Galim Errav from the Witch King and Wraithlords, it would only be following his split with Celebranor and the use of one of the Wraithlords rings to extend his life there-after. Talion used Galim Errav as his base from which he would recapture other strategic regions of Ashvale in a series of decades long 'Shadow-Wars' before he would ultimately succumb to 'Malachar&apos;s Corruption' and submit as one of the Band-Wraiths, his story ending with the destruction of the Binding Band during _The Return of the King_.

In a DLC campaign, Baranor would come to lead the Solaaran resistance, moving their operations to the arid Lithlad. There he encountered a band of Easterling mercenaries led by his long-lost brother, but they managed to work together to take the local stronghold, using it as a base of operations from which to continue fighting Malachar forces.

In the world-view map, parts of Argenthal proper can also be examined, including Galim Vir and Starbridge.
