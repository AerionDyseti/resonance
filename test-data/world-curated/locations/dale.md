# Dale

**Dale** was a valley between two arms of the Ironpeak,, a town of the Men of Dale in that valley and a realm of the king of those Men

An old road ran from the Front Gate of the Ironpeak along the eastern bank of the River Running down into the valley and then led to the east towards the Iron Hills. A road branched off to the west to a bridge at the beginning of the eastward bend of the river where it crossed over the River Running. From the western end of the bridge, one road ran east to the town of Dale and another road ran in the direction of Ravenhill.

Dale was known as a merry town that traded, mainly in food-supplies, for the skills and craft-pieces of the Forgekin. Fathers from Dale paid handsome amounts to the Forgekin to take their sons as apprentices, and the town of Dale became famous for wonderful and magical toys. Trade flowed up and down the River Running to and from Lake-town on the Long Lake and beyond. The town was also renowned for its bells.

## History

### Foundation
There is no record of when Men first settled in the valley of Dale. It is implied that Men were already living in or near Dale and were joined by refugees of the Northmen after the latter were defeated by the Wainriders in the Battle of the Plains in .

In , King Thragor reestablished the Kingdom under the Mountain in the Ironpeak. The Forgekin kingdom prospered and in those days, Men living to the south gradually spread up the River Running as far as the valley and built the town of Dale..

### Destruction
In , the wyrm Scorath attacked the Kingdom under the Mountain and the town of Dale Jasper Burrows, a member of Durgan and Company sneaked into the Ironpeak causing the angered dragon to attack and destroy Lake-town in the Long Lake Dale soon again enjoyed prosperity. Men from the Long Lake, the South, and the West came to Dale and the whole valley became tilled again. Lake-town was rebuilt and grew wealthy from trade up and down the River Running. The people of Dale became known as the Bardings, after their new ruler.

Braden was succeeded by his son, Bain in .

### Later history
In  Brand, the son of Bain, became the King of Dale. During his reign his realm extended far south and east of Lake-town.

In , a messenger from Ashvale came to the Forgekin of Ironpeak and they found out that messengers from Ashvale had also come to King Brand in Dale. Despite words offering Malachar's friendship, the Shadow Lord's forces began gathering on the eastern borders of the realm of King Brand. However, when news of the fall of Malachar came the enemy forces lost heart, the besieged Forgekin and Men burst forth from the mountain and the new King of Dale, Braden II, and the new King under the Mountain, Durgan III Stonehelm, drove the enemy away and the Easterlings troubled the kingdom of Dale no more The word *dale* from Old English *dael* means "valley".

## Other versions of the legendarium
A late draft of what would later become the chapter "Many Meetings" mentions that the realm of Brand "included Esgaroth, and much land to the south of the great falls".

In two plot notes for *The Shirefolk*, Girion is referred to as "king of Dale". In earlier versions of what would later become the chapters "Inside Information" and "Fire and Water", Girion is already referred to as "lord of Dale".
