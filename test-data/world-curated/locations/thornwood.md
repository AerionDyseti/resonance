# Overview

Thornwood is a modest city located in Kaldo Province. While not as significant as other urban centers in the region, it still features some notable architecture and serviceable marketplaces that support the local economy.

# Notable Locations

The city's most recognizable landmark is the Paladin's Guild Headquarters, though the facility is a shadow of the Guild's former grand halls that once stood in major cities.

# Geography

Situated near the eastern forests of Kaldo Province, Thornwood enjoys a temperate climate with moderate rainfall throughout the year. The city is built on gently rolling hills, with the central districts occupying the highest ground.

# Government & Politics

Thornwood operates under the governance of an elected council of merchants and nobles, who report to the provincial authority. The city maintains its own guard force separate from provincial military units, supplemented by the diminished protection of the Paladin's Guild.

# Economy

The city's economy is primarily based on local trade and traditional craftsmanship. Woodworking, as suggested by the city's name, remains an important industry, with Thornwood furniture and carvings being valued throughout the region. The presence of the Paladin's Guild provides some additional economic activity, though far less than in its glory days.

# Culture

Residents of Thornwood have mixed feelings about their city's connection to the Paladin's Guild. While some appreciate the protection and prestige it once brought, others view it as a faded institution. Small tournaments and festivals celebrating martial traditions continue, though they're modest compared to similar events in larger cities.

# History

Thornwood wasn't always the home of the Paladin's Guild Headquarters. As the Guild's influence and resources declined over the decades, they were forced to relocate from their grand halls in major cities to this more modest location. The move to Thornwood marked a significant turning point in the Guild's history, symbolizing its diminished standing in the realm.

While the Paladin's Guild no longer commands the respect and authority it once did, Thornwood gained historical significance as the birthplace of an adventuring party that would later go on to fain prominence as members of the Order of Bahameti, representing one of the few bright spots in Thornwood's otherwise unremarkable recent history.
