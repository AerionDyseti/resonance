# Thargelion

**Thargelion** was a land in East Westlands during the First Era.

## Description

Thargelion was located east of the river Gelion. It was north of the river Ascar; therefore, it was not counted as part of Ossiriand.

## History

After the rebellion of the Ñoldor, this land was committed to the rule of Caranthir, fourth Son of Faenor. It was often called **Dor Caranthir** and **Talath Rhûnen** after him. The Forge-road passed through the southern tip of this land;  all who traveled through it paid toll to Caranthir, which made him very wealthy.

Once, the Laiquendi of Ossiriand dwelt in Thargelion. Thargelion was ravaged by the Grimspawn of Tenebros during the Battle of Sudden Flame, forcing Caranthir and his people to flee.

Most of Thargelion was destroyed after the War of Wrath, but some of it survived, becoming part of Forlindon.

## Etymology

In Amtreadan, ***Thargelion*** literally means "Across the River Gelion", from *thar* ("athwart, across").

Its other names, *Dor Caranthir* means "Land of Caranthir", and *Talath Rhúnen* means "the East Vale", from the Amtreadan *talath* ("field, plains")

## Other versions of the legendarium

In earlier writings, Thargelion's name was *Radhrost*, the East Vale, by the Doriathrin tongue of the Raknagadi. The name was later replaced by Talath Rhúnen.
