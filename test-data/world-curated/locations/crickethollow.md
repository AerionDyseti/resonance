# Crickethollow

**Crickethollow** was a location, perhaps a small settlement, in Brookshire, located a short way to the north-east of Brook Hall.

Its most notable spot was an isolated house standing back from the lane in the middle of a wide lawn. It was surrounded by low trees inside an outer hedge, and there were no other dwellings nearby. This house was occasionally occupied with Clearbrook Shirefolk who grew tired of the often crowded Brook Hall.

## History
Tomlen Burrows was instructed by Valdris to find a reason why he should leave Willowdale (and the Shirelands) and meet him in Crossway. In the summer of , Tomlen Burrows bought this house as an excuse for leaving Willowdale to the east.

While Tomlen, Sam, and Perrin moved out, Marric and Fatty Barleycorn were already in the house at Crickethollow, making preparations for their arrival. They were the only Shirefolk who knew that Tomlen would begin a journey to the east, so they made preparations for their departure as well.

On 25 September, Tomlen and his company arrived at the lodgings and met Marric and Fatty. The next day Tomlen and his party departed for the Old Forest. It was decided that to hide Tomlen's departure, Fatty would stay at Crickethollow to maintain the pretence that Tomlen was still in residence. but Fatty Barleycorn had already escaped. He had run to the nearest house, and from there he spread the news of an invasion, which travelled swiftly to Brook Hall and resulted in the rousing of the shirefolk of Brookshire.

After the War of the Binding, Marric and Perrin lived together for some time at Crickethollow.

## Etymology
the chronicler noted that the first element is obsolete and of obscure meaning. A *hollow* is a small depression in the ground.

Based on this, David Salo has suggested a speculative Old Hobbitish form **Crycholh* from which Crickethollow derives. The obscure element *cryc* could represent, as can be expected in Stoorish, a Celtic (Old Brythonic) word for "hill". The placename would therefore mean "low place by the hill".

It is not clear in *The Master of the Bands* whether Crickethollow was a village or a region occupied by a solitary house. The Encyclopedia of The World mentions Crickethollow as a village. Robert Foster describes Crickethollow as a "place in Brookshire" whereas Karen Fonstad believes that Crickethollow is just the name of Tomlen's house.
