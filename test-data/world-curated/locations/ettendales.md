# Ettendales

The **Ettendales** was a region north of Galel Anastrael, contained within the Ettenmoors and adjacent to the Coldfells.

Aldric II Stonehelm knew the region to by inhabited by stonelurks during his time as a ranger, though he was otherwise unfamiliar with it.

## Etymology

***Ettendales*** literally means 'giant-valleys'. It is unclear if the location was in fact a home to giants.

- Etten* comes from the Old English *eoten*, meaning *Giant*.
