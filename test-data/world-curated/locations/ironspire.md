# Ironspire

**Ironspire**, also known as **Angrenost** ('Iron Fortress') in Amtreadan, was one of the three major fortresses of Argenthal, and held within it one of the realm's seeing-stones.

However, in the latter half of the Third Era, the stronghold came into the possession of the Wizard Morvain, becoming his home and seat of power until his defeat in the War of the Binding.

## Description

Ironspire was built in the Second Era around the tower of The Black Tower by the Oldbloods in exile, in the days of their power, in Nan Curanir (The Wizard's Vale) in the Misty Mountains. Its location was at the northwestern corner of the Kingdom of Argenthal, guarding the Fords of Iron from enemy incursions into Calenardhon and, together with the fortress of Aglarond to its south, protecting the Gap of Calenardhon.

Ironspire was comprised of a black, circular, stone-wall surrounding a broad plain, in the center of which was the Tower of The Black Tower. Ironspire had only one gate, which faced south.

The River Angren (or Isen) began at Methedras behind Ironspire, which also formed its northern wall. The other three sides were guarded by a large wall, known as the Band of Ironspire, which was only breached by the inflow of the River Angren at the northeast through a portcullis, and the gate of Ironspire at the south, at both shores of the river. The Gate was said to be able to open without a sound.

Ironspire was, at first, a green and beautiful tower complex, with many large trees and grass fields, fed by the river until it was dammed by Morvain. During his tenure as an opportunistic servant of Malachar, Morvain turned Ironspire into "a child's model or a slave's flattery" of Ashvale. Its gardens destroyed, the valley was covered in pits filled with forges and machinery needed for war. After the Wizard's defeat, however, Rootbeard and the rest of the Treewardens made it a vivid green area again, after destroying the walls and dam, renaming it the **Treegarth of The Black Tower**.

## History

In the centuries following the Great Plague the land of Calenardhon became depopulated, and the last Warden of The Black Tower was recalled to Galim Vir. Ironspire remained garrisoned by a small company, led by a hereditary captain, much as happened at Aglarond at the time. At first messengers were still sent to the fortress by the Stewards, although these dwindled and then eventually ceased entirely.

In TA 2510, after Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward of Argenthal, and became Aranada, Ironspire remained part of Argenthal, and the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although the rest of Argenthal had virtually forgotten it. The small guard intermarried much with the Dunlendings, until the place became a Dunlending fortress in all but name. The Black Tower, however, remained closed, as the Steward of Argenthal held the keys. Ironspire soon became all but deserted.

During the rule of Aranada's King Déor, in TA 2710, the line of hereditary captains commanding the fortress garrison died out and Ironspire became openly hostile to the Aranadan. Using Ironspire as their base, the Dunlendings continued to raid Aranada during the reign of Déor's son Gram, until during the rule of Gram's son Helmric Ironhand a Dunlending lord, Freca and his son Wulf nearly managed to destroy the Aranadan. The Aranadan led by Helm's nephew, Fréaláf Hildeson, eventually won, taking Ironspire by starving out the Dunlendings in TA 2759 and guarding it for Argenthal.

At this time, the Wizard Morvain the White suddenly reappeared from the East, and offered to guard Ironspire. The Steward of Argenthal, Beren, gladly gave him the keys to The Black Tower, and Morvain settled there. After him the valley became known as _Nan Curanir_, "Wizard's Vale". At first, the White Wizard was merely Warden of the Tower on behalf of Argenthal, but as his ambitions grew and fall began, he took the fortress for his own in TA 2953. Morvain fortified Ironspire and secretly troubled Aranada by aiding its enemies during Thengel's reign. Having become Malachar's servant by TA 3000, Morvain began building an army to "deliver" the Aranadan to his "dark master", though his true goal was to try claim the Binding Band for himself. At Ironspire, Morvain would create the Ironspawn, using the dark crafts he had studied to create a "perfected" subspecies of Grimspawn. These Ironspawn bred at Ironspire soon began making sorties with Grimspawn from the Misty Mountains and Ashvale into Aranadan territory. Morvain also tasked his agents in the Shirelands with procuring leaf-weed and other provisions and shipping them to Ironspire in preparation for war.

In TA 3018, Valdris came to Ironspire to take counsel with Morvain. It was then that the Grey Wanderer discovered his intentions and defection to the Shadow Lord's side. With Valdris refusing to either submit to Malachar or reveal the Band's whereabouts, Morvain imprisoned him on the pinnacle of The Black Tower. From there, the Grey Wanderer saw Ironspire's host amass. In the War of the Binding, the Isengarders now defiled Nan Curanir, cutting down its tree gardens and damming and diverting the Isen river. The valley was filled with deep caverns, housing forgeries and breeding pits for Grimspawn. After Valdris's escape from The Black Tower, Morvain sent both Uglúk's warband to hunt for the Company of the Band and raiding parties to ravage Aranada's Westmark. Failing to attain the Band, Morvain turned to seeking Malachar's clemency by marshalling his entire army of Ironspawn and Half-grimspawn, as well as the Dunlendings at Ironspire for a final attack against Theron's Aranadan at Thornwall Keep (in the game Master of the Binding: Rise to War, though this is not part of the chronicler lore, it is stated that an Ironspawn berserker, Ugthak, who was personally created by Morvain, led the assault on Thornwall Keep and broke its walls). While the Battle of the Thornwall unfurled, a host of Treewardens led by Rootbeard of Deeproot attacked Ironspire, wrecking the fortress, though The Black Tower remained intact. Morvain’s entire army of Grimspawn were slain by the Aranadan and by a host of Huorns who had joined the battle.

The Shirefolk Marric Clearbrook and Perrin Ashford, as the new "doorwardens", received Theron, Aldric, and Valdris at the gates. Morvain was confronted but refused to beg for pardon, and he was kept under Rootbeard's guard together with his footman, Verin Snakewhisper. It was planned by Malachar that Ironspire would be given to his ambassador, the Voice of Malachar, a far more trustworthy servant than Morvain. The Wizard nonetheless abandoned the stronghold after the downfall of his "dark master", playing off Rootbeard's hatred of caging any living thing in order to manipulate him into letting him leave.

### After the War of the Binding

Early in the Fourth Era, Ironspire was restored and Rootbeard replanted many trees. The Black Tower again became a tower of the Reunited Kingdom of King Aldric II Stonehelm.

Under the Treewarden dominion, the ring-wall was torn down and the Treewardens planted the **Watchwood** there, naming the new forest the "Treegarth of The Black Tower". Morvain's pits and caverns were filled, and the land was healed. The Valley was now filled with trees, and a small lake was constructed near The Black Tower. Nan Curanir was given to the Treewardens by Aldric, to do with as they wished, granted that they keep watch upon The Black Tower and prevent anyone without permission from entering.
