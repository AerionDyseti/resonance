# The Shirelands

**The Shirelands** was a country in northwestern The Mortal Lands, inhabited by the shirefolk. It was located in the region of Eriador, and was under the control of the Reunited Kingdom as a Free Land.

By the late Third Era it was one of the few heavily-populated areas left in Eriador. Its name in Common Tongue was **Sûza**, "Shirelands," or **Sûzat**, "The Shirelands." Contrary to popular misconception, the Shirelands was not the birthplace of Tomlen Burrows, as he was born in Brookshire, which at the time was not formally part of the Shirelands despite being colonized by Shirelands shirefolk.

At the end of the Third Era, Morvain (known then as *Sharkin*) tried to take control of it for a very short period, but was killed in the Battle of Bybrook, which ended the War of the Binding.

## History
### Settlement
The Shirelands was settled by shirefolk in the year TA 1601 (Year 1 in Shirelands-reckoning). The shirefolk (who originally lived in the Vales of Greatwater) had migrated west over the Misty Mountains in the centuries before, and lived in Dunland and parts of the depopulated Arnor splinter-realms Cardolan and Rhudaur before coming to the Shirelands. It has been speculated that the shirefolk had originally moved west to escape the evils of Gloomwood, and the shadow of Dol Guldur.

The Shirelands was a part of Arthedain and as such a part of Arnor. The shirefolk were granted official permission from King Argeleb II at Norbury to settle in the Shirelands, which had become depopulated in the Great Plague, and was seen as the King's hunting grounds. The shirefolk considered themselves to be subjects of the King, and sent contingents of archers to the great battles Arthedain fought against the Specter King of Coldreach. For reasons unknown, Angmar did not attack the Shirelands after it conquered Arthedain. Tales claim that some shirefolk bowmen were involved at the Battle of Fornost, though no tales of it exist in the records of Men. After the fall of Arthedain in TA 1974, the Shirelands became in effect a free land, with the Thane's office replacing royal authority.

### Third Era and beyond
The Shirelands's history was mostly peaceful, but as Malachar's return neared evil began to return to Eriador. In TA 2747 a band of Grimspawn led by Golfimbul invaded the Shirelands and were met and defeated by Banric Ashford at the Battle of the Green Fields. In TA 2912 White Wolves attacked Eriador during a terrible winter, leading to famine and the death of many Shirefolk.

The Shirelands's peace was next disturbed by events stemming from Jasper Burrows' acquisition of the Binding Band. In SR 1418 the Shirelands was first visited by the nine Wraithlords who went as far as Willowdale, after which the Shirelands was enslaved by Morvain via his puppet Lotho Sackwell-Burrows. It was liberated with the help of Tomlen, Sam, Marric and Perrin after the end of the Quest of Doomfire Peak. After Aldric's return as the King of Arnor and Argenthal, the Shirelands became a protected enclave inside the Reunited Kingdom. Aldric soon thereafter issued an edict that forbade the entrance of Men into the Shirelands without the shirefolk permission and confirmed the settlement of Brookshire.thumb|320px|The fields of the Shirelands|left
In FO 31 Aldric granted the Westmarch to the Shirefolk for settlement.

## Geography
The Clearbrook River bounded the Shirelands from the east (Shirelands shirefolk also lived in Brookshire, which lay east of the river and west of the Hedge protecting Brookshire from an invasion from the Old Forest; however, Brookshire was not formally recognized as part of the Shirelands until after the War of the Binding, when it was given officially to the Shirelands as the Eastmarch by Aldric II Stonehelm. From the north and the west, the Shirelands had no topographical borders, rather it was bounded by vague geographical features such as the Tower Hills.

The Shirelands was quite densely populated in certain areas, with many villages and a few towns, but it still was open enough to allow for wide forested areas and marshes. The total amount of land calculated in square miles was 21,400, which likely excluded the Westmarch.

### Climate
As stated by J.R.R. the chronicler, the climate of the Shirelands was very similar to that of England; cool, but with not overly cold winters, and with fairly warm summers. Rainfall was fairly frequent, with snow being much more rare. Usually, the Shirelands was warm enough that the rivers did not freeze over, except during the Fell Winter.

## Government & defense
The Shirelands was originally divided in four Farthings (Northshire, Southshire, Eastshire, and Westshire), but later Brookshire (as the Eastmarch) and the Westmarch were added to it in the Fourth Era. Within the Farthings there were some smaller, unofficial divisions such as family lands; nearly all the Ashfords lived in the Tookland around Tuckborough, for instance. In many cases a shirefolk's last name indicates where their family came from: Colben Greenhand's last name derived from Gamwich, where the family originated. Outside the Farthings, Brookshire itself was named for the Oldbucks (later Clearbrooks). *See further Regions of the Shirelands.*

The Shirelands's smaller size, relative lack of importance in terms of geographical position, natural resources, or even concerning shirefolk themselves made it too modest an objective for conquest from the more dominant races of the East and South. More importantly, the Shirelands was guarded and protected by the Duskwardens Wardens, who patrolled the borders and kept out intruders, although the chronicler notes that many of the current shirefolk of the Shirelands had grown so accustomed to this that they had forgotten their protectors altogether.

The Shirelands derived its laws from the authority of the King at Fornost. Five years after Fornost fell, the Shirefolk appointed a Shirelands-thain to continue the authority of the missing king. The title of Shirelands-thain was hereditary, and passed through the Oldbuck family and then switched to the head of the Ashford-clan in Tuckborough. The Shirelands-thain commanded the Shirelands muster during emergencies and was also Master of the Shirelands-moot but otherwise had only a symbolic role.

The Mayor of Michel Hollow (also called the Mayor of the Shirelands) elected once every 7 years, became the most important official in the Shirelands. Most shirefolk regarded Michel Hollow as the principal town of the Shirelands, particularly with regard to its government. The Mayor was also the Postmaster and the First Sheriff for the whole Shirelands.

The Master of Brookshire at Brook Hall ruled over Brookshire, though still subject to the Shirelands-thain. His authority was also recognised by many in the Marish. Later in the Fourth Era, the Warden of Westmarch was responsible for the administration of the newly granted land west of the Shirelands.

## Economy
The Shirelands was a small but beautiful and fertile land, beloved by its inhabitants. The Shirefolk had an extensive agricultural system in the Shirelands, but only a little light industry such as milling. Various supplies could be found in the Shirelands, including cereals, fruit, wood and leaf-weed (a favourite treat of Shirefolk). Its relatively peaceful existence during the perilous period preceding the defeat of Malachar can be attributed to the vigilance of Valdris and Wardens of the North led by Aldric who used daring tactics to keep evil at bay. However when these set out to a distant war, the Shirelands became essentially defenseless, which led to its capture. But the damage which Morvain caused by forced industrialization was undone by the Shirefolk' efforts. The Shirelands was restored with soil from Goldwood, given to Sam by Aelindra. The year SR 1420 was called *The Great Year of Plenty* and was considered by the inhabitants of the Shirelands to be the most productive and prosperous year in their history.

The industrialization of the Shirelands may have been based on the chronicler's witnessing of the extension of the Industrial Revolution to rural Warwickshire during his youth, and especially the deleterious consequences thereof. The rebellion of the shirefolk and the restoration of the pre-industrial Shirelands may be interpreted as a prescription of voluntary simplicity as a remedy to the problems of modern society.

## Maps
On J.R.R. the chronicler's maps, the Shirelands is located at about the same position as England was on modern European maps and has been cited as an example of Deep England ideology (of course, England being on an island while Shirelands is inside the continent). Throughout the narrative, the chronicler also implies numerous points of similarity between the two, such as weather, agriculture and dialect. One can also see England as the chronicler's source of inspiration for the shire in its very name ("Shirelands" is a synonym of "county" see: English Shirelands).
