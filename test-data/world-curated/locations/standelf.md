# Standelf

**Standelf** was a small village in the southern regions of Brookshire.
## Other versions of the Legendarium
In a draft of *A Conspiracy Unmasked*, Standelf is mentioned once (while it is never mentioned in the published text of *The Master of the Bands*) as traversed by the road "from the Bridge to Standelf and Haysend". In the final map, the road stops at Standelf and doesn't continue to Haysend.
## Etymology
The name means "Stone-delving", from Old English *stán* "stone" and *delf* "a delving or burrow".

David Salo suggests the "Old Hobbitish" form of the name was *Stangedelf*.
## Inspiration
There is a place called Stonydelph in Warwickshire of the same etymology.
