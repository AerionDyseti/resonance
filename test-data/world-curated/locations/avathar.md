# Avathar

**Avathar** was a dark strip of land at the feet of the southern Pelóri mountain range in the continent of The Far West.__NOTOC__

## History
Avathar was a wasteland devoid of all life save for the Great Spider The Webmother whose home was there before she agreed to go with Tenebros to The Mortal Lands. After Tenebros left The Blessed Realm, the The Pantheon, believing that their foe had fled to The Mortal Lands to his old hiding places, did not think him still in The Far West and did not find him here.

## Etymology
***Avathar*** is a High Amtreadan word that meant 'shadows' or 'the Shadows'.

### Earlier names
the chronicler's very first conception of Avathar, predating even the *Lost Tales*, was "**Habannan**", a place mentioned only in an early poem from 1915 entitled "Habannan beneath the Stars". Four name-changes then occurred before the publishing of : *Habannan *was emended to ***Eruman***, which became a name "interchangeable with ***Arvalin***". These names appear throughout the tales contained in . Eruman ultimately was changed to ***Araman****. Araman *and *Arvalin* shared slightly similar definitions: 'close to The Far West' and 'beside The Blessed Realm'. The character The Webmother was invented during the use of the name *Arvalin*, and her realm eventually was exclusively called ***Avathar***.
