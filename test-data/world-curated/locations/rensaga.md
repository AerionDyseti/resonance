# Írensaga

**Írensaga** was a tall mountain with a series of saw-toothed peaks situated within the White Mountains in Aranada.

Alongside the Starkhorn and the Dwimorberg, Írensaga was part of the juncture which formed the great shelf Darkharrow was on in the valley of Harrowdale in Aranada.

## Etymology
- Írensaga* is a name in Old English representing a Aranadan name meaning "iron-saw" in reference to the serrated ridge atop the mountain's summit.

## In other versions
In earlier drafts of , the chronicler wrote ***Irensaga*** without an accent over the "I" and did not include a hyphen in the translation of the name. While it is untold why the chronicler added the accent, it is possible that the first word *Íren* is meant to correspond with *Īren* ("iron") to make for a long "i" sound, rather than a short one with an unaccented *iren*.
