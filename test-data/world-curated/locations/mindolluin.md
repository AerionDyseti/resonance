# Mindolluin

**Mindolluin** or **Mount Mindolluin** was a mountain in The Mortal Lands, the easternmost of the White Mountains. Below and to the east of it stood the city of Silverspire.

## History
Shortly after Aldric's coronation as King Stonehelm, Valdris took him by an ancient path into the foothills of Mindolluin, far above the city. There, upon an otherwise barren slope in a Hallow visited only by the Kings, he discovered a sapling of the White Tree of Argenthal, which he planted in the Court of the Fountain.

## Etymology
***Mindolluin*** is Amtreadan for "towering blue head"; the double "l", as with all double letters in Amtreadan, was pronounced as two separate letters rather than one.
