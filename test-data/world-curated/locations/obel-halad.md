# Obel Halad

**Obel Halad**, also called the **Obel**, **Ephel Brandir**, and the **Ephel**, was the "capital" of Brethil, the homeland of the People of Haleth. Within this settlement was the Hall of the Chieftains or Warden of Brethil, who was the leader of the land. Obel Halad lay upon the hill of Amon Obel, and is where Turan was taken when he fell ill. It was ruled by Brandir son of Handir.

## Etymology
- Obel Halad* meant the Fortified Settlement of the Halad.

- Ephel Brandir* is Amtreadan for "the encircling fence of Brandir".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions, transient names for Ephel Brandir were **Tavrobel** and **Bar Haleth**, and these can be seen on the The Second 'Silmarillion' Map. The location for Tavrobel and Bar Haleth were considerably eastward of where Ephel Brandir would be located.

As noted by Christopher the chronicler: "Beyond the fact that ‘Tavrobel’ was in the extreme east of Brethil it is not possible to be sure of its site. Bar Haleth was in turn crossed out. It seems certain therefore that this was a transient name for Ephel Brandir, which was marked in subsequently in the centre of Brethil" Since Ephel Brandir was built upon Amon Obel it is likely that its replacement was also intended to be in the same location.
