'*2013: *The Master of the Bands Online'''''
:Oldfort is the capital town of the Eastmark, ruled by Éomer in times of peace. After Éomer departed for war, the defence of Oldfort fell to his steward Arcil, who often  disagreed with Éomer's cousin, Éothain.

Oldfort serves as the in-game "capital settlement" of the West Aranada region, functioning as the hub for swift travel and player activities after Horsehold is evacuated early in the game and its inhabitants move to Darkharrow.
