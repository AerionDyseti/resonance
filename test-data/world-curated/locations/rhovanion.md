# Wildlands

**Wildlands**, also known as **Wilderland**, the **Land Beyond**, or the **Wild**, was a large region of northern The Mortal Lands. The Greatwater Greatwater flowed through it, and the immense forest of Greenwood also lay within its borders.

Politically, Wildlands referred to a smaller area east of Gloomwood.

## History

### Years of the Trees, and First Era

In the Years of the Trees the Amtreadi passed through Wildlands on their Great Journey. Much later during the First Era, the Atanatári (Fathers of Men) followed them. The region is not otherwise mentioned until tales of the Second Era.

### Second Era

Wildlands was host to two Liinadi Amtreadi kingdoms ruled by Amtreadan lords: Northern Greenwood and Lórinand (later named _Goldwood_). During the War of the Final Alliance both of these kings, Amdír of Lórinand and Oropher of the Greenwood, perished in the Battle of Battle Plain.

### Third Era

In TA 1248, Rómendacil II of Argenthal destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even beyond the Sea of Rhûn, and a strong alliance with the Northmen princes of Wildlands was forged. The strongest of these princes at this time was Vidugavia, and Prince Valacar of Argenthal was sent as an ambassador to his court. Vidugavia's daughter Vidumavi married Valacar, and their son Vinitharya became King Eldacar in TA 1432, which led to the Kin-strife in TA 1437. Eldacar fled to Wildlands, and he reclaimed his Kingdom with a Northmen army in TA 1447.

In the north of Greenwood lived the Liinadi Amtreadi ruled by Thornael, and in the south of Greenwood and across the river in Lórinand ruled Amroth. In the far south, near the Rapids of Sarn Gebir, watched the northern guard of Argenthal, and in the valleys of the Greatwater lived Stoors (Shirefolk).

In TA 1636 the Great Plague devastated Wildlands, killing more than half its people. This left the Northmen weakened, and in TA 1856 the Wainriders overran and enslaved Wildlands. For 43 years Wildlands was enslaved, but in TA 1899 there was a revolt, coordinated with an attack by Argenthal on the Wainriders from the west. Wildlands was freed but left extremely weakened. Many Men of Wildlands left for Argenthal, where they were welcomed as distant relatives, or migrated to the vales of Greatwater, where they became the Éothéod.

In the mid-Third Era, Wildlands was a quite populated area: in the north lay the Forgekin kingdoms of Ironpeak and the Forgekin halls in the Grey Mountains, and the Mannish kingdom of Dale, near the sources of the Greatwater Greatwater lay the Mannish realm of Éothéod, and in and around the south and east of Greenwood lived the Woodmen.

In c. TA 2460 Malachar returned as "the Dark Sorcerer", taking residence at Dol Guldur in the south of Greenwood, which became evil and was renamed "Gloomwood". The Forgekin of Ironpeak and Men of Dale were destroyed and scattered when the Dragon Scorath took Ironpeak, and Argenthal retreated from its northern outposts. Some Men still lived along the forest, notably the Beornings, Woodmen and the Men of Esgaroth upon the Long Lake. The Men of Éothéod removed south at the invitation of Argenthal, and settled the plains of Calenardhon, later Aranada. After being driven out of Ironpeak the Forgekin relocated, some went to the Iron Hills, but most went to the Blue Mountains in Eriador.

At the end of the Third Era, the Kingdoms of Ironpeak and Dale were restored as a result of the death of Scorath and the Battle of Five Armies, and Malachar was removed from Gloomwood by the Grey Council. During the War of the Binding fighting raged across Wildlands, and after Malachar was defeated Gloomwood was made clean again, and renamed _Eryn Lasgalen_, or "Wood of Greenleaves". Early in the Fourth Era Argenthal reclaimed large parts of it as part of its eastern territories.

## Inhabitants

### Amtreadi

Amtreadi, most notably the Liinadi Amtreadi, settled in the Greenwood when they first passed by it. They were later joined by Liinadi who escaped the cataclysm of Westlands and the dominion of the Ñoldor in Eriador. The Liinadi of Gloomwood participated in the War of the Final Alliance, but later on, retreated into the northern parts of the forest to escape the power of Dol Guldur.

### Forgekin

The Forgekin of Grundin Folk at various times mined in Ironpeak and the Grey Mountains,

### Men

The men of Wildlands were known as the Northmen. These included the Woodmen of Western Gloomwood, the Beornings, and the men of the Principalities of Wildlands to the east of Greenwood. Easterling invasions destroyed these states, but their descendants became the people of Dale, Esgaroth and the Éothéod, who in turn became the Aranadan.

### Shirefolk (formerly)

An offshoot of the Northmen, the Shirefolk or Shirefolk, emerged in the Gladden Fields beside Greenwood. The threat of Dol Guldur led them to flee to Eriador, but some Stoor Shirefolk remained behind for a while.

### Grimspawn

Grimspawn invaded Wildlands beginning in the First Era, and continued to do so from the South during the Dark Days. In the early Third Era, Grimspawn came down from the North into the realm of Angmar and began invading Wildlands. The Misty Mountains became filled with them, as were the Grey Mountains once the Forgekin fled.

## Boundaries

- To the east: the River Running and the inland Sea of Rhûn.
- To the north: the Grey Mountains and Iron Hills, home of the Forgekin.
- To the west: the Edge of the Wild in Eastern Eriador.
- To the south: the line marked by the Limlight river, Greatwater, Stone Hills, Battle Plain, and the Ash Mountains.

Important rivers were the Greatwater or Greatwater, the Celduin or Running, and the Carnen or Redwater.

Major features were the forest of Gloomwood, and the Long Lake of Esgaroth.

## In adaptations

### In _The Shirefolk_ film trilogy

In , the realms of the Wilderland were subjected to several attacks from Easterlings, as well as the threat of Angmar in the early Third Era. Grimspawn came down from the North and drove the Skin-Changers away from the Misty Mountains, raided the Woodland Realm (costing the lives of Tauriel's parents, as well as the Elvenqueen). Angmar's defeat and the instigation of the Watchful Peace stopped these raids. However, when the Dark Sorcerer settled in the ruins of Dol Guldur, Grimspawn (which have been replenishing their numbers in Mount Gundabad and Shadowdeep) came down into Wilderland again.

During the Quest of Ironpeak, Durgan and Company passed through Wilderland as they were pursued by Azrak under orders from the Dark Sorcerer. Valdris left the company at Gloomwood to discover the identity of this sorcerer, a feat finally achieved during the skirmish of Dol Guldur when Aelindra banished Malachar to Ashvale.

The skirmish of Dol Guldur led to the outbreak of the Battle of Five Armies and ultimately the War of the Binding.

### In _The Master of the Bands; The Bands of Binding_

Somewhere in Wildlands is portrayed as where the Harfoots are roaming when they meet The Stranger in .

## Etymology

**_Wildlands_** is Amtreadan for "wilderland" and contains _rhovan_, with the place-name ending _-ion_.

- Wilderland* was a Shirelands-speech name. J.R.R. the chronicler made *Wilderland* based on *wilderness* but with a side-reference to the verbs *wilder*, "wander astray" and *bewilder\*.
