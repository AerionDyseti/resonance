# Westmark

The **Westmark** was a region of Aranada that was east of the Gap of Aranada and contained Thornwall Keep. Its border with the Eastmark was marked by the Snowbourn River.

## History

Erikbrand, Lord of the Westmark, rode with Valdris to Thornwall Keep to relieve Theron's battered army.

In the War of the Binding, the Westmark was attacked by Morvain's Grimspawn of Ironspire and men of Dunland, and several villages were burned down. Most of the people however had been sent to shelter in the Thornwall by Erikbrand.
