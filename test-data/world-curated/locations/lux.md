Location Description: Lux, the capital of the Solaaran Empire, is a meticulously planned city embodying the ideals of order and hierarchy, with a population of 60,000-75,000. Its architecture features a blend of Ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman styles, with a layout centered around the Great Plaza of Ascension and divided into caste-specific districts. Governed by a theocratic system, the Empress rules from the Spire of Sol, while cultural life is heavily regulated to glorify the Empire. The economy operates under imperial decree, and the Sunken District serves as a chaotic area for non-citizens and dissidents, contrasting with the city's structured environment.

### **Overview**

The capital of Solaarus is a marvel of magical and mundane engineering, a planned city designed to be a testament to the Empire's ideals. Known as the Jewel of the Desert, Lux stands as the undisputed center of Solaaran power and culture.

Positioned strategically within the heart of Solaaran territory, Lux serves as both the administrative center and spiritual heart of the Empire. Its carefully designed layout reflects the rigid caste structure that defines Solaaran society, creating a living embodiment of the Empire's philosophy of order and hierarchy. Every aspect of Lux was meticulously planned to reinforce the Empire's ideals of divine order and ascension.

- **Population & Size:** Home to approximately 60,000-75,000 people, the walled city is a dense and compact 4-5 square miles.

### **Architecture and Layout**

- **Architecture:** Built from sun-bleached sandstone and limestone, the style is a clean, geometric fusion of monumental Ancient Egyptian and Greco-Roman architecture. The city is built for the desert, with thick walls, narrow streets for shade, and subterranean levels for cooling and storage.

Lux presents a unified aesthetic vision. Buildings grow progressively taller and more ornate as they approach the city center, creating a visual hierarchy that mirrors the social structure of the Empire.

- **Layout:**
    1. **The Core:** At the absolute center is the **Great Plaza of Ascension**, containing the **Spire of Sol** (the Empress's residence) and the **High Cathedral.** Surrounding the core is the **Steward Caste District**, a ring of administrative buildings and the primary distribution hubs, ensuring equal access for all.
    2. **The Caste Districts:** The rest of the city is divided into eight sectors radiating outwards, each a dedicated district for one of the remaining Castes.
    3. **The Cultivators District:** Home to the agricultural caste, this district contains the city's greatest gardens, experimental growing facilities, and food distribution centers.

### **Government**

Lux operates under the rigid theocratic rule of the Solaaran Empire. The Empress, believed to be the living embodiment of Sol, rules from the Spire at the city's center. Her will is enacted through a hierarchical bureaucracy of the Steward Caste, who manage the day-to-day operations of the city and Empire.

### **Culture**

Life in Lux revolves around devotion to Sol and service to one's caste. The city's calendar is marked by elaborate religious ceremonies and celebrations of the Empire's achievements. Art and culture are heavily regulated, with emphasis on works that glorify the Empire and its divine purpose. Despite this control, Lux boasts impressive academies, libraries, and theaters—provided their output aligns with imperial values.

### **Commerce**

The economy of Lux is as carefully planned as its streets. Markets are organized by caste, with resources allocated according to imperial decree rather than market forces. Trade with outsiders is strictly regulated, occurring primarily through designated foreign merchants who must adhere to complex protocols.

### **The Sunken District**

Not all who live in Lux are part of the Caste system. The **Sunken District** (formally the Foreign Quarter) is a small, chaotic sector for "residents" who are not full citizens. It is home to:

- **Foreign Nationals:** Diplomats, contract workers, and refugees.
- **The Un-Casted:** Solaaran citizens who were judged unworthy of joining any of the castes.
- **Dissidents:** Those who have actively rejected the Caste system.

The Sunken District is the only place in Lux where a **black market**, operating on barter and favors, can thrive. It stands in stark contrast to the ordered districts of the city proper, featuring narrow, winding streets and buildings that don't conform to the imperial aesthetic. Recent reports indicate growing unrest in this district, with rumors of organized resistance against imperial authority.

### **Notable Features**

- **The High Cathedral of Sol:** The spiritual center of the Empire, this massive temple complex houses the most powerful clerics and the most sacred relics of the solar faith.
- **The Spire of Sol:** The tallest structure in the city, this gleaming tower serves as the Empress's residence and the seat of imperial power.
- **The Great Library:** A vast repository of knowledge maintained by the Scholar Caste, containing texts from throughout the Empire's history.
- **The Arena of Light:** A grand colosseum where the Warrior Caste demonstrates their prowess and where major ceremonies are conducted.
- **The Gardens of Reflection:** Elaborate water gardens in the Cultivators District that serve both practical and aesthetic purposes.
