# Hoarwell

The **Hoarwell**, also known as **Mitheithel**, was a great river of Eriador.

## Geography
The Hoarwell began in the northern reaches of the Misty Mountains and then flowed through the Ettenmoors, after which it bent south. The Great East Road crossed it at the Last Bridge, after which it was eventually met by the Loudwater, forming the **Angle** where the Duskwardens dwelt after the fall of Arnor.

From there the Hoarwell formed the northern border of Eregion, until it was met by the Glanduin at Swanfleet and became the Gwathló.

## Etymology
The name **Mitheithel** means "Gray Well" in Amtreadan.
