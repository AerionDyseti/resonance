# Stoor-country

The **Stoor-country** refers to the regions where the Stoors originally settled. They first lived in the Vales of Greatwater, near the Gladden Fields. Later, some of them migrated westward into Eriador and settled in the area that would become the Shirelands, particularly in the Marish region of the Eastshire.

Later still, some Stoors moved back to the Stoor-country. These Stoors made boats of reeds and were the ancestors of Slivven and Daglen, who both lived in the Stoor-country.
