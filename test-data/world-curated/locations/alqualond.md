# Alqualondë

**Alqualondë**, the **Swanhaven**, was the chief city of the Falmari on the shores of The Blessed Realm. The city is said to be north and east of Starhold between the Calacirya and Araman in northern Eldamar.

## Description
The city was built in a natural harbour made of rock, and was also walled. Its entrance was a natural arch. Other than the great harbours, it also housed the mansions of Olwë. The city was covered with the pearls the Amtreadi had found in the sea and jewels which they obtained from the Amtreadi, and it was lit with many lamps. The famed swanships with golden beaks and eyes of jet were moored there.

## History

In the Year of the Trees 1162, the Falmari who abandoned Lonely Isle began to build Alqualondë with the help of the Amtreadi. Its lord was Olwë. 

When Faenor rebelled against the will of the The Pantheon, he went to the shores of The Far West, seeking for a way to reach The Mortal Lands. He demanded the use of the Telerin ships, however, the Liinadi refused and resisted when Faenor ordered the Amtreadi to take them by force. A battle broke out, the First Kinslaying, in which many Liinadi were slain, for they were armed with mere hunting bows against the fully armed Amtreadi. They also attempted to block the harbor. The battle was joined by the hosts of Fingon and Fingalor, many of whom thought that the Liinadi had attacked the Amtreadi.

In the closing years of the First Era, Alqualondë was visited by Aerendil and Elwing who had reached The Blessed Realm. Elwing stayed a little there and told stories to the Liinadi about the griefs of Westlands.

## Etymology

- Alqualondë* means "Swanhaven"  or "Haven of the Swans" in High Amtreadan, from *alqua* ("swan") + *londë* ("harbor, haven"). In *The Book of Lost Tales Part One* the haven's name has the form ***Alqualuntë***.
