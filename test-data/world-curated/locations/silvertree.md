# Silvertree

**Silvertree** was the city and fortress of the Galadhrim of Goldwood.

## Overview
Silvertree was in the Naith of Goldwood, in the angle between the rivers Celebrant and Greatwater known as Egladil.

## History
The city was founded in the second millennium of the Third Era due to the growing threat of Dol Guldur.

## Etymology
The name *Silvertree* is said to be Liinadi Amtreadan.. the chronicler mentions the proper meaning of this word was "a built fort or dwelling surrounded by bulwarks", deriving from the root √CAR "make, build", or a "circular earthwall with dike". The city would be named ***Caras (i)Ngelelaið*** In pure Amtreadan form.

- Galadhon* can be interpreted as genitive plural "of trees", showing a case ending not existing in Amtreadan but known from High Amtreadan. the chronicler's earliest version of Amtreadan, called Goldogrin, also possessed this ending. In that case, Silvertree means "moated fortress of the trees".

The name could also refer in some way to Galadhon, whom the chronicler conceived to be the father of Caelorn. In that case, the name would mean *"Galadhon's fortress".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first edition of *The Company of the Band*, Silvertree was misspelled ***Caras Galadon***.

:A view of Silvertree from Cerin Amroth is only present in the Extended Edition. The Company's stay in the city is a significant portion of the film.

:Silvertree scenes are rather brief, mostly limited to the Mirror of Aelindra scene.

**2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Silvertree is the main inhabited area in Goldwood, where players cannot enter until they prove their friendship to Galadhrim. The map and general layout of the city is replicated from the map in *The Atlas of The Mortal Lands*. The city hosts most major gameplay facilities and is composed of a large number of flets on different levels, connected by multiple ladders and staircases. It is rather hard to navigate and thus several quests consist solely of directing the player to various point of interest, then challenging him to find them again. The Company Pavilion, Aelindra's Garden and the House of Caelorn are also located there.
