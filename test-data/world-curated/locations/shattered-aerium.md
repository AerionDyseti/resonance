Part Of: Elemental Plane of Air (Elemental%20Plane%20of%20Air%201f9ca0aafe2181a9b09cfe16b69e4f80.md)
Location Description: The Shattered Aerium is a ruined palace in the Plane of Air, marked by magical instability and fractured crystalline architecture. Its once-elegant design features spires of crystal and marble that hover at odd angles, creating a constantly shifting environment. Visitors experience echoes of its former glory alongside dangerous magical energy and reality distortions, making it perilous for the unprepared.

## Overview

The Shattered Aerium stands as a haunting testament to the catastrophic planar breach that occurred in Azrai. Once a majestic palace in the Plane of Air, this ethereal structure now exists in a perpetual state of magical instability, its crystalline architecture fractured and suspended in an impossible configuration.

## Architecture and Appearance

The palace's original elegant design is still visible in its remaining fragments - soaring spires of translucent crystal and clouded marble now hover at odd angles, held aloft by conflicting gravitational forces. Sections of the palace drift apart and reconnect in an ever-shifting dance, creating new pathways and deadends with each passing hour.

## Magical Properties

Reality itself has become unstable within the Sanctum's bounds. Visitors report seeing echoes of the palace's former glory overlapping with its current ruined state. The air crackles with volatile magical energy, manifesting in unpredictable bursts of elemental power.

<aside>
Warning: The unstable magical conditions within the Shattered Sanctum make it extremely dangerous for unprepared visitors. Reality distortions and spontaneous elemental manifestations are common occurrences.
