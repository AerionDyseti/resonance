# Dimbar

## History

Dimbar was still empty and seemingly at peace even after the ravages of the Battle of Sudden Flame, possibly due to the watchfulness of the Men of Brethil. Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Huor and Huran, both very young at the time, became lost in this land after a fight with Grimspawn, but were both rescued by Thorondor and his Skywardens and taken to Hidden City. But after the losses of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Dimbar became infested with Grimspawn, leading the Men of Brethil and the Liinadi Amtreadi of Greyvale under their valiant captains Turan and Beleg Cúthalion to mount many daring raids against them.

When Turan exiled himself from Greyvale, Dimbar was overrun by Grimspawn coming from Taur-nu-Fuin threatening Brethil and Beleg went in search of Turan to urge him to return to help rid the land of Grimspawn. Turan refused choosing to remain an outlaw. During their journey to Hidden City, Tuor and the Amtreadi Voronwë camped near Dimbar in a shallow cave on a hillside that overlooked it.

Dimbar was cold and desolate when Huran came there not long after being released from Iron Fortress, seeking Hidden City.
