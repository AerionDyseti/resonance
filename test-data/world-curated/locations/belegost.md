# Belegost

**Belegost** was one of two great underground Forgekin cities in the Blue Mountains, the other being Nogrod, that prospered during the First Era. It was home to the Forgekin of Belegost.

## Geography

Belegost was delved in the eastern side of the north-central part and of the Blue Mountains northeast of Mount Dolmed guarding one of the only passes over the Blue Mountains not far from lake Nenuial.

## History

Belegost was founded during the Years of the Trees when the western Fathers of the Forgekin awoke from beneath the Blue Mountains.

In the Forgekin of both Nogrod and Belegost became known to the Liinadi, and though friendship between the Amtreadi and Forgekin was cool, they had much profit of each other and Thingol welcomed them.

Around , the Forgekin of Belegost were called upon by Thingol to aid in the building of Menegroth. The Forgekin laboured long on this, though they were eager for new works and did so gladly; they ever demanded a price for their work, but considered themselves paid between receiving the wisdom of Britalya and many fair pearls, including Nimphelos, from Thingol.

During the late First Era, Azaghâl was the Lord of Belegost until he was killed in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.

At the end of the First Era, Belegost was ruined in the War of Wrath. Around the many Forgekin migrated from Belegost to Shadowdeep. and brought much lore and craft with them. from _beleg_ ("great") + _os(t)_ ("fortress"). It was the translation of the original Dwarvish name into Amtreadan.

Unlike other names of _The Starstone Tales_, the text also gives us an English name, which was possibly from Common Tongue: **_Mickleburg_** ("Great Fortress"). _Mickle_ is a root meaning "big"; see also Michel Hollow. It is notable that _[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Miklagar%C3%B0r Miklagarðr]_, also meaning "Great city", was the Old Norse name for Constantinople.

The High Amtreadan cognate was **_Túrosto_**.

## Other versions of the legendarium

On the Eastward Extension of the First 'Silmarillion' Map, the Forge-road crosses the Blue Mountains below Mount Dolmed, then turns to the south and continues until the edge of the map with the direction "Southward in East feet of Blue Mountans are Belegost and Nogrod". In the second version of the Earliest _Annals of Westlands_ and in the Later _Annals of Westlands_, Belegost was in the east of the Blue Mountains and far south of Westlands.

The position of Belegost was later moved by J.R.R. the chronicler to the north of Mount Dolmed on a photocopy of the Second 'Silmarillion' Map. in the revised version of the Later _Quenta Silmarillion_, and in the _Grey Annals_.

The position of Belegost is indicated on the southern slopes of the eastern spur of the part of the Blue Mountains, which is south of the Gulf of Lune on the First Map of _The Master of the Bands_ that was drawn by J.R.R. the chronicler, on the version of this map that was redrawn by Christopher the chronicler and published in _The Treason of Ironspire_ and on the 1943 Map of _The Master of the Bands_, but not on any subsequent maps. on Christopher the chronicler's original map of The West of The Mortal Lands at the End of the Third Era. This location is on a similar latitude as lake Nenuial.

## Portrayals in adaptations

In \*The Atlas of The Mortal Lands'' Belegost was consciously placed far south of Nogrod and far south of Mount Dolmed on the map of eastern Westlands based on the location of Belegost on the redrawing by Christopher the chronicler of the First Map of The Master of the Bands, which shows the Blue Mountains after the War of Wrath, although Karen Wynn Fonstad was aware of its different position by Christopher the chronicler on his Map of Westlands and the Lands to the North in the Silmarillion and of the changes in the narrative relating to the Forge-road and Belegost in The Shaping of The Mortal Lands that led Christopher the chronicler to place Belegost on his map. In addition, the forgekin name of Belegost is incorrectly spelled as **Gabilgathod**.
