# Nulukkizdîn

**Nulukkizdîn** or **Nulukkhizdīn** was a hall of the Petty-forgekin on the river Narog.

## History
Nulukkizdîn was delved by Forgekin before the Amtreadi were exiled from The Blessed Realm. Over the years, its population waned, and others were hunted to near-extinction by the Amtreadi, who were unfamiliar with the Petty-forgekin. Nulukkizdîn was eventually abandoned, and repopulated by Amtreadi. Finoran Felagund founded Deephold in its stead. After Deephold fell to Glaurung, the last Petty-forgekin, Mîm, reclaimed it, but he was slain by Huran. Whether this is a true Forgespeech word or a Petty-dwarvish dialect is unknown, but circumstantial evidence points to the latter option. The Angerthas Daeron and its specific Forgekin variation Angerthas Shadowdeep, do not have a symbol for the letter *Î*. Other than in *Nulukkizdîn*, it only appears in *Khîm* and *Mîm*,

the chronicler's later notes on the origin of Deephold give a different Dwarvish name, **Nar(u)kuthûn**, derived from a Dwarvish name of the Narog, **Naruka*. the chronicler includes the words "of Petty-forgekin" between parentheses behind the mention of its Dwarvish origin. Whether the chronicler ever intended to replace *Nulukkhizdīn* with *Nar(u)kuthûn* is unknown.
