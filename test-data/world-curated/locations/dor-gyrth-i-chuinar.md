# Dor Gyrth i chuinar

**Dor Gyrth i chuinar** was a land in southern Ossiriand so named by the Amtreadi, where Beren and Luthiel dwelt after their return to life.

It was located around the river Adurant east of the Gelion, and was known for surrounding Tol Galen, where Beren and Luthiel lived again after being released from the Halls of Neth until their final deaths.

## History

Being a part of Ossiriand, this country was originally inhabited by the Nandor Amtreadi and their later related brethren, the Laegeldrim, after the death of their lord Thornhelm in the First Battle of Westlands. The extent of the Amtreadi population was probably sparse and hidden at this time.

Some time around FA 469, having been granted a second but mortal life by Luth under The Primordial, Beren and Luthiel returned to The Mortal Lands from the Halls of Neth and settled on the isle of Tol Galen in southern Ossiriand. Thence the Eldar began to call the area _Dor Gyrth i chuinar_. News of their return spread amongst the Laiquendi, and the couple were regarded in high honour. Dior, the son of Beren and Luthiel was born in this country. After Beren recovered the Nauglamír and the Starstone within it after the Battle of Sarn Athrad, it was said and sung that Luthiel wore it around her neck, and was therefore held as a great beauty in The Mortal Lands. Afterwards, the land became fair and beautiful, with a light and beauty like that seen only in The Blessed Realm, and apparently remained so until the final deaths of Beren and Luthiel and its destruction after the War of Wrath.

## Etymology

- Dor Gyrth i chuinar* was a name in Amtreadan that translated to "Land of the Ghosts that Live". plural form of *cuina\* ("to be alive").

## In other versions

The earliest forms of the name were **I·Guilwarthon** ("Living-dead") and **I·Cuilwarthon** ("Dead That Live Again") in Gnomish. Soon afterwards, the chronicler made a new variant: **Cuilwarthien** ("Land of the Ghosts that Live"). Some time later, he changed the name to **Gwerth-i-cuina** ("Living Dead" or "Land of the Ghosts that Live"). A variation of this was **Gwerth-i-guinar** ("Dead that Live").

In the published version of _The Starstone Tales_, _Dor Gyrth i chuinar_ appears written as **_Dor Firn-i-Guinar_**, a name included also in The Etymologies in _The Lost Road and Other Writings_.

the chronicler changed the name finally to _Dor Gyrth i chuinar_ in 1972, in a reference to the death of his wife, Edith the chronicler.
