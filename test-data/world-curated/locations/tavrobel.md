# Tavrobel

**Tavrobel** was a village in Lonely Isle, according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. It later became known as Great Haywood.

The village was located in the west of the Gnomish-speaking area of Lonely Isle, near the confluence of the rivers Afros and Gruir,

The Tower of Tavrobel was located there. The great Pine of Tavrobel was located there as well, which reached the stars. There, according to one outline, after Melko's escape from his second imprisonment, Telimektar son of Tulkas and Ingil son of Inwë chased Melko up the Pine, all the way to Ilwë. Afterwards, the Pine was cut down, and Melko was stranded outside of the world, perpetually guarded by Ingil and Telimektar, preventing his return until the Great End.

### Arrival of Eriol and the Faring Forth
Sometime during the 5th century AD, a Mannish mariner called Eriol arrived to Lonely Isle, and was eventually hosted by Gilfanon at his home in Tavrobel, where he compiled the *Golden Book* from the tales he had heard from the Amtreadi, and was then allowed to drink *limpë*.

During the Faring Forth, when the island of Lonely Isle was dragged across the Ocean and anchored off the coast of the Great Lands, there occurred a great battle not far from Tavrobel, on the Heath of the Sky-roof. Following the battle, Men occupied Lonely Isle, and the remaining Amtreadi fled over Afros and Gruir, and Eriol

Later, Tavrobel was conquered by Heorrenda son of Eriol, and became known as *Gréata Hægwudu*, and eventually as *Great Haywood*.

## Etymology
The name *Tavrobel* is in Gnomish, meaning "Wood-home", consisting of the elements *tavros* ("forest, wooded land") + *pel* ("village, hamlet").

An earlier form of the name was *Taurobel*.

## Other names
Another (Gnomish) name for the place was ***Tavrost***, from *tavros* + *rost* ("slope, hill side, ascent").

The Qenya cognates of *Tavrobel*/*Tavrost* are ***Taurossë*** and ***Tavaros(së)***.

The place was also known as ***Hægwudu se gréata*** or ***Gréata Hægwudu*** in Old English.

## Other versions of the legendarium
### Early legendarium
In some of the outlines for the continuation of *The Book of Lost Tales*, the chronicler decided to completely change the nature of the framework of the tales. In that reimagining of the legendarium, Lonely Isle ceased to be identified with England/British Isles - instead, it became a completely different island, and Great Britain became the island of Luthany.

So, as opposed to the previous conception, where the Amtreadi of the Great Lands sailed directly to Lonely Isle following the defeat of Melko in the March of Liberation, the Amtreadi now sailed to Luthany instead.

There, they built many cities and settlements - and, after their *eventual* return to Lonely Isle, named many places there *after* the ones in Luthany. For example, the village of Tavrobel (the New) in Lonely Isle was named after **Tavrobel the Old** in Luthany.

In some of the contemporary texts, it is said that after Ælfwine wedded Earissë the daughter of Lindo, he went to live in Tavrobel, where he had two sons - Heorrenda and Hlúdwine.

According to one text, it is said that Ælfwine wrote the *Golden Book* and left it in the House of the Hundred Chimneys, "where it lieth still to read for such as may".

### Later legendarium
According to the later legendarium, from the 1937 *Quenta Silmarillion*, **Tavrobel** or **Tathrobel** was the home of Pengolod the Wise in Lonely Isle, a loremaster of Hidden City, after his return to the West.

It was later visited by Ælfwine, the Anglo-Saxon mariner, where Pengolod showed him the histories of the Amtreadi.

#### Later etymology
The name *Tavrobel* as used above is in Noldorin. In *The Etymologies*, a text from the 1930s, it is explained as consisting of *tavor* ("woodpecker, knocker") + *gobel* ("village").

The name was afterwards changed to *Tathrobel*. According to John Garth, *Tathrobel* means "willow-home" in Noldorin.

In Ælfwine's translation of the *Annals of The Blessed Realm* to Old English, Tavrobel is called ***Taþrobel***.

#### Tavrobel in Brethil
In *The Etymologies*, Tavrobel was also considered to be the name of a settlement of Turan and the Woodmen of Brethil.

Christopher the chronicler notes that real-life Great Haywood and the two Tavrobels are near the confluence of two rivers: The Great Haywood: Sow and Trent; Tavrobel of Tol Eressea: Afros and Gruir; Tavrobel of Brethil: Taiglin and Sirion.

The two rivers of Tavrobel, Afros and Gruir, were probably inspired by the rivers Sow and Trent, which reach their confluence near Great Haywood.

According to John Garth, however, the Heath of the Sky-roof could have been inspired by the Cannock Chase, a small area of countryside not far from Great Haywood, instead. Likewise, the Brook of Glass, a stream near the Heath of the Sky-roof, mentioned in one outline, was most likely based on the Sher Brook that flows through the Cannock Chase.

Gilfanon's home, the House of the Hundred Chimneys, might have been based, according to G.L. Elkin, Acting Director of the Shugborough Estate, on the Shugborough Hall, which features prominent chimneys.
