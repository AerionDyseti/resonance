# Desolation of the Dragon

The **Desolation of the Dragon** (or the **Desolation of Scorath**) was the wasteland around the Ironpeak and Dale, charred and blackened by the burning breath of Scorath the Dragon. The borders of the Desolation harboured a little clinging greenery and life, but its heart was scorched and utterly barren. The desolate lands extended southwards some miles along the banks of the River Running from Scorath's lair beneath the Ironpeak, but the lands to the north of the mountain seem to have suffered even more fiercely. After Scorath's death, it seems that the Desolation was slowly reclaimed, so that both Ironpeak and Dale were eventually to recover from their destruction and prosper once again.
