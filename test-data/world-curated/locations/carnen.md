# Carnen

The **Carnen**, also known as the **Redwater**, was a river in the region of Rhovanion in The Mortal Lands.

The Carnen originated in the Iron Hills and was east of the Ironpeak. It flowed southward before emptying into the River Running, which was about 250 Oldbloods miles to the south. This river, in turn, flowed  past the land of Dorwinion and into the Sea of Rhûn.

In the War of the Binding, in the year TA 3019, a large force of Easterlings under Malachar's command crossed and forded this river on their way to attack the Forgekin realm of the Ironpeak and the Mannish kingdom of Dale.

## Etymology
- Carnen* is a Amtreadan name meaning "Redwater", consisting of the words *caran* ("red") and *nen* ("water; lake, pool; lesser river").

It is possible that Redwater is a translation of the name for the river in the common tongue.

## In adaptations

In , the origins of river Carnen can be found in the Ironfold region. It begins as six streams flowing into the Iron Hills from the nearby mountains, all shallow and rust-brown in colour. Across the Iron Hills, the streams eventually join into a single river, which then plummets down through several waterfalls into the area called "the Barding-lands", clearing it of sediment before it flows further to the south.
