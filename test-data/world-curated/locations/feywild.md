It contrasts with the structured Material Plane of Enym, showcasing unpredictable emotions and ever-shifting landscapes.

The Feywild is one of the two major worlds within **Soelle** (The First World), representing the chaotic, vibrant aspects of the First Draft of creation. This plane embodies pure, untamed life and serves as the realm of the fey.

## Nature of the Feywild

As part of the First World created by the **Pantheon of Creation**, the Feywild is a plane of:

- **Pure, chaotic life** - untamed and wild
- **Fey magic** - unpredictable and emotion-driven
- **Vibrant landscapes** - ever-shifting and dreamlike
- **Primordial creation** - the original blueprint before Enym's more structured design

## Relationship to Enym

The Feywild serves as a counterpoint to the Material Plane of Enym:

- Where Enym has structure and order, the Feywild has chaos and freedom
- Where Enym follows predictable natural laws, the Feywild operates on emotion and whim
- The instability witnessed in the Feywild led the **Pantheon of Order** to collaborate with Dragons in creating the more structured Enym

## Inhabitants

The Feywild is home to various fey creatures, including the **Eladrin** who served as the blueprint for the Amtreadi created by Anastrasael, the Starfather.
