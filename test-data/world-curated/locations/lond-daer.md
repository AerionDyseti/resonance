# Lond Daer

**Lond Daer Enedh** (also spelt **Ened**) was a great harbour in Eriador founded by the Oldbloods.

## History
Originally, the harbour, under the name ***Vinyalondë***, or "New Haven", was founded by Oldshore's crown prince Aldarion on the estuary of the river Gwathló, between  and .

The Oldbloods hunger for ever more wealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south, Pelargir and Umbar. Following this, the haven was one of several major ports in The Mortal Lands, and was known as Lond Daer Enedh, or "Great Middle Haven", between the Mistport and Pelargir. Despite this, Oldshore still maintained traffic on the Gwathló as far as the city of Tharbad, and Lond Daer was expanded and fortified.

After the Downfall of Oldshore, Aldorion founded the realm of Arnor in the lands north of Lond Daer which was still part of the most safe and efficient route between the Realms in Exile by sea, in connection with Tharbad and the Great Road; but as Lond Daer fell into ruin, Tharbad succeeded it in importance. clearly composed of *lond* ("haven"), *daer* ("great, large") and *enedh* ("middle").
