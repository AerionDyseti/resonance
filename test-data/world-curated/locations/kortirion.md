# Kortirion

**Kortirion** was the chief city of Lonely Isle, according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. at the heart of the island, in the realm of Alalminórë, the Land of Elms.

### Arrival of Eriol
Located in the city was the Cottage of Lost Play, where Eriol, the Mannish mariner who found Lonely Isle, stayed for a while. Rúmil, the old door-ward of the Cottage, and Littleheart, son of Voronwë.

After a while, he also went to the home of Meril-i-Turinqi, the Lady of Lonely Isle, who lived at the foot of the tower of Ingil (her grandfather), amidst a *korin* of elms. There, she told him the story of *the Chaining of Melko*, and *the Coming of the Amtreadi and the Making of Kôr*.

Before winter came to Kortirion that year, Eriol also visited many of the homes of the Liinadi and the Inwir (the royal clan of the Liinadi), who lived there, and learned more of the language, history and customs of the Amtreadi.

### The Faring Forth
Sometime during the 5th century AD, when the disastrous Faring Forth took place, and the island of Lonely Isle was dragged across the Ocean and anchored off the coast of the Great Lands, Men invaded the island, along with Grimspawn, Stonelurks and other evil beings. In the ensuing destruction, Kortirion was one of the places that were ravaged by Men from the Great Lands, with the Amtreadi of Kortirion fleeing from them, and eventually fading away.

However, not all Men were hostile to the Amtreadi, and these were led by Heorrenda, Hengest and Horsa, the sons of Eriol. Kortirion itself was later conquered by Hengest, and became known as *Warwíc* (in the language of his people).

In the etymology of the chronicler's earliest languages, the name of the hill of Kôr refers to its roundness. It is derived from the primitive Amtreadan name *Guord*, from which came Qenya *Qora*, and Gnomish *Gwar*.

## Other names
The Gnomish cognates of *Kortirion* are, depending on the text, either ***Corthirion*** or ***Mindon Gwar*** (with ***Gwarmindon*** being the hypothetical true cognate of *Kortirion*). Both Qenya and Gnomish names mean "Tower of Kôr". It was also called the ***Citadel of the Island*** or the ***Citadel of the World***, by "those that speak of it with love". Its Gnomish cognate is ***Corangos*** (changed from an earlier form *Cormath*).

It was also called ***New Kôr***.

In Old English, the city was called ***Warwíc***.

So, as opposed to the previous conception, where the Amtreadi of the Great Lands sailed directly to Lonely Isle following the defeat of Melko in the March of Liberation, the Amtreadi now sailed to Luthany instead.

There, they built many cities and settlements - and, after their *eventual* return to Lonely Isle, named many places there *after* the ones in Luthany. For example, the city of Kortirion (the New) in Lonely Isle was named after **Kortirion the Old** (i.e. Warwick) in Luthany.

In one note, the capital city of Lonely Isle where Ælfwine was brought to is called **Rôs**. However, other notes continue to have Ælfwine come to Kortirion (the New) instead.

#### *Ælfwine of England*
In the text called *Ælfwine of England* (c. 1920) from *The Book of Lost Tales*, Kortirion (the Old) appears as a city in Luthany (here called ***Luthiel***).

It was ruled by the Prince of Gwar named Óswine, who was friendly to the Amtreadi that still lived on the island. In that city also dwelt the minstrel Déor, along with his wife Éadgifu of Lionesse and their son Ælfwine.

While Ælfwine was still a boy, a fierce people called the Forodwaith (i.e. Vikings) laid siege to the city, during which Óswine, the Prince of Gwar died, as well as Déor and Éadgifu, Ælfwine's parents.

### Later legendarium
In the later version of the legendarium from the 1930, in the preamble to *Quenta Noldorinwa*, **Kortirion** was mentioned as a city in Lonely Isle where Eriol saw and read the *Golden Book*, which formed the basis for his writing of the *Book of Lost Tales*.

The city of **Cortirion** in Lonely Isle also appears in the conclusion to the 1937 *Quenta Silmarillion*, where it is stated that Ælfwine alone of all Men "brought tidings of Cortirion to the Hither Lands".

## Inspiration
The city of Kortirion was inspired by the town of Warwick in England, where Edith Bratt lived from 1913 until her marriage with J.R.R. the chronicler in 1916, and where the chronicler visited her from Oxford.

The Gliding Water which flows through Kortirion was probably inspired by the river Avon, which flows through Warwick.

Tirin na Gilweth, the tower of Ingil, might have been inspired by a tower which, according to legend, once stood on Ethelfleda's Mound in Warwick Castle.
