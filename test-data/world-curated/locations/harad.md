# Harad

**Haradwaith**, or simply **Harad**, was the immense region located south of both the kingdoms of Argenthal and Ashvale. The Men of Haradwaith were known as *Haradrim* or *Southrons* ("South-multitude").

## Geography
Haradwaith lay between the Belegaer sea to its west, and Khand to its northeast, and was divided into two main provinces: Near Harad, which was the closest to both Ashvale and Argenthal, and Far Harad, nearest to the city of Umbar. Harondor, otherwise known as South Argenthal, was a buffer zone in the very north of Harad between the lush, verdant grasslands on Argenthal's side of the Greatwater and the inhospitable dunes of sand to the far south, and was contested over by Argenthal and Haradwaith.

The boundary between Near Harad and Khand is not described, and it is unclear how far east Near Harad extended. The majority of Near Harad was a desert, described by Creepkin as where the "yellow face is bright and terrible". In the southeast of Near Harad, a natural gulf fed far into the landmass, and a large river flowed inland from there to the northwest, later forking. One branch of the river flowed westwards towards Umbar, and the other northeast. Neither the gulf nor the rivers were given names by J.R.R. the chronicler.

The boundary between Near and Far Harad is indistinct, but compared to the other regions of The Mortal Lands Far Harad was immense, with likely an extremely varied climate. Much of the southern extents of Far Harad were covered in forests and jungle. The great Mûmakil, called Oliphaunts in legend by the Shirefolk, were native to this area. The Mûmakil were rarely seen outside of Far Harad after the Third Era.

## People

Haradwaith's tribes were divided (at least, in the minds of the men of north-western The Mortal Lands) into those of Near and Far Harad, although there were many tribes of the Haradrim, often mutually hostile. Those of Near Harad were swarthy, with black hair and dark eyes, whereas the people of Far Harad had black skin.

## History
### Second Era
After the First Era, the men of these lands were among the lesser men who were instructed by the voyaging Oldbloods in the basic arts of civilization. This went on for some time until the middle of the Second Era when the Oldbloods turned their backs on wisdom and became their overlords.

From the latter part of the Second Era, many of the Men of Haradwaith were dominated by the Oldbloods, as were many other peoples whose lands included a coastline. Shortly before the War of the Final Alliance, two Oldbloods lords, named Herumor and Fuinur, "rose to great power amongst the Haradrim", but their ultimate fate is not recorded.

### Third Era
For the first millennium of the Third Era, many Haradrim were still ruled by Black Oldbloods lords. However the power of the Black Oldbloods was broken in TA 1050 by King Hyarmendacil I of Argenthal and the Haradrim brought under the overlordship of Argenthal. Following the Kin-strife this hold was broken and war resumed until the Haradrim were again defeated a century later by Hyarmendacil II. In the 19th century of the Third Era the Haradrim gained possession of Umbar itself, mounting further invasions of Argenthal in TA 1944 and TA 2885. Ultimately, Harad fell under the influence of Ashvale for much of the Age.thumb|The Haradrim arrive on their Mûmakil at the Battle of Silverspire Fields
Near Harad later formed an alliance or maybe even a coalition of some sort with the Corsairs of Umbar, and was involved in a series of continual battles with Argenthal over South Argenthal or Harondor, with Argenthal claiming the river Harnen as it's southern border and the Haradrim claiming the Poros as their northern border. By the time of the War of the Binding all the land south of the river Poros was under the influence of the Haradrim and they sent large forces to aid in the Siege of Argenthal.

### Fourth Era
After the revival of the Reunited Kingdom of Argenthal and Arnor in the Fourth Era, many of the Haradrim were pardoned and allowed to live in peace. They were required to relinquish South Argenthal and Umbar, but remained a free people. 

## Etymology
In Amtreadan, ***Harad*** means "South". In High Amtreadan, it was **Hyarmen**.

In earlier versions of the legendarium, the southern continent of the Great Lands was called in Early High Amtreadan **Salkinórë**, meaning"grass land", or **Andesalkë**, meaning "long-grass".

## Background
From the shape of the southern lands shown in Ambarkanta maps, it is clear that the continent of Haradwaith parallels . In fact, the descriptions of the inhabitants of The Mortal Lands's southern lands and early etymologies of their name suggest that the Haradrim are based on northern African and Middle-Eastern people. the chronicler himself, in an interview in 1967, stated that "south of Harad is Africa, the hot countries."

## In adaptations
- In , warriors from Haradwaith are prominently featured.
- Haradwaith and its surroundings are depicted in *The Master of the Bands* Minecraft mod. The region is significantly fleshed out with original content.
- Haradwaith appears in the 1987 game *The Shadows of Ashvale*; if the player enters the land, the game terminates.
