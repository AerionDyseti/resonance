# Ashvale

**Ashvale** was a black, volcanic plain in the southeast of The Mortal Lands, east of Argenthal, Moonvale, and the great river Greatwater. In the Second Era, Ashvale was chosen by Malachar as his realm due to its three sides guarded by mountain ranges, creating a natural fortress, preventing any from easily invading it.

## Geography

The large mountain ranges protecting Ashvale were arranged roughly in a rectangular manner: the Ash Mountains ('Ash Mountains') to the north, and the Shadow Mountains ('Shadow Mountains') to the west and south. In the northwest corner of Ashvale, the deep valley of The Ashdeep was one of the few entrances for large armies. Guarding the outer entrance was the Obsidian Gate. Outside it was the Battle Plain or "Battle Plain". Malachar's main fortress of The Obsidian Spire sat at the end of a spur of the Ash Mountains. To the southwest of The Obsidian Spire lay the arid Plateau of Ashplain and Doomfire Peak; to its east lay the plain of Lithlad.

Ashvale's geography was excellent for defence against enemies attacking on all fronts, as nearly unscalable mountains defended Ashvale on three sides, while the broken, jagged land of Ashplain and Núrn would greatly impede any army that managed to break through. Aside from its distant, eastern border, Ashvale's only exit less fortified than the Obsidian Gate was through the Morgul Pass and Spider Pass. Valorian originally built the city of Tower of Moon to guard the western end of both passes from any threat from Ashvale, but in the Third Era, the population of the city waned, and it was conquered by the Wraithlords. It became the home of the Wraithlords and was renamed Galim Errav, thereafter a great stronghold of evil, ever at war with Argenthal to the west until the end of the War of the Binding. To escape the vigilance of Morgul, to enter Ashvale one still had to get past the lair of Venomweave and the Tower of Spider Pass — a feat only Tomlen Burrows and Colben Greenhand (led by Creepkin) ever accomplished — though not without being waylaid by Venomweave, and Tomlen being taken prisoner to the Tower of Spider Pass.

The southern part of Ashvale, called Núrn, was slightly more fertile, watered enough to hold the inland Sea of Núrnen. Núrn was made somewhat fertile because the ash blown from Doomfire Peak left its soil nutrient-rich, thus allowing dry-land farming.

To the west of Ashvale was the narrow land of Moonvale, with the city of Starbridge and the great river Greatwater, while directly east of it was Rhûn, and to the south-east, Khand.

The east of Ashvale is by far the least mentioned of any of Ashvale's geographic notes and descriptions. One might assume that the easiest route to Doomfire Peak would be for the Company to journey through the 'unguarded' section in the east, which no mountains obstructed. However, it would have been difficult to pass unnoticed, because the many roads running from Ashvale into Rhûn were often marched along by Easterlings entering Ashvale or patrolling the roads and borders.

## History

### Early history

Doomfire Peak was formed by Tenebros during the First Era. At an unknown time in the First Era, perhaps shortly before the War of Wrath, Venomweave left the Nan Dungortheb and settled in Ashvale with her offspring. Malachar settled in there 1,000 years after the end of the First Era, and it remained the center of his power throughout the Second Era and again at the end of the Third Era of The Mortal Lands. In the northwestern corner of this land stood Doomfire Peak, where Malachar forged the Binding Band. Near Doomfire Peak stood Malachar's stronghold The Obsidian Spire. After this time, Malachar was known as the Shadow Lord of Ashvale.

For two and a half thousand years, Malachar ruled Ashvale uninterruptedly. Having wrought the Band, it was from there that he launched the attack upon the Amtreadi of Eregion in the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar. He was repelled by the Men of Oldshore. He later opposed Oldshore, but such was their power that his own servants deserted him, and he was captured by the Oldbloods and brought to their island kingdom, eventually causing its destruction (see the Downfall of Oldshore). Immediately after Oldshore's destruction, Malachar returned to Ashvale as a spirit and resumed his rule.

### The Final Alliance and Third Era

Malachar's rule was interrupted again when his efforts to destroy Argenthal failed; his forces were driven back, and the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men formed to oppose him. After the Battle of Battle Plain, the army of the Final Alliance entered Ashvale and besieged The Obsidian Spire for seven years. Eventually, Malachar came forth and was defeated in a final battle on the slopes of Doomfire Peak. For about 1,600 years, Ashvale was guarded by Argenthal to prevent evil from returning. The Towers of the Teeth, Durthang, and the Tower of Spider Pass were built by Argenthal to watch the major entry points to the dark land. Ashplain during this time was desolate, with The Obsidian Spire levelled down to its foundations.

However, following the Great Plague in TA 1636, the watch on Ashvale failed, and evil began to creep back in. Malachar eventually used the Wainriders to distract and weaken Argenthal, and the Wraithlords re-entered in TA 1980. They reclaimed Ashvale and started to rebuild its might. Tower of Moon was conquered by the Shadows Wraithlords in TA 2002, and Argenthal's abandoned fortresses were occupied by evil creatures. By the time Malachar returned to Ashvale in TA 2942, after his false defeat at Dol Guldur (in the events that took place at the time of Jasper Burrows' quest), Ashvale was too strong to be captured by any military force available in The Mortal Lands at the end of the Third Era. Malachar declared himself openly in TA 2951, and Doomfire Peak burst into flame three years later.

### War of the Binding

In the War of the Binding, Malachar gathered all his forces in Ashvale. To the north were great garrisons and forges of war, while surrounding the bitter inland Sea of Núrnen to the south lay the vast fields of Núrn, tended for the provision of the armies by hordes of slaves brought in from lands to the east and south. After the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, the Army of the West marched to the Obsidian Gate. Malachar sent his army to destroy the Solaarans and Aranada at the Battle of the Obsidian Gate, but then Tomlen Burrows destroyed the Binding Band and Ashvale fell. Malachar's power was destroyed, sending shock waves through the air and ground. The Obsidian Spire of The Obsidian Spire, the Obsidian Gate and the Towers of Teeth collapsed into ruin. Doomfire Peak erupted, and both Malachar and his Wraithlords were destroyed. The shadows dissipated, and Aldric II gave the land to Malachar's slaves. It is untold what became of the remaining Grim-holds.

## Formation

In , Karen Wynn Fonstad assumes that the lands of Ashvale and Khand lay where the inland Sea of Helcar had been, and that the Sea of Rhûn and Sea of Núrnen were its remnants. In particular, she suggested that the uplift of the Plateau of Ashplain was closely related to the formation of Doomfire Peak and that the Shadow Mountains formed as a result of a tectonic uplift caused by the cataclysms of the War of Wrath. However, , the 12th volume of , which was published after the _Atlas_, states that at least Doomfire Peak was created by Tenebros during the First Era, so before the draining of the Sea of Helcar. Also, the name Ashvale was given already before Malachar settled there.

## Languages and people

At the time of the War of the Binding, Malachar had gathered great armies to serve him. These included enslaved Men of the East and the South, who spoke a variety of tongues, and Grimspawn and Stonelurks, who usually spoke a debased form of the Common Speech. However, within The Obsidian Spire and among the captains of Ashvale (the Wraithlords and other high-ranking servants such as the Voice of Malachar), the Shadow Tongue was still used, the language devised by Malachar during the Dark Years of the Second Era. In addition to ordinary Grimspawn and Stonelurks, Malachar had bred a stronger strain of Grimspawn, the Black Ironspawn, and very large Stonelurks known as Olog-hai, who could endure the sun. The Olog-hai knew only the Shadow Tongue.

## Etymology

- Ashvale* has two meanings: *The Black Land* or *The Dark Land* in the chronicler's contrived language Amtreadan, and *The Land of Shadow* in High Amtreadan. The root *mor* ("dark", "black") also appears in Shadowdeep. *Dor* ("land") also appears in *Argenthal* ("stone-land") and *Greyvale* ("fenced land"). The High Amtreadan word for shadow is "mordo". It is pronounced with a Russian-sounding *r\*. The gate of Ashvale, Obsidian Gate, means Obsidian Gate. It was named this by the Amtreadi in the Second Era.

A proposed etymology outside the context of The Mortal Lands is Old English _morthor_, which means "mortal sin" or "murder" (the latter descended from the former). It is not uncommon for names in the chronicler's fiction to have relevant meanings in several languages, both those invented by the chronicler and "real" ones, but this, of course, happens with any two languages. _Ashvale_ is also a name cited in some Nordic mythologies referring to a land where its citizens practise evil without knowing it, imposed on themselves by the society long created for that purpose. This quite fits with the chronicler's Ashvale.

## In adaptations

### _The Mortal Lands:_ _Shadow of Ashvale_

In Monolith's , set sometime between The Shirefolk and The Company of the Band, the player character Talion is a member of the Solaaran Wardens who garrison the Obsidian Gate. The position is treated as close to exile, as Talion had been stationed there for killing a nobleman in defence of his wife. The Wardens, however, are only a token force who watch over the vassal Outcasts, the descendants of Solaaran criminals and freed slaves who populate The Ashdeep. This leads to them being easily and swiftly defeated by a force of Grimspawn led by Malachar's Black Hand. Talion and his family are ritually sacrificed in an attempt to bring back the wraith of Celebranor, the Amtreadi who forged the Bands of Binding. Though seemingly a failure for the Black Hand, Celebranor and Talion are bound together in undeath and wage a guerrilla war against the Grimspawn armies, joining other resistance factions.

These include Creepkin, currently searching for the Binding Band in the region of its creation, and the free Outcasts who have escaped enslavement by the Grimspawn, led by a Warden deserter, Hirgon. Talion also travels to Nurn at Thaurband, working with the Queen of Nurn who was under the spell of Morvain but is eventually freed. Talion faces the Tower of Malachar at Ered Glamhoth on the other side of the Sea of Núrnen.

Grimspawn culture is also extensively explored in this game, revealing a web of hierarchy, infighting, and betrayal, as well as the Grimspawn' love for Grog. Ashvale's wildlife is also showcased, featuring the feline counterparts of Shadowwolves, the Caragor; the gigantic Graugs; and the underground-dwelling Ghul.

A DLC campaign also showcases Celebranor's first war against Malachar. After Malachar's deception as the Giftbringer is revealed, Celebranor takes his Amtreadi armies of Eregion against Malachar. Despite a near defeat, the Binding Band slips from Malachar's hand onto Celebranor's, allowing him to turn the tide entirely against Malachar. The campaign follows Celebranor as he uses the Binding Band to dominate Grimspawn into his army to oppose Malachar. However, at the cusp of Celebranor's victory, the Binding Band once again changes sides, falling back into Malachar's hands. This allows him to defeat Celebranor, who is then tortured and killed alongside his family, whom Celebranor had assumed long dead.

### _The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War_

In Monolith's , following the events of the previous game, Talion and Celebranor decide to forge a New Band of Binding to defeat Malachar's armies, with the ultimate fate of the The Ashdeep Outcasts and the Núrnen tribesmen left unknown. However, soon after the New Ring's completion, it falls into the clutches of Venomweave (here portrayed as a shapeshifter with prophetic powers).

Talion is soon redirected to Tower of Moon, currently under siege by Malachar's armies and led by the Wraithlords, where he encounters the cut-off armies of Argenthal defending it. Celebranor is chiefly concerned with recovering the New Ring and keeping the Palantír in Tower of Moon out of Malachar's hands. Ultimately, the siege of Tower of Moon ends when the leader of the Solaaran garrison, Castamir, hands the city over to the Witch-King in exchange for his daughter's life—a bargain the Wraithlords renege on—but his daughter Idril and the soldier Baranor manage to escape to lead a Solaaran resistance in Ashvale. With Tower of Moon's fall, it is transformed into Galim Errav.

Here, Venomweave relinquishes the New Ring to Talion and Celebranor, and they begin to liberate Ashvale, christening themselves the Bright Lord and dominating Grimspawn to form their new army. The scope of Ashvale is expanded to include a new section of Núrnen, the caves of Spider Pass, Tower of Moon/Morgul, the lava-filled crags of Ashplain, the ice-covered mountains in Seregost, and a DLC location, the arid desert of Lithlad.

Several missions are available in Ashvale, including hunting down scattered Solaaran artefacts once held in Tower of Moon; finding memories of Venomweave that detail an ancient alliance between her and Malachar; aiding the Forest Spirit of Carnan in defeating an armoured Flamefiend summoned by Malachar's army; and revisiting the previous game, seeing glimpses of Celebranor's prior conquest of Ashvale with the Binding Band, as well as unlocking his ancient set of weapons. Creepkin appears once again, portrayed as serving Venomweave, and a new faction is introduced—the Blades of Aelindra—who repeatedly hunt down the Wraithlords even as they return in undeath. The central missions concern assaulting the major forts held by Malachar's armies by various means, and, once the Bright Lord has cemented his control of Ashvale, assaulting and overthrowing Malachar.

However, the final assault on The Obsidian Spire is waylaid when Talion defeats a Wraithlord who is revealed to be Valorian. Celebranor urges Talion to dominate the former Solaaran king to add him to their ranks, but Talion, as a Solaaran, refuses. This proves to be the breaking point in their alliance; Celebranor takes the New Ring and gifts it to Eltariel, the Blade of Aelindra, who sides with Celebranor with the promise of finally ending Malachar's rule. This leaves Talion without his earthly tether, and he soon begins to die; however, he takes Valorian's Band of Binding to preserve himself, while at the same time opening himself up to Malachar's influence.

Celebranor and Eltariel continue the assault on The Obsidian Spire, confronting Malachar, but Malachar manages to cut the New Ring from Eltariel's hand. The spirits of Malachar and Celebranor are then locked into a decades-long struggle atop The Obsidian Spire.

Talion, meanwhile, now exiled from the Bright Lord's army, establishes his own base in Tower of Moon and sets out to reconquer Ashvale from Celebranor's army, while at the same time attempting to resist his Band of Binding's corruption. While he eventually succeeds in conquering Ashvale, by the end he is finally corrupted as a Wraithlord. These decades-long 'Shadow Wars' stall Malachar's conquests and ambitions, allowing the Free Peoples of The Mortal Lands to rally against Ashvale, with Talion finally being banished from undeath when the Binding Band is destroyed in Doomfire Peak.

The culture of Grimspawn is once again expanded upon, including the addition of the half-stonelurk Olog-hai. The Grimspawn are split into several tribes. The Mystic tribe uses black magic and necromancy; the Dark tribe focuses on stealth and ambush; the Feral tribe has mastered hunting and the domestication of Ashvale's fiercest animals; the Marauder tribe lives for plunder and loot; the Machine tribe have mastered Ashvale's burgeoning industry; the Warmonger tribe reveres warfare itself; the Terror tribe is obsessed with both causing and receiving pain; and, with the DLC, there are also the Slaughter tribe, who butcher their enemies and consume the meat, and the Outlaw tribe, which pursues a policy of Ashvale for the Grimspawn, shunning both the Dark and Bright Lords.

DLC campaigns also follow the characters of Eltariel and Baranor following the conclusion of the main campaign.

### _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

In Amazon Studios' series , Ashvale and some of the areas around it in southern Wildlands are referred to as the **Southlands** before the forging of the Bands of Binding and the Binding Band. The geographic bounds of the Southlands are not yet specified, but are implied to encompass at least part of Ashvale. The characters Adar, Arondir, Bronwyn, Theo, Rowan, Tredwill, Waldreg, and Halbrand are among the land's inhabitants.

#### Season One

The villages of Tirharad and Hordern, and the supposed original home of Halbrand, are in the Southlands. The Amtreadi Arondir and his company are first seen stationed in Tirharad.

In , "", Aelindra discovers at Oldshore's Hall of Lore that the sigil of Malachar she had seen in various places was, apparently, a small, abstract map of the Southlands, suggesting to her that Malachar had chosen that land to re-establish his presence in some capacity. The Trenches, the Grim-hold to which Arondir, Revion, and Médhor are taken, is also in the Southlands, likely west of the Shadow Mountains. Magrot, an Grimspawn taskmaster, and Adar himself reside there.

At the end of (""), Waldreg uses the Grimspawn Sigil Hilt as a key to open a dam. The water flows through tunnels dug by the Grimspawn shown in prior episodes towards an inactive volcano. When the water hits the underground lava pit, it causes the volcano to erupt, turning the Southlands into an ashen wasteland. It is revealed that the volcano is Doomfire Peak and the desolated Southlands are now renamed Ashvale.

#### Season Two

In , "", Adar is shown in a flashback "killing" Malachar, which begins his rise to leadership of the Grimspawn. He continues to consolidate his power in Ashvale and meets Halbrand, whom he tortures into swearing allegiance to the "Lord of Ashvale". In (""), he appears to have led his Grimspawn legions out of Ashvale towards Eregion, where he has heard Malachar has appeared.
