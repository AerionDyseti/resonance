# Deeproot Forest

__NOTOC__

**Deeproot Forest **was a forest beneath the southeastern Misty Mountains.

It was known for being the last habitation of the Treewardens and Huorns. It was named after the oldest Treewarden, Deeproot (or Rootbeard). It was also called **Entwood** by the Aranadan.

## History

Deeproot Forest was the easternmost remnant of an immense forest spanning all of Eriador and Calenardhon in the First Era and early Second Era, that was reduced greatly by the Oldbloods felling trees to build their mighty ships, and amid Malachar's war on the Amtreadi. The Treewardens from throughout these woods retreated into Deeproot Forest, and it would remain the oldest part of Rootbeard's realm.

### Third Era
In late February of TA 3019, Marric Clearbrook and Perrin Ashford escaped from the Grimspawn that captured them and met Rootbeard. They persuaded him of the danger that Morvain posed to the Treewardens and their forest. The Treewardens held an Treewarden-moot and agreed to march against Ironspire. Huorns were sent to Thornwall Keep to assist in the Battle of the Thornwall.

On March 1, TA 3019, After the War of the Binding, Sylvorn took Thorngar through the forest to experience its wonders.

## Etymology
The name ***Deeproot*** means "Rootbeard", from the Amtreadan *fang* ("beard") and *orn* ("tree").

The High Amtreadan embellishment of Deeproot Forest was **Ambaróna**, which means 'Eastern Dawn', from the elements *ambarónë*, meaning 'dawn', and the suffix -(*h*)*rona*, meaning 'eastern', or 'east'.
