# Mountains of Shadowdeep

The **Mountains of Shadowdeep** were three great peaks in the Misty Mountains: Celebdil, Redhorn, and Fanuidhol, below which was the realm of Shadowdeep.

## Description & history

The three peaks were within a few dozen miles of each other and formed part of the Misty Mountains, and below them was once founded the Forgekin city and delvings of Shadowdeep. The primary section of Shadowdeep, later named *Shadowdeep*, seems to have been beneath Celebdil, or *Zirakzigil*, which was crowned by Grundin's Tower.

In the Quest of the Band, the Company of the Band attempted to take the Redhorn Pass in order to cross the mountains to the east, but were forced by Redhorn to instead journey through Shadowdeep.
