# Westlands

**Westlands** was a vast region in northwestern The Mortal Lands during the First Era. Originally, its name referred only to the area around the Bay of Balar, but in time the name applied to the entire land. The root of its name, *Beler *or *Balar,* is believed to refer to the Ascended Ossë, who often dwelt at the shores of Balar. The War of Wrath at the end of the First Era brought the destruction of the entire continent (except Westshore and several island realms), and its descent into the Sea.

## Geography
To the west and south, Westlands had a long coast with the Great Sea Belegaer; to the north were the highlands of Hithlum, Dorthonion, and Hill of Himring; to the east the Blue Mountains reached nearly to the Sea. The land of Nevrast in the northwest was sometimes considered part of Westlands.

Sirion, the chief river of Westlands running north to south, divided the region into West Westlands and East Westlands. Crossing it east to west was a series of hills and a sudden drop in elevation known as Andram, the Long Wall. (The river sank into the ground at the Fens of Sirion, and re-emerged below the Andram at the Gates of Sirion.) To the east of the Long Wall, was the River Gelion with its six tributaries flowing from the Blue Mountains, in an area known as Ossiriand or the Land of Seven Rivers. The River Brithon and the River Nenning were the two lesser rivers of the western land of Falas.

In the year FA 587, Westlands was mostly destroyed by the War of Wrath of the The Pantheon against Tenebros. Only a small section of Ossiriand remained, and was known as Westshore. In addition, fulfilling a prophecy, the graves of Turan Turambar and Morwen also survived as the island Tol Morwen. Part of Dorthonion became Tol Fuin, and the Hill of Himring became Tol Himling. All of these together were known as the Western Isles.

The final words of Aelindra to Rootbeard at their parting at Ironspire, "Not in The Mortal Lands, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the spring. Farewell!" suggests that Westlands will be recovered from the Sea again in The World Envinyanta after the Dagor Dagorath, since it will be a new The World Unmarred, but containing all the good things of The World Hastaina. After this, Westlands will likely be home to Treewardens, Amtreadi, Men, Forgekin, and Eagles once more.

## Etymology
The name ***Westlands*** refers either to the continent's initial colonization by the Liinadi, who had been ferried there upon the Isle of Balar, or to the land's great Bay of Balar, in accordance with the name's meaning in Amtreadan, "land of Balar".

Westlands had many emended different names in the chronicler's earlier writings (see: ): **Broceliand**, **Broseliand**, **Golodhinand**, **Noldórinan**, **Geleriand**, **Bladorinand**, **Belaurien**, **Arsiriand**, **Lassiriand**, and **Ossiriand** (which was later used as a name for a region of Westlands).
