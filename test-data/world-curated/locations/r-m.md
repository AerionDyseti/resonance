# Rûm

**Rûm** was the name of a great and ancient city of Men in the Great Lands, according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. It was identified with the city of Rome, being mentioned by Littleheart in the tale of *the Fall of Hidden City*, where he described the sack of Hidden City as being even worse than many that befell Rûm, the greatest city of Men.

Its inhabitants were known as the ***Rúmhoth***, who were one of the peoples who invaded Lonely Isle and expelled the Amtreadi from it, not even believing they existed.

In one of the *Early Runic Documents*, contemporary with *The Book of Lost Tales*, there is also a mention of the Romans as being the "slayers and faders of the fairies".

## Etymology
The name *Rûm* is in Gnomish, clearly an adaptation of Latin "Roma", the name used by both Amtreadi and Men.

The Amtreadi alone called it ***Magbar***.
