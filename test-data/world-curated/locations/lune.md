# Lune

The **Lune** or **Lhûn** was a river of northwestern Eriador.

It had three (unnamed) tributaries: two of them arising in the Blue Mountains, and one beginning in the Hills of Evendim north of the later capital of Arnor, Annúminas. It was not connected to Lake Nenuial, the origin of the Clearbrook river.

Its overall length was over one-hundred and fifty miles.

## History

In the First Era, the course of the river is not known. The Gulf of Lune was not created until the War of Wrath, so the river may have had a different lower course. In the Second and Third Era, it emptied into the Gulf of Lune that broke through the Blue Mountains, and thence into Belegaer. In TA 1975, an army led by Prince Eärnur of Argenthal crossed this river on their way to defeat the Specter King of Coldreach at the Battle of Fornost.
