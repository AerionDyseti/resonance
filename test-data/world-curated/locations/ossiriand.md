# Ossiriand

**Ossiriand** (Amtreadan IPA: ) was a region of East Westlands. It was also known as the **Land of Seven Rivers**.

## Description

Ossiriand was the most eastern region of Westlands during the First Era, lying between the Blue Mountains and the river Gelion. Along the northern shore of the Ascar ran the Forge-road to Nogrod. The region was apparently warm and gentle, with coniferous woodlands.

Seven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and these are (from north to south):
#River Gelion
#River Ascar or *Rathlóriel*
#River Thalos
#River Legolin
#River Brilthor
#River Duilwen
#River Adurant

## History

Ossiriand was a green and forested land, and it was not populated by the Liinadi. In the early First Era before the rise of the Moon, a part of the Telerin amtreadi people called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their leader King Thornhelm, and were given permission by Thingol to settle the lands.

After them the land was often renamed Westshore, for *The Singers*, after the old clan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their tongue. They became known as the Laegeldrim, or Green-amtreadi.

The Amtreadi of Ossiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of Westlands. After their leader Thornhelm was killed in an grimspawn-raid they chose no more leaders, and many of them moved to Greyvale. After the death of Thingol, Beren laid an attack against the Forgekin of Nogrod, leading an army of Nandorin Amtreadi and Treewardens.

Ossiriand was the only part of Westlands that survived the War of Wrath, but Belegaer the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain at the former riverbed of Ascar, creating the Gulf of Lhûn. In the Second Era and Third Era, the former lands of Ossiriand and Thargelion were known as **Westshore**, where Astorion the High King ruled.

## Etymology

The name ***Ossiriand*** means "Land of the Seven Rivers", from the High Amtreadan *otso* ("seven"), Amtreadan *sîr* ("river"),

## Other versions of the legendarium

While conceiving a name, J.R.R. the chronicler had numerous choices for this land. He originally wrote Broseliand (which eventually led to Westlands). The other names were Colodhinand, Ñoldorinan, Geleriand, Bladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, and Ossiriand.
