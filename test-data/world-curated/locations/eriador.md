# Eriador

**Eriador** was a large region situated in northern The Mortal Lands. It was located between the Blue Mountains (to the west) and the Misty Mountains (to the east).

## Description
According to *The Atlas of The Mortal Lands*, Eriador was about six-hundred miles (approximately 960 kilometers) from east to west. It was mostly lowlands. Hilled areas were the Hills of Evendim, North Downs, South Downs and Weather Hills in the center of the region, the White Downs and Tower Hills in the west, and in the east the Ettenmoors, Coldfells, and foothills of the Misty Mountains. The north of Eriador and the south of Minhiriath were flat, wide plains. A plateau area existed in the area where Galel Anastrael and the Trollshaws were located. Eriador was largely made up of scattered woodlands, with scrublands in the north and northeastern parts. The rest were short grasslands, mainly in the center of the region.

The climate was mainly humid, with relatively mild to cold winters. A constantly warm and moist prevailing wind blew over the Blue Mountains. In the northern part, cold and dry prevailing winds blow down from the polar north, influencing the climate as well.

Most of the population was concentrated in the central area, the core of the former kingdom of Arnor and the Shirelands, and the dominant language was Common Tongue at least by the Third Era.

### Boundaries

-  To the east: the Misty Mountains, east of which lay Rhovanion, the Wilderland.
-  To the north: the Northern Waste (Forodwaith) and—after the War of Wrath and ensuing floods which ended the First Era—the Ice-bay of Forochel.
-  To the west: the mountains of Ered Westshore (also known as Blue Mountains or Blue Mountains). On the far (i.e. western) side of these mountains lay the region of Westshore, which was virtually the only part of Westlands that had survived the First Era. The Mistport were located in a gap in the Blue Mountains, and it's not clear whether these havens (and the adjacent lands west of the Tower Hills) were part of Westshore or Eriador.
-  To the south: the rivers Glanduin and Greyflood (forming the border with the land of Enedwaith) and the shores of Belegaer west of Lond Daer Enedh.

Eriador extended for some 600 miles (960&nbsp;km) north-south and 700 miles (1120&nbsp;km) west-east. It was traversed by two main routes:
-  the East-West Road running from the Misty Mountains' High Pass (near Galel Anastrael) to the Mistport
-  the Greenway (formerly the North-South Road connecting the kingdoms of Arnor and Argenthal).

Important rivers were the Lune (Amtreadan *Lhûn*), the Clearbrook (Amtreadan *Baranduin*) and the Greyflood (Amtreadan *Gwathló*). Minor rivers included the Willowstream, Hoarwell [Amtreadan *Mitheithel*) and the Loudwater (Amtreadan *Bruinen*). Lake Evendim was the only lake of significant size, although there were smaller lakes and ponds such as Bybrook Pool.

### Major settlements

-  Annúminas, former capital of Arnor, ruined.
-  Fornost Erain, former capital of Arthedain, ruined.
-  Mistport
-  Galel Anastrael
-  Crossway
-  Michel Hollow
-  Tharbad, ruined
-  Ost-in-Edhil, former capital of Eregion, ruined.
-  Carn Dûm, former capital of Angmar, ruined.

## History
Little is recorded of Eriador's history prior to the Second Era. Both the Calaquendi Amtreadi and the Three Houses of the Edain would have passed through Eriador on their great westward journeys.

At the beginning of the Second Era, large populations of Middle Men inhabited the region, which was heavily forested. The Oldbloods however cleared vast areas to build their ships, leaving huge swathes of Eriador permanently denuded of trees. There was also a group of Ñoldorin exiles living in Eregion, near Shadowdeep and also located in the western-most region of Eriador (and also in The Mortal Lands) was the High Amtreadi Kingdom of Westshore, once the greatest and mightiest kingdom of Middle earth. Malachar's assault on the Amtreadi of Eregion laid waste to that land, with Eriador bearing the brunt of the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar.

In SA 3319 Aldorion landed in The Mortal Lands and founded the Kingdom of Arnor in Eriador the following year. In the War of the Final Alliance many Amtreadi were killed and a majority of Westshore's inhabitants sailed over the sea, bringing the Amtreadi kingdom (although not their presence) to an end. Having also taken heavy losses in the war, Arnor was depopulated as well. In the early Third Era it encompassed a large part of Eriador, although it soon split into three warring successor kingdoms, Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur 

Even after his fall, Malachar's evil spirit acted through his agents, such as the Specter King of Coldreach, and he also concocted virulent plagues which swept over the land. Between warfare against the surviving Duskwardens kingdoms, the Great Plague, and the general lawlessness sweeping over the land, the population dropped considerably. The Angmar war turned Eriador into a mostly wild and untamed land, by the time of the War of the Binding the remaining population centres were: The Amtreadi, either in the valley of Galel Anastrael or Westshore. The Duskwardens of Arnor in the Angle or dispersed, Middle Men in Crossway, Shirefolk in the Shirelands, Forgekin in the Blue Mountains and Grimspawn in the Misty Mountains.

In the Fourth Era the Kingdom of Arnor was re-founded, forming part of the Reunited Kingdom, which presumably expanded to include all of Eriador.

## Etymology
***Eriador*** is a Amtreadan word that meant 'Lonely land' or 'Lone-lands'.
