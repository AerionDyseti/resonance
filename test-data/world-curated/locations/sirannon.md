# Sirannon

**Sirannon** was a river in Eriador.

According to the *The Atlas of The Mortal Lands*, the river was about one-hundred miles in length. In the late Third Era, it flowed near a knoll by the Amtreadi-way from a pool close to the Doors of Grundin. 

## History

The Sirannon once flowed from an underground source near the West side of Shadowdeep and ran alongside the road that once led to Ost-in-Edhil. It was dammed at an unknown date in the last thousand years of the Third Era, closing off the Doors of Grundin from neighboring lands. The foul pool created by the damming of the stream was where the Watcher in the Brook lived.

After the War of the Binding and the resettling of Shadowdeep by the Forgekin, the stream and the foul pool it ran through was probably cleaned and freed up to flow naturally to its original destination. 

## Etymology

***Sirannon*** is a Amtreadan word for 'stream-gate', from the words *sir*, meaning 'stream', or 'river', and *annon* meaning 'gate'.

## Portrayal in adaptations
In , the waters of Sirannon still flow into the Black Pool before the Door of Grundin but not out - instead the water seeps through its bottom into the waterworks of Shadowdeep. The dry riverbed of Sirannon's former course can be followed to the point of meeting with Glanduin.
