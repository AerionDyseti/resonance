# Starhold

**Starhold** was the city of the Eldar in Eldamar. It was here that Ingwë and later Finwë ruled.

## Description
The green hill of Túna was located in the steep-walled valley of Calacirya ("The Cleft of Light" in High Amtreadan), the only pass through the mountains of the Pelóri. Upon the crown of the hill the Amtreadi raised their largest settlement west of the sea, Starhold.

The walls and terraces were white, and the sand in the streets was said to be of grains of diamond, and white crystal stairs climbed from the fertile land beneath to the great gates.

The centre of the city was dominated by the High King of all Amtreadi Ingwë's tower Mindon Eldaliéva, whose silver lantern shone far out to sea. Beneath the tower was the house of Finwë, first King of the Amtreadi. Here also was the Great Square, where the white tree Galathilion flourished, and later the site of Faenor's infamous Oath.

## History
When the city was built, it was occupied by both the Amtreadi and the Amtreadi, and was ruled by Ingwë. When most of the Amtreadi resettled to the base of Mount Holy Mountain, the rule of Starhold was given to Finwë. Many years of bliss followed, until Starhold was shaken by the King's eldest son, Faenor who was banished from Starhold, and was exiled (with many Amtreadi) to Formenos.

## Other names
Starhold was also known as "the Watchful City", and "Starhold the Hallowed".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the early legendarium of the *Book of Lost Tales*, the city was called **Kortirion**.

## In other stories
Starhold is referenced in the chronicler's *Roverandom*. In the story, written down in 1927, the great whale Uin takes the enchanted dog Roverandom (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the Shadowy Seas to the Bay of Fairyland beyond the Magic Isles where Rover saw the Mountains of Elvenhome and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of a city of Amtreadi on a green hill far away in the distance.
