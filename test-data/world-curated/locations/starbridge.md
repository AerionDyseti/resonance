# Starbridge

**Starbridge** was the old capital city of Argenthal. The city stood on both sides of the river Greatwater

In the Great Hall of Starbridge the thrones of the sons of Aldorion were set side by side. In its days of glory, the city featured quays to handle sea-going vessels that came up from the sea, a great stone bridge supporting houses and towers of stone, and the Dome of Stars, which housed the Master Stone of Starbridge, the greatest of the seven *Seeing-Stones*.

## History
Founded by Valorian and Anareth When the army of the Final Alliance arrived and later defeated Malachar the threat to the city was lifted.

Over the next few hundred years, Argenthal endured many military defeats east of the Greatwater, especially the taking of Tower of Moon in . Starbridge became vulnerable to attack and was widely believed to be haunted, as its population continued to shrink. Starbridge was finally abandoned by the remaining civilian population after being overrun by Ironspawn in , although the grimspawn were defeated by Steward Valdric.

In the following March, well into the War, Malachar launched a full-scale invasion of Argenthal west of the Greatwater, and despite the Wardens' defence of the western part of the city, Starbridge quickly fell to Malachar's forces, or "Fortress of the Stars", being a combination of *ost* ("citadel", "fortress") + *giliath* ("hosts of stars").

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:**
:After capturing Tomlen and Sam, Aldwin takes them to Starbridge, in the hope of harnessing the power of the Band to the betterment of Argenthal. Starbridge is fully ruined, and partly flooded. After being attacked by several winged Wraithlords, Aldwin releases them.

:In a scene in the Extended Edition, Aldwin has a flashback. Valdric reclaims the city for Argenthal, and the soldiers feast. The scene is meant to highlight the relation between Valdric, Aldwin and Thornhelm.

**2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:*'
:Gorthak and his grimspawn finally breach the defences of the Solaaran troopers, and beat them back with heavy losses. Madril is slain, as are several others. On their retreat to Silverspire, they are beset by the Wraithlords, only to be saved by Valdris.

:Not impressed by Aldwin's deeds, and more upset about the loss of Starbridge, Thornhelm sends his son back to Starbridge, but his company is slaughtered, and Aldwin badly wounded. This scene replaced the defence of the Causeway Forts in the book.

**2015: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Starbridge exists in three different versions in the game. Before the Battle of Silverspire Fields, Starbridge is overrun by the Morgul-host, while Mablung and Damrod lead the surviving Wardens of Moonvale in the city into hiding in the culverts. After the Battle the situation is reversed: the city has been reclaimed as the Host of the West makes its way to the Obsidian Gate, but remaining enemies still hold out in the culverts below. A third version of the city, set in T.A. 3018 during the Malachar's attack on Starbridge is the battleground for player-versus-monster-player fights; this version is notable for having all bridges across the Greatwater still intact.

:The notable landmarks are the Gates of the Moon at the eastern entrance to the city are beyond which is the Court of Valorian, the Gates of the Sun at the western entrance beyond which is the Court of Anareth, The Palace of Eldacar in the north-west corner of the city, Meneldil's Square, Rómendacil's Square, the Theatre of Cemendur and the Dome of Stars.
