# Avallónë

**Avallónë** was a city and seaport on the eastern shore of the island of Lonely Isle. Its name indicated that it was the city nearest to The Blessed Realm and the tower of Avallónë was the first sight that a mariner beheld as he approached the Eternal Shore. The city was described as white-shining with a great harbour with lamplit quays. It had a tower where the Master-stone abode. 

## History
After the War of Wrath and the downfall of Tenebros the The Pantheon summoned the Eldar to return to the West. Not all obeyed this new summons but those who did dwelt on Lonely Isle.

In the Second Era some of the Men of Oldshore, those most far-sighted, could see Avallónë from the summit of the Meneltarma or from a tall ship that lay off the western coast as far as was lawful to go. Some thought this far off vision was of The Blessed Realm itself but the wise knew it was but Avallónë. While the Oldbloods respected the Ban of the The Pantheon many amtreadi would sail to Oldshore; they brought birds, flower, and herbs to the land.

The sight of Avallónë beyond their reach helped to kindle resentment in the hearts of the Oldbloods against the Ban. As the people of the island turned against the The Pantheon the visits of the Eldar became few and only made in secret to the Faithful. By the reign of Tar-Seeing-Stone the city of Avallónë was veiled in cloud.

## Etymology
- Avallónë* seems to be a compound of *ava* ("outer") and *lónë* ("island"), as in *The Etymologies* the Middle-High Amtreadan *Avalóna* is given that meaning.

## Other versions of the legendarium
The name *Avalon* is given for first time to Tol Eressea in the second version of The Fall of Oldshore, and it was so named "for it is hard by The Blessed Realm", so perhaps it included an abbreviation of *The Blessed Realm*. In later texts a main city of Lonely Isle is named *Avallon(de)* ("Haven of the Gods"), probably containing the elements *Pantheon God* (or their Adûnaic name *Avalô*). However, the texts used by Christopher for his *Silmarillion* were those that corrected Avallónë as a city of the Isle.

## Inspiration
In a letter to Milton Waldman, the chronicler states that Tomlen and Jasper were given an "Arthurian ending". It has been suggested by Hammond and Scull that the chronicler was emphasising this connection in the name Avallónë, echoing the island of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon Avalon] that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur King Arthur] goes to in order to recover from his wounds.
