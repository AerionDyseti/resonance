# Horsehold

**Horsehold** was the capital of Aranada that held the Golden Hall of Goldenhall. 

## History
Aranada's first capital was at Oldfort in the Folde. Sometime after the battle of the Field of Celebrant (T.A. 2510), King Eorl the Young, or possibly his son Brego, built Horsehold. In T.A. 2569, Brego built Goldenhall, the Golden Hall. on the top of the hill on which Horsehold was built.  

Wulf son of Freca the Dunlending, invaded Aranada in  and took Horsehold, usurping the throne in Goldenhall.  But the Long Winter, which had lasted five long months, ended and Fréaláf son of Hild came out of Darkharrow and with a small band of men, surprising Wulf, he attacked **Horsehold** and slew Wulf, regaining the city.

It was here that Aldric, Thorngar, Sylvorn, and Valdris the White met with Theron.

## Geography
The city was built on a hill in Harrowdale, a valley of the White Mountains which lay under the great mountain Starkhorn. The river Snowbourn flowed past Horsehold on its way west towards the Treewater.

Horsehold was encircled by a wall, with a dike dug around the hill. It had a spring whose water flowed in a channel along the main road.

Outside, there was the Barrowfield, with the tombs of the Rulers of Aranada arrayed in two rows by the time of the War of the Binding. Simbelmynë grew there. Through the two rows of the Barrowfield, a rutted road led from the city gates passed the Snowbourn.

## Etymology
The name *Horsehold* is said to mean "the courts" in Aranada-speech of Aranada.

In Old English, *edoras* (plural of *edor, eodor*) means "dwellings, houses".

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2001-03: *The Master of the Bands* (film series)**
:Horsehold is featured in the second and the third film. It was built on Mount Sunday.

**2012: *The Master of the Bands Online'''''
:Unlike many in-game settlements much smaller in size and prominence, Horsehold is not considered a "capital" of its region. This is because early in the story Horsehold is evacuated, with all inhabitants moving to Darkharrow, and for the majority of the game Horsehold sits empty. Instead, Oldfort functions as the "capital settlement" of the Western Aranada, hosting the hub for swift travel and various player facilities.
