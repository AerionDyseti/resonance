## History
During the Great Journey in the Years of the Trees, the Eldar reached the Sea of Rhûn after marching 450 miles west or northwest from Cuiviénen. The Liinadi managed to reach new heights in their ship-making to traverse the Sea of Rhûn during this time.

During the westward migration of Men in the First Era, many tribes populated the shores of the Inland Sea. While the Lesser Folk arrived first and dwelt at the feet of some nearby hills, the Greater Folk that came later dwelt in Neldoreth before they resumed their migration to Westlands.

During the early Third Era, King Rómendacil I of Argenthal drove the Easterlings back to the lands around the Sea of Rhûn. His son, Turambar, expanded the kingdom to the East. By the time of King Hyarmendacil I, the Inland Sea was the eastern border of Argenthal.

Vorondil hunted the Kine of Araw near the shores of the Sea of Rhûn, though it is untold which side he did. Argenthal's eastern border was apparently further east than the Inland Sea during the time of Rómendacil II. noun *neldor* ("beech-tree; beech") and *-eth* ("abstract noun").
