# Himlad

**Himlad** was a cold land in East Westlands during the First Era. It lay between the rivers Aros and Celon in the northwest of Westlands.

## History

Himlad was held by Celegorm and Curufin before the Siege of Iron Fortress. When Aredhel was lost, she passed through Himlad until she found Nan Elmoth. Years later, when Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth to return to Hidden City, Eöl the Raknagadi crossed Himlad and was captured by the riders of Curufin.

This land was held by Celegorm and Curufin until the Battle of Sudden Flame in the latter part of the First Era.

## Etymology

***Himlad*** means "cool plain", from the Amtreadan *him* ("cool") and *lad* ("plain").
