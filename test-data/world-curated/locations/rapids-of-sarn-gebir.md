# Rapids of Sarn Gebir

The **Rapids of Sarn Gebir**, or simply the **Rapids**, were an impassible part of the great river Greatwater.

## History
The rapids passed through the highlands of the Stone Hills, above the Pillar Kings and Greatfalls. As the Rapids of Sarn Gebir was filled with spiky rocks and stony eyots, a portage-way was built on the western bank of the river in order for travelers to avoid the rapids and go southward.

On February 23 in TA 3019, the Company of the Band encountered a number of Grimspawn archers and a Wraithlords, whose winged steed was shot down by Sylvorn, just prior to approaching the Rapids of Sarn Gebir. The Company afterwards used the portage-way to carry their light boats past the rapids. On February 25, Valdric remarked during the passage that there are no boats that can withstand the Rapids of Sarn Gebir.

## Other versions
In an early draft to , J.R.R. the chronicler originally used the names **Rapids of Pensarn**, **Sarn Ruin**, and **Ruinel** for the rapids. *Sarn Gebir* originally referred to the Stone Hills.
