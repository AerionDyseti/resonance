# Araman

**Araman** was the narrow northern coastland of The Far West, north of The Blessed Realm, that lay outside the mountain-fence of the Pelóri.

It was deserted, mountainous, and frozen because of its neighbouring with the Helcaraxë, joining it with Westlands. The land may have consisted of tundra, but was dark in the age of the Two Trees, so might well have been totally desolate.

## History
Araman was the way Tenebros, and later the Ñoldor, took after their exile. Araman was the place where the departing Ñoldor heard the Prophecy of the North from a dark figure standing on a rock. After hearing the doom that would lay upon them if they continued to rebel, the host divided into those following Faenor who were resolved to return to The Mortal Lands after Tenebros to recover the Starstones, and those who followed Finarfin who returned to Starhold and repented their rebellion and chose to live in peace ever after in the Eternal Shore.

## Etymology
***Araman*** is a High Amtreadan word that meant 'Outside The Far West'. It contains the elements *Ar,* which means *outside of, alone*, and The Far West, the continent that the The Pantheon made and settled, and where they made the realm of The Blessed Realm
