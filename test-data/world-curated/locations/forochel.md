# Forochel

The area of Forodwaith that lay north of Eriador was known as **Forochel**, together with the great bay and cape which carried the same name. This area roughly corresponded with the area where the Blue Mountains and the Iron Mountains once met.

## History

It is speculated in* The Atlas of The Mortal Lands* that the ancient stronghold of Tenebros, First Darkness, was once located in Forochel, although this is not necessarily canonical. Forochel was inhabited by a tribe of brown skinned people called the Lossoth, or Snowmen. The chief of these tribes sheltered the Arthedain king Arvedui for a time, and was given the Band of Barahir as a reward. Arvedui soon left afterwards, and on his voyage back, the ship sank, due to a great storm.

## Etymology

***Forochel*** is a Amtreadan word that meant 'North-ice'.

## Appearances in adaptations
### Role playing games

**Forochel** and the regions surrounding the Icebay of Forochel are the subject of an extensive The Mortal Lands Role Playing publication, *The Northern Waste*.

### Video games

The area surrounding the Icebay of Forochel is among the regions fleshed out in . The lands around and between Lossoth settlements are available for exploration and adventuring.
