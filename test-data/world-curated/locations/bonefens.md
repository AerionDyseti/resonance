# Bonefens

The **Bonefens**, also known as the **Mere of Dead Faces**, was a wide area of dark stagnant marshes east of the Stone Hills and bordered on the east by the Battle Plain plain, site of the ancient Battle of Battle Plain during the War of the Final Alliance.

## History

The marshes predated the Battle of Battle Plain, but were not named until after the Battle of Battle Plain in the year 3434 of the late Second Era when the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men fought the forces of Ashvale. In the battle, many of the Galadhrim under Malgalad fled into the marshes where they were slain. These Amtreadi were later buried near the marshes, but over a long period of time, the graves were swallowed up as the marshes grew bigger. The water preserved the bodies and they remained visibly floating as dead faces which became Corpse-candles (High Amtreadan: _loikolíkuma_) sometime after. When the general Eärnil II came north and defeated the Wainriders in the Battle of the Camp, he drove their remnant into the Bonefens where most of them perished.

On February 1 of the year 3017, Aldric II entered the outskirts of the marshes, discovering and capturing Creepkin there before taking him to Gloomwood where he handed him over to Thornael

### The War of the Binding

During the quest to destroy the Binding Band in Doomfire Peak, Creepkin led Tomlen Burrows and Colben Greenhand through the marshes. They entered the Bonefens at dawn on March 1 of the year 3019. The passage was marked by lights and candles that danced about which Creepkin called "candles of corpses"; it is likely that those who became entranced by the lights and attempted to touch the bodies drowned in the water and went down to join the dead. Tomlen soon became entranced by these lights and attempted to reach out to feel the Ghosts Faces. Though Sam broke him out of his trance, Tomlen was able to catch a small glimpse of the history of the more fair Dead Faces. Creepkin then told them that the dead could not be touched, suggesting that he once attempted to do so in the past. While passing through the marshes, a Wraithlords on a Black Wing passed overhead, terrifying Creepkin enough that he started to slip into old speech-habits, which he had almost given up after swearing to serve the one who hold the ring. They exited the Marshes on the morning of March 2,

Tom Shippey elucidates on the resemblance of the Bonefens to a World War I battlefield in the 1996 documentary, _A Film Portrait of J.R.R. the chronicler_.

## In adaptations

### In _The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers_

In the of Peter Jackson's  in 2002, the Bonefens are shown as foggy ponds with jets of fire rather than the misty candle-flames described in the book. Tomlen actually falls into one of the ponds, in which ghostly figures appear, and surround and reach for him, before Creepkin pulls him out.

### In _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

In the of , Elanor Brandyfoot's family is shown to pass through the marshes as part of their migration east. The location is here known as the **Grey Marshes** since the events of Season One take place before the Battle of Battle Plain.
