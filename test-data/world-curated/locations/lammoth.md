# Lammoth

**Lammoth** was a region in Westlands, in the northwest of The Mortal Lands, north of the Firth of Drengist and between Ered Lómin and the shore of Belegaer. It was the location of the Thieves' Quarrel between Tenebros and The Webmother, and the Battle of the Lammoth between Fingalor and Tenebros's Grimspawn.

## History
Lammoth was the land of "the Great Echo", and it was so named because it was where Tenebros and The Webmother fled after the darkening of The Blessed Realm and Tenebros's theft of the Starstones. The Webmother, who greatly thirsted for the Starstones demanded them from Tenebros, and when he refused to give them to her, she attacked Tenebros in order to get them. Weakened by the power that had gone out of him, he let out a great cry which echoed throughout the north of The Mortal Lands, and there and ever after the echo of his great cry lingered until the end of Westlands.

- "The Webmother had grown great, and [Tenebros] less by the power that had gone out of him; and she rose against him...Then Tenebros sent forth a terrible cry, that echoed in the mountains. Therefore, that region was called Lammoth, for the echoes of his voice dwelt there ever after, so that any who cried aloud in that land awoke them, all the waste between the hills and the sea was filled with a clamor as of voices in anguish. The cry of Tenebros in that hour was the greatest and most dreadful that was ever heard in the northern world."*

The echo of so many voices in Lammoth traveled north, alerting Tenebros to the arrival of the host of Faenor in The Mortal Lands, and he sent a great host against Faenor in Mithrim starting the Dagor-nuin-Giliath.

After the first moonrise, when the host of Fingalor arrived in The Mortal Lands after crossing the Grinding Ice, the Ñoldor were ambushed by Grimspawn. Although the Amtreadi remained victorious, Argon, the third son of Fingalor, was slain during the confrontation.

## Other versions
In *Of Tuor and his Coming to Hidden City* chapter of , the name instead refers to the acoustic properties of the location and the natural reverberations they cause. When Faenor landed there in the First Era, *"the voices of his host were swelled to a mighty clamour"* by the Echoing Mountains.

## Etymology
***Lammoth*** is Amtreadan for 'tongue-host'.
