# Withered Heath

The **Withered Heath** was a region at the eastern extreme of the Grey Mountains in The Mortal Lands. There, the Grey Mountains broke into two spurs, north and south, between which was the Heath which was thought to have been the home of dragons.

## History
In the eastern part of their length, the Grey Mountains forked into two thin ranges, with a narrow valley between. On the floor of this long east-west valley between the mountains was a heath, but a heath burned and blackened by its inhabitants. This heath was famed and feared in the north of The Mortal Lands as the breeding-ground of the dragons. At one time they had infested the Grey Mountains and the lands beyond, and even in the closing decades of the Third Era, the dragon Scorath still terrorized the inhabitants of the north.

Scorath was the last of the great dragons, but lesser members of his kind remained, so perhaps these still occasionally returned to the Withered Heath to continue their race. However, in TA 2941 Durgan spoke of the Withered Heath as the place 'where the great dragons bred', implying that it was by then deserted, or at least not frequented by dragons that could be described as 'great'.

## In adaptations

The Withered Heath appears as a location in the *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II* video game. In Level Six of the Evil Campaign, the forces of Ashvale from Dol Guldur march to the Withered Heath, led by the Voice of Malachar, in hopes of gaining the allegiance of the dragons' leader, Drogoth the Dragon Lord. By killing the Forgekin forces and freeing the imprisoned offspring, Drogoth agrees to fight for Malachar with the promise of a Band of Binding, stolen many years ago from the Forgekin. The Withered Heath is also a playable skirmish battlefield.
