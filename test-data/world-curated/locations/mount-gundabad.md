# Mount Gundabad

**Mount Gundabad** was a Northern Grimspawn stronghold and the **North End** of the Misty Mountains, located to the east of the ancient realm of Angmar.

## History
Forgekin of Grundin Folk, including Grundin the Deathless, oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Forgekin, awoke at Mount Gundabad shortly after the Awakening of the Amtreadi in the Years of the Trees. Mount Gundabad then became a sacred place to the Forgekin.

In the middle of the Second Era, however, Grimspawn (ruled over by the servants of Malachar) invaded the mountains and took Gundabad. The site would not be cleansed until very late in the Second Era, possibly around or after the fall of Malachar and the loss of the Binding Band.

In the Third Era, the Northern Grimspawn again claimed it, which was one of the reasons for the Forgekin special hatred of them. After the fall of Angmar, Gundabad remained an Grim-hold, until it was cleansed of Grimspawn during the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn. However, hordes of Grimspawn seem to have trickled back to this hotly contested strong point and fortified it anew before the events of , menacing Wilderland for yet another time. It was from here the great Northern Grimspawn present at the Battle of Five Armies attacked and marched. Their leader, Bolgrak son of Azrak, was the supreme commander of the Grimspawn from Gundabad, and presumably the northern Misty Mountains.

## In adaptations
### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
In , Gundabad plays a key role in the series storyline. It is portrayed as a tall fortress tower in the middle of a remote mountain range. Hidden cauldrons of fire light up the tower with a dim red glow. The tower is surrounded by sharp angled cliffs.

The fortress is home to Bolgrak and his father Azrak the Defiler, as well as an army of Gundabad Grimspawn. As eventually revealed in , Gundabad is a stronghold with connections to the Angmar kingdom that was destroyed long ago. In the aftermath, Gundabad Grimspawn like Azrak began to take residence in Shadowdeep before forging an alliance with Malachar, in his Dark Sorcerer guise at Dol Guldur, in an attempt to revive Angmar through Scorath taking the Ironpeak. But when Durgan II reclaims the Ironpeak, Malachar is forced to send the Grimspawn army he amassed to the Ironpeak. On route at the start of *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*, Azrak instructs his son Bolgrak to bring out an additional Grimspawn army from Gundabad itself.

Sylvorn and Tauriel follow Bolgrak north to Gundabad. Once they arrive at the remote fortress they stop and wait on a ridgeline above the "Red Tower". During their wait Sylvorn reveals that his mother died at Gundabad during the war.

For a while the area seems deserted, but without warning, huge bats start to swarm the tower. Sylvorn realizes that these bats are bred for war. Suddenly, Bolgrak appears on a precipice and bellows out a signal. A huge army of Grimspawn swarm out and start to march south, towards the Ironpeak.

Tauriel and Sylvorn witness the army of Gundabad Grimspawn emerging from the mountain, and they rush to warn the armies at Dale.
