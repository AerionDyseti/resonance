## History

The Helcaraxë was first crossed by Tenebros and The Webmother after they destroyed the Two Trees. After being abandoned by the House of Faenor in Araman, Fingalor and his people braved this dangerous, frozen wasteland on their journey to The Mortal Lands. They endured great hardships and lost many including Elenwë, wife of Turgon, who perished in the crossing. This crossing of the Helcaraxë greatly diminished the original Host of Fingalor by the time they finally arrived in The Mortal Lands at the first rising of the Moon

## Earlier versions of the legendarium

The original names of the Helcaraxë in J.R.R. the chronicler's writings were ***Icefang***, ***Helcaraksë***, and ***Qerkaringa***.

## Inspiration
It is possible that the Helcaraxë was in part inspired by the ancient [https://en/Wikipedia.com/wiki/Beringia Beringia] land bridge. Both were formations that were later destroyed that a species used to cross into "new lands". thumb|right|250px|Turgon mourns the loss of his wife Elenwë in the Helcaraxë, by Marya Filatova
