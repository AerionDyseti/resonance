# Westshore

**Westshore** was a region of western The Mortal Lands. Initially populated by Laiquendi, in the following Ages it became an important Amtreadi realm, known for its harbors and ships that would embark unto the Uttermost West.

## Geography
Westshore was the name of the remnant of Ossiriand, a region west of the Blue Mountains, in East Westlands. After the deluge of Westlands in the War of Wrath, Westshore became the westernmost land of the continent of The Mortal Lands. The Gulf of Lune broke into Westshore and the Blue Mountains and divided the realm into *Forlindon* (North Westshore) and *Harlindon* (South Westshore). The eastern border of Westshore was the River Lune, beyond which was Arnor.

## History
### First Era
The name *Westshore* was first used by the exiled Ñoldor for the region of Ossiriand.

Westshore was the only part of Westlands that survived the War of Wrath, the rest of the continent having been broken or submerged by the tumults. However, the Sea broke through the Blue Mountains, creating the Gulf of Lhûn.

Many of the surviving Amtreadi of drowned Westlands, especially the exiled Ñoldor, relocated to Westshore by the beginning of the Second Era, where Astorion ruled.

### Kingdom of Astorion
Astorion founded the **Kingdom of Westshore** in SA 1, ruling over the Ñoldor, Liinadi, and all Amtreadi of Westshore alike. At this time the Havens, Mistport, and also likely Harlond and Forlond were built, from which many Amtreadi left for The Blessed Realm in subsequent years.

The Ñoldor mainly dwelt in Forlindon, and the Liinadi with remaining Green-amtreadi lived in Harlindon (a fief under the rule of Caelorn). Presumably, the surviving Edain also stayed for some time alongside the Amtreadi of Westshore, until they left for Elenna in SA 32. But there was some tension between the Amtreadi; some of the Liinadi did not wish to live under Astorion alongside the Ñoldor, and went to dwell among the Liinadi Amtreadi in the east, who were their Telerin kin Some Ñoldor also left to found Eregion in SA 700, the second of the two Ñoldorin realms.thumb|357x357px|Westshore in the Second Era.

In SA 600, Entulessë, a ship from Oldshore arrived in Mistport where Astorion welcomed the Oldbloods, who went on to re-establish contact with their distant kin, the Middle Men.

During the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar, Malachar overran Eriador. The Amtreadi called that time Days of Flight as many fled to Westshore where Malachar could not enter, and thence over the Sea to the Uttermost West. Eventually Tar-Minastir sent ships to Westshore, responding to Astorion's plea. The combined army of Amtreadi and Oldbloods drove Malachar's forces out of Eriador.

In the tumult following the Downfall of Oldshore, Westshore suffered great loss as "*the sea rode in upon the land*", and therefore had shrunk when the Third Era began.
### Rule of Harborel
After the War of the Final Alliance, most of the Ñoldor and many Liinadi departed for The Blessed Realm, and Westshore became depopulated, now ruled by Astorion's lieutenant, the Telerin Amtreadi Harborel the Shipwright, who kept building ships for the departing Amtreadi.

During the days of the Kings, most of the Amtreadi that still lingered in The Mortal Lands were found in Westshore. Beyond the Lune was Amtreadan country, green and quiet, where no Men went; but Forgekin dwelt in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially south of the Gulf of Lune, where they had mines in use. ("to sing, make musical sound") and *-on*, which is a common suffix for regions.

## In adaptations
### *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*
Westshore is the Amtreadi region ruled by Astorion from its capital, the Mistport, in the Second Era, and is considered the Capital of the Amtreadi. First glimpsed in , "", it is here that Thalion meets Aelindra after returning from her hunt for remnants of Malachar's forces in The Mortal Lands. This Mistport are portrayed as being split into a harbor area and a forested area on a bluff above the harbor where most of the activity happens in the series.
