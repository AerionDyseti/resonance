# Andúnië

**Andúnië** was an important city and port in the realm of Oldshore.
## Geography
It was located on the Bay of Andúnië in the Andustar region, on the western end of Elenna.  Part of the town lay beside the shore but many dwellings were set upon the steep slopes behind.  

The main road of Oldshore, which ran from Rómenna westward through Armenelos, continued on to Andúnië.

## History
Andúnië was initially the largest city of Oldshore because the Amtreadi of Lonely Isle would often visit the haven.

In , Tar-Aldorion created the title Lord of Andúnië in honor of his first grandson, Valandil. A distaff branch of the line of Elros, the Lords of Andúnië were important nobles and members of the Council of the Sceptre. Since Andúnië was an Amtread-haven, the Lords of Andúnië were also the leaders of the "Faithful" — those who advocated continued friendship with the Amtreadi and obedience to the The Pantheon. 

However, as the Shadow was falling upon Oldshore, Armenelos became larger and more important than Andúnië. By the close of the Second Era, the Faithful were labeled as traitors by the King's Men and deported to Rómenna in the east. Andúnië was ultimately destroyed in the Downfall of Oldshore in .

Amandil, the last of the Lords of Andúnië, was the ancestor of the Kings of Arnor and Argenthal in The Mortal Lands.

## Etymology
- Andúnië* is a variant of the High Amtreadan word ***andúnë***, meaning "sunset".
