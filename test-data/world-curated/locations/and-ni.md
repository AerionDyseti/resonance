# Galel Sunist

**Galel Sunist** was an important city and port in the realm of Oldshore.

## Geography

It was located on the Bay of Sunist in the Gal Sunist region, on the western end of Sunistor. Part of the town lay beside the shore but many dwellings were set upon the steep slopes behind.

The main road of Oldshore, which ran from Galel Fersun westward through Armenelos, continued on to Galel Sunist.

## History

Galel Sunist was initially the largest city of Oldshore because the Amtreadi of Lonely Isle would often visit the haven.

In , Tar-Aldorion created the title Lord of Sunist in honor of his first grandson, Valandil. A distaff branch of the line of Elros, the Lords of Sunist were important nobles and members of the Council of the Sceptre. Since Galel Sunist was an Amtread-haven, the Lords of Sunist were also the leaders of the "Faithful" — those who advocated continued friendship with the Amtreadi and obedience to the The Pantheon.

However, as the Shadow was falling upon Oldshore, Armenelos became larger and more important than Galel Sunist. By the close of the Second Era, the Faithful were labeled as traitors by the King's Men and deported to Galel Fersun in the east. Galel Sunist was ultimately destroyed in the Downfall of Oldshore in .

Amandil, the last of the Lords of Sunist, was the ancestor of the Kings of Arnor and Argenthal in The Mortal Lands.

## Etymology

_Galel Sunist_ is an Amtreadan compound meaning "City of the Western Sea" — from _galel_ (city, place for people) and _sunist_ (sea-motion, i.e., the direction of the setting sun over the sea).
