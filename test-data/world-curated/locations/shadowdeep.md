# Shadowdeep

**Shadowdeep**, originally known as **Hadhodrond** in Forgespeech (meaning "Forgekin-mansion"), was the grandest and most famous of the mansions of the Forgekin. There, for many thousands of years, a thriving Forgekin community created the greatest underground city ever known.

It lay in the central parts of the Misty Mountains, tunneled and carved through the living rock of the mountains themselves. By the Second Era a traveler could pass through it from the west of the range to the east.

## Etymology

The original Forgespeech name **Hadhodrond** means "Forgekin-mansion" or "Forgekin-delving." The Amtreadan name **Shadowdeep** (from _mor_ "black" + _iâ_ "void, abyss") means "Black Pit" or "Black Chasm." This name was given by the Amtreadi after The Deepflame awoke and the Forgekin were driven out in TA 1981. It is a name of fear and sorrow, given "without love" by the Amtreadi who preferred to live above ground.

## History

### Elder Days

It was founded in very ancient days by Grundin who awoke at Mount Gundabad in the Misty Mountains. He came upon the valley Tharkûn-bizar beneath the mountains. He looked into a shimmering lake and saw a crown of stars reflected in its waters. He named that lake Keled-tharak (the Mirrormere), and it remained a revered place among Forgekin of all houses ever afterwards. Grundin's Stone was erected on the location of that event.

There, in the caves above, Grundin and his people started the delving and building of the Great Gates of Shadowdeep, and the First Hall leading to a bridge over a chasm. From there began the expansion, both to _Levels_ above and to _Deeps_ below, and mines expanding out from the inhabited areas of the city proper.

As the centuries passed, the realm of Grundin became the greatest of all their mansions, and became famous even to the distant west.

### Second Era

In the Second Era, most of the Forgekin of the Blue Mountains began leaving en masse from their now ruined cities for Shadowdeep. The city was enriched not just in numbers, but in the western Houses' skills in smithing, crafting and masonry. All these factors created a renaissance for Shadowdeep, and brought its prosperity to its zenith.

Shadowdeep had expanded so much that it completely traversed the Mountains from east to west, ending to the western rocky cliffs at their base, the Walls of Shadowdeep. Narvi with the Lord of Eregion, Celebranor, constructed the magical West-gate of Shadowdeep.

Most of its great wealth was based on the rare _Truesilver_ that was found in its mines.

### Third Era

#### Demise

As the centuries passed, the Forgekin mined deeper and deeper for the precious Truesilver. In the year TA 1980, their deep digging unleashed a nameless terror - a Flamefiend from the Elder Days - that wreaked dreadful destruction. In slaying King Grundin VI, it became known as **The Deepflame**. In the following year, Grundin's son, Náin I, was also lost, and the Forgekin fled their ancient home.

After millennia as one of the richest cities in The Mortal Lands, Shadowdeep stood dark and empty, but for the brooding menace the Forgekin had released. In that time it was given a new name - Shadowdeep, the "Black Pit."

The monster - a Flamefiend of Tenebros, as was later known - lurked alone in Shadowdeep for nearly five hundred years. After that time, around TA 2480, Grimspawn made secret strongholds in the Mountains and Malachar started to populate the old city of Shadowdeep with his creatures.

#### The Company's Passage

In TA 3019, the Company of the Band attempted to pass through Shadowdeep. They were pursued by Grimspawn and ultimately confronted by The Deepflame on the Bridge of Shadowdeep. Valdris faced The Deepflame alone and fell with it into the abyss, though he was later returned to life as Valdris the White.

### Later History

The retaking of Shadowdeep by Grundin VII occurred sometime after the War of the Binding. As the King of Grundin Folk, he led a final return to the city. He was successful; the House of Grundin reclaimed their inheritance and the hammers rang again in their great halls beneath the Misty Mountains.

## Layout

Shadowdeep was a huge array of chambers, passages, mines, halls, stores and pits. In general, areas were either classed as the _Mines of Shadowdeep_ or the _city_. The mines were the working sections of Shadowdeep whilst the city contained the habitable parts.

The city of Shadowdeep was located close to the eastern end of Shadowdeep, near the Great Gates. They were structured into seven Levels and seven Deeps. The Levels stretched above the Great Gates with the First Level being on the same level as the Great Gates, whilst the Deeps were set deeper within the mountain below the level of the Great Gates.

Key locations included:

- **The Great Gates** (East-gate) - The main entrance
- **The West-gate** (Doors of Grundin) - Constructed by Narvi and Celebranor
- **The Bridge of Shadowdeep** - Where Valdris faced The Deepflame
- **The Chamber of Records** - Containing the tomb of Borin
- **The Twenty-first Hall** - Part of the northern expansion
