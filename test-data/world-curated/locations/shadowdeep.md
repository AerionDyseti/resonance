# Shadowdeep

**Shadowdeep**, latterly known as **Shadowdeep** (Amtreadan, "The Black Chasm", "The Black Pit"), was the grandest and most famous of the mansions of the Forgekin. There, for many thousands of years, a thriving Dwarvish community created the greatest city ever known. 

It lay in the central parts of the Misty Mountains, tunnelled and carved through the living rock of the mountains themselves. By the Second Era a traveller could pass through it from the west of the range to the east. 

## History
### Elder Days
It was founded in very ancient days by Grundin who awoke at Mount Gundabad in the Misty Mountains. He came upon the valley Azanulbizar beneath the mountains. He looked into a shimmering lake and saw a crown of stars reflected in its waters. He named that lake Kheled-zâram, the Mirrormere and it remained a revered place among Forgekin of all houses ever afterwards, and the Grundin's Stone was erected on the location of that event. 

There, in the caves above, Grundin and his people started the delving and building of the Great Gates of Shadowdeep, and the First Hall leading to a bridge over a chasm. From there began the expansion, both to *Levels* above and to *Deeps* below, and mines expanding out from the inhabited areas of the city proper.

As the centuries passed, the realm of Grundin became the greatest of all their mansions, and became famous even to the distant west; the Amtreadi of Westlands, heard its rumour from the Forgekin of the Blue Mountains on their borders. and his descendants continued to rule.

### Second Era

In c. , most of the Forgekin of the Blue Mountains began leaving en masse from their now ruined cities for Shadowdeep. The city was enriched not just in numbers, but in the western Houses' skills in smithing, crafting and masonry. All these factors created a renaissance for Shadowdeep, and brought its prosperity to its zenith.

Shadowdeep had expanded so much that it completely traversed the Mountains from east to west, ending to the western rocky cliffs at their base, the Walls of Shadowdeep. Narvi with the Lord of Eregion, Celebranor, constructed the magical West-gate of Shadowdeep.

It was also during this time that the Grimspawn reinvaded the mountains and made war on the Forgekin, taking Mount Gundabad from the Kingdom of Grundin.

### Third Era
#### Demise
Most of its great wealth was based on the rare *Truesilver* that was found in its mines, and as the centuries passed, the Forgekin mined deeper and deeper for the precious metal. In the year , their deep digging unleashed a nameless terror, a Flamefiend from the Elder Days, that wreaked dreadful destruction, and in slaying the  King, Grundin VI, became known as The Deepflame. In the following year, Grundin's son, Náin I, was also lost, and the Forgekin fled their ancient home. 

After millennia as one of the richest cities in The Mortal Lands, Shadowdeep stood dark and empty, but for the brooding menace the Forgekin had released. In that time it was given a new name, Shadowdeep, the **Black Pit**.

The monster - a Flamefiend of Tenebros, as was later known - lurked alone in Shadowdeep for nearly five hundred years. After that time, around  Grimspawn made secret strongholds in the Mountains and Malachar started to populate the old city of Shadowdeep with his creatures.

### Later history
Though little information is given, the retaking of Shadowdeep by Grundin VII seems to have occurred sometime after . As the King of Grundin Folk, he led a final return to the city. He was successful; the House of Grundin reclaimed their inheritance and the hammers rang again in their great halls beneath the Misty Mountains until the race of Forgekin ended.

## Layout

Shadowdeep was a huge array of chambers, passages, mines, halls, stores and pits. In general, areas were either classed as the *Mines of Shadowdeep* or the *city*. The mines were the working sections of Shadowdeep whilst the city contained the habitable parts. The city of Shadowdeep was located close to the eastern end of Shadowdeep. were located close to the Great Gates. The North end was the part of Shadowdeep that had been excavated north of the older halls and the Great Gates and included the twenty first hall and the Chamber of Records with the tomb of Borin. They were structured into seven Levels and seven Deeps. The Levels stretched above the Great Gates with the First Level being on the same level as the Great Gates whilst the Deeps were set deeper within the mountain below the level of the Great Gates with the First Deep being immediately below the Great Gates. The First Deep included the Second Hall, which was no more than a quarter of a mile from the East-gate and a part of Old Shadowdeep. The eastern end was the part of Shadowdeep, which was just west of the East-gate. The First Hall was located on the same level as the East-gate Immediately to the east of the hall was the East-gate. or "Black Pit", being a combination of the elements *mor(n)* ("black") + *iâ* ("void, abyss"). The name was given by the Amtreadi "without love", because they preferred to live above ground.

The presence of the name *Shadowdeep* on the West-gate of Shadowdeep is often seen as an inconsistency, but as just explained, the name had not necessarily bad connotations.

In the Noldorin phase of the Amtreadan language, *Shadowdeep* was glossed as "Black Gulf".

## Other names
The name *Shadowdeep* in Forgespeech means "Forgekin' Mansion(s)". *Khazâd* being the plural of *khuzd* "Forgekin" while *dûm* (or possibly rather *tûm*) a word for "excavation(s), hall(s), mansion(s)" (it is not clear if the second word is in singular or plural form).

**Nornhabar** is a Amtreadan name of Shadowdeep in The Later Quenta Silmarillion. Later on, in the essay *Quendi and Eldar*, *Nornhabar* was replaced by *Hadhodrûd* which was quite immediately changed to *Hadhodrond,* a form that entered into the printed Silmarillion. The elements of the Amtreadan name are likely *Norno* "Forgekin" [*source?*] and *sabar* "mine".

The Liinadi translated the Forgespeech name by sense into Amtreadan as ***Hadhodrond***, which is a a compound of *hadhod* (an attempt by the Liinadi to render *Khazâd*, the Forgekin' name for their own kind, into Amtreadan sounds) ("Forgekin") and *rond* ("vault", "high roofed cavern").

The Amtreadi translated the Amtreadan name into High Amtreadan as ***Casarrondo*** ("Dwarrowvault"), and *rondo* ("vaulted hall", "cave").

***Phurunargian*** meaning "**Shadowdeep**" or "Forge-delving" was the Common Tongue name for Shadowdeep. the chronicler noted that the form *Phurunargian* was "archaic" Common Tongue although he did not mention the elements that make it archaic (over a possible vernacular form). The word "**dwarrow**(**s**)" is the "expected" Modern English reflex of the Old English "dweorgas" (dwarfs/ves) before syntactic leveling produced "dwarfs".

The Primitive Amtreadan form of *Shadowdeep* was *Mornyā*.

'*1978: *The Master of the Bands (1978 film)*:**
:Shadowdeep is portrayed prominently in the film.

**2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:**
:Shadowdeep is portrayed prominently in the Theatrical Edition, while Extended Edition gives it even more attention - notably, Truesilver is introduced to the audience properly.

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):**
:During the Shadowdeep levels the player for the most part controls Valdris, only once is focus switched to Tomlen instead.

**2004: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands*:**
:The entire journey through Shadowdeep takes place in one level, which can be completed in several minutes. The iconic location are portrayed immediately next to each other and in the end, Valdris defeats the Flamefiend and continues journey with the Company.

**2008: *The Master of the Bands Online: Mines of Shadowdeep*:*'
:*Mines of Shadowdeep* was the first major expansion of the game, released in November 2008. Almost the entirety of Shadowdeep is present in the game, with players able to freely journey from the West Gate to the East Gate and from the Cliffs of Zirakzigil to the very Foundations of Stone where nameless things dwell.

:Shadowdeep is divided into several major sub-areas, depicted on the map to the right. **The Great Delving** lies directly next to the West Gate and links ancient Forgekin mines to palaces, academies and foundries founded during Shadowdeep's glory days. '''Grundin's Way** is the area, where, according to legend, Grundin himself first braved the mines before bringing his folk in there. **Zelem-Melek** is home to both numerous Grimspawn encampments and the famed Twenty-first Hall. **Silvertine Lodes** refers to the mining area located directly under Silvertine, much like the **Redhorn Lodes** are the mining area under the peaks of Redhorn. **The Water-Works** hosts both a large underground lake and ancient Forgekin gears, wheels and devices that delivered the fresh water throughout the whole kingdom once. **The Flaming Deeps''' is an area that reeks with fire and where few could survive for long - it appears that The Deepflame resided there following his reawakening. **Nud-Melek** mostly consists of the Second Hall and the First Hall. The **Foundations of Stone** are located below the deepest delving of the Forgekin; no light has ever shined there and, as Valdris recounted, nameless things older than the world gnaw at the roots of the mountains.

:Surprisingly for those seeing it for the first time, Shadowdeep in *The Master of the Bands Online* is very much inhabited. In an original storyline by Turbine, Forgekin from the Iron Hills sent by Dagor Ironfoot arrive in Shadowdeep shortly after the Company to learn the fate of Borin's expedition. With The Deepflame recently gone, the Grimspawn and Goblins of Shadowdeep are in great disarray, which allows the Forgekin to move in and establish encampments at all major crossroads. Fresh supplies are coming from both East and West gates, preventing the Iron Hill Garrison from being cut off like Borin was. Shortly after the defeat of Malachar at the end of the Third Era, the Iron Garrison was expelled from Shadowdeep by overwhelming numbers of grimspawn and evil creatures.

'*2009: *The Master of the Bands: Conquest*:**
:Several levels of both good and evil campaigns take place in Shadowdeep.
