Location Description: An ancient fungal cave network beneath the Dro'adi city of Vrasillex, known for its massive fungal growths and temporal disturbances. Key zones include the Threshold, Warden's Glade, Whispering Forest, Breathing Caves, Time Pools, Bone Garden, and Spiral Stone Grove.

## Overview

An ancient fungal cave network that extends far beneath the Dro'adi city of Vrasillex. The Deep Mycelium is older than the Dro'adi themselves, and time behaves strangely within its depths.

## Description

The caves are dominated by massive fungal growths that predate any known civilization. The air is thick with spores, and the deeper one travels, the more pronounced the temporal disturbances become. The fungi here "remember what has not yet happened."

## Zones

1. **Threshold**: Where maintained tunnels give way to wild growth; marked by warning stones carved with "Beyond here, the cycle bends"
2. **Warden's Glade**: First open area; grass-like fungi sway without wind; location of temporal echoes
3. **Whispering Forest**: Massive mushroom stalks with house-sized caps forming a canopy; bioluminescent spores drift like snow; Hook Horror territory
4. **Breathing Caves**: Where the walls pulse rhythmically
5. **Time Pools**: Vast cavern with four temporal basins
6. **Bone Garden**: Area littered with ancient remains
7. **Spiral Stone Grove**: Cathedral-like cavern where crystalline spiral stones grow; the impact site of the coming catastrophe

## Temporal Properties

The deeper regions experience increasingly severe temporal disturbances, including:

- Reversed echoes (hearing sounds before events occur)
- Copper-tasting temporal spores
- Green crystal fragments embedded in rock (effects from an explosion that hasn't happened yet)

## Campaign Appearances

### Heroes for Hire

**Session 9**: The party descended through the Threshold and Whispering Forest, encountered temporal echoes in the Warden's Glade, evaded Hook Horrors, and reached the Time Pools.
