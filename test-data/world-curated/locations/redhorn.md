# Redhorn

**Redhorn**, also called the **Redhorn** and **Barazinbar**, was one of the mightiest peaks in the Misty Mountains. A pass crossed over it and it was the most southerly point at which the Misty Mountains could be crossed.

## Description
Redhorn was one of the Mountains of Shadowdeep, the three mountains under which the great Forgekin city of Shadowdeep was built. It was also the only site in The Mortal Lands where truesilver could be mined. But mining ever deeper into the roots of the mountain in search of truesilver, the Forgekin miners unwittingly awakened the Flamefiend of Shadowdeep.

Redhorn was called *the Cruel* by the Forgekin and had long had a bad reputation, for they thought that the mountain was sentient, and purposefully drove off and killed travelers.

In the Quest of the Band, the Company attempted to cross the Redhorn Pass, lying beneath the slopes of Redhorn, but were met with harsh weather and falling rocks, prompting them to turn back. Thorngar attributed this to Redhorn itself, calling upon a malevolent force to stop them out of an apparent dislike of Forgekin and Amtreadi. Valdris however suspected that Malachar's power was at work. In Forgespeech, it is known as *Barazinbar*, from *baraz* ("red") and *-inbar* ("horn"). 

## In adaptations
### In *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's  film, the Company is trying to cross Redhorn in a blizzard, Morvain utters enchantments in High Amtreadan from the top of The Black Tower in Ironspire to prevent them from crossing the mountain by causing massive boulders to plummet down from the mountain and lightning to strike the mountain, sending a mass of snow cascading down and burying the Company. This differs from the book, in which it is suggested that an ancient evil born from the mountain itself was sending the foul weather to hinder the group's passage; or that it could have been the work of Malachar, from afar. Valdris himself responds to Thorngar's questioning of Malachar's reach, to which Valdris says, "It has grown long."

## In popular culture
