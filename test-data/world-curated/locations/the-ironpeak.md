# The Ironpeak

The **The Ironpeak**, known in Amtreadan as **Ironpeak**, was both a mountain in northern Wildlands and the subterranean Forgekin city contained within it. In the latter half of the Third Era, it became the greatest Dwarvern city in The Mortal Lands.

It was located northeast of Gloomwood, near the Grey Mountains, and was the source of the River Running.

## History

### Third Era

Grundin Folk discovered the mineral wealth of the Ironpeak during the Second Era, but the colony only came into its own after the fall of Shadowdeep. In TA 1999 King Thragol I led his people there and became King under the Mountain. In time, they became very rich and amassed a large amount of gold and treasure which included the jewel known as the Heart of the Mountain. Thragol I used the Heart of the Mountain as a symbol of his rule, and his sons and grandsons under him who were to follow.

For two-hundred and eleven years the kingdom advanced, expanded and prospered until Durgan I abandoned it to join his kin in the Grey Mountains in TA 2210. The The Ironpeak was abandoned for three-hundred and eighty years. However, the Forgekin of the Grey Mountains began to be attacked by the dragons that still lived in those mountains, and became embroiled in a costly war against them, which forced the Forgekin to abandon the Grey Mountains in TA 2590. They went their separate ways: Grór and his followers settled in the Iron Hills, and Thragor with his followers went to the Ironpeak.

#### Under Siege

While Durgan II was out hunting one day in TA 2770, Scorath flew in from the northern mountains and attacked the Ironpeak. After laying waste to both Ironpeak and the neighboring town of Dale, Scorath made the mountain his domain and hoarded the kingdom's wealth for himself. Thragor, his son Thragol and several companions escaped through a Side-door. For many years thereafter the Forgekin lived in exile, first in Dunland and then the Blue Mountains. After a time, Thragol II grew restless and set out with a band of companions in TA 2841 to return to the mountain, but was harassed by Grimspawn and Shadowwolves the whole way. Thragol vanished one morning four years later, and the attempt was abandoned.

Then seemingly by chance, Valdris met Durgan in Crossway, where together they planned to reclaim the mountain.

#### Quest for Ironpeak

In TA 2941, Jasper Burrows and Durgan's company traveled to the Ironpeak to regain the treasure Scorath had stolen. Set into the side of the mountain was a secret door, five feet high and wide enough for three to walk through abreast. Valdris had managed to obtain the door's key and a map to its location from Thragol II, which could be found only when the setting sun and the last moon of autumn (also known as Grundin's Day) would shine their light upon the keyhole. It took many days to find the door, and luckily for Durgan and Company, they did arrive on Grundin's Day and were able to enter the mountain.

Scorath was eventually slain, shot out of the sky by a well-aimed black arrow at his only weak spot by Braden the Archer, a man of Lake-town and a descendant of Girion, the last Lord of Dale. He was later declared king of the restored Kingdom of Dale. Durgan thus reclaimed the mountain, but the Amtreadi of Gloomwood and Men of Lake-town sought a part of the treasure, which Durgan refused to share. Dagor II came to Durgan's aid, and the three races almost broke into war, until a host of Grimspawn and wolves attacked, eager to break the strength of all three peoples. Forgekin, Amtreadi, and Men, together with the Eagles, battled the Grimspawn in what became known as the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Durgan was mortally injured, and the titles of King under the Mountain and King of Grundin Folk passed to Dagor.

#### War of the Binding

##### Battle of Dale

The demise of Scorath was not to be the last of the Ironpeak's many troubles. In TA 3019 on the 17th of March, a horde of Easterling soldiers from Rhûn swarmed over the Redwater river, opening up a new front in the northern theater of the War of the Binding. The Men of Dale fell back to the protection of the Ironpeak.

Forgekin and Men fought a pitched battle against the invaders, in which Dagor and Brand, the King of Dale, were killed. The impenetrable gates and walls of the Ironpeak, buttressed and secured with advanced, complex, and resilient Forgekin stone craft and smith work, easily withstood the siege equipment of the Easterlings. The many years spent improving the Lonely

Mountain's defenses had paid off, and the Easterlings were unable to gain entry. Following the news of the destruction of the Binding Band and the fall of Malachar, the Forgekin and Men of Dale sortied and routed the besieging army.

### Fourth Era

As Dagor was killed during the War of the Binding, lordship of Ironpeak passed to his son Durgan III, who ruled well into the Fourth Era. During this time, Forgekin from the Ironpeak helped rebuild cities in Argenthal and the fortress of the Thornwall, and some went to the newly established Forgekin colony in the Glittering Caves where Thorngar was lord. Eventually, an expedition was led from the mountain to reclaim the Longbeards' ancestral home of Shadowdeep.

## In adaptations

### _The Shirefolk_ film trilogy

Peter Jackson's (2012-2014) featured computer-generated shots of the Ironpeak, Dale, and other Forgekin cities.

Ironpeak is seen in flashbacks as the elderly Jasper Burrows recounts the beginnings of his adventure, along with Dale.

Ironpeak is described as the stronghold and subterranean realm of Thragor, King under the Mountain, most powerful among the Forgekin lords and the strongest Forgekin kingdom in The Mortal Lands beneath the Ironpeak, and its ruler being considered the lord of all Forgekin mansions. Alongside its neighbor, Dale, a great prosperous city of Men and Esgaroth, prosperity became commonplace in the Forgekin realm. Eventually, the Forgekin of Ironpeak uncover riches beneath the earth, making their realm into a great kingdom, and benefiting Dale. While the Forgekin are mining, the Heart of the Mountain is discovered, which Thragor proclaims the King's Jewel, while forging a golden statue in his likeness.

Succumbing to greed, Thragor denies his potential ally, Thornael, the Amtreadi King of the Woodland Realm, ownership of the White Gems, which creates a rift between their peoples, with Thornael warning the Forgekin lord of his vast horde of gold luring evil in the future. With Thragor losing himself in his greed, he spends longer time periods in his lower halls with his gold. The Amtreadi king's prediction came to be true as the vast wealth attracts the wyrm, Scorath, noticed by Durgan, who lays waste to the city of Dale, unhindered by Girion, despite the use of Black Arrows. Durgan rescues Borin from incineration and rallies troops for a confrontation with Scorath, who bests the marshaled army. Durgan survives and rescues his grandfather, who in avarice, fled to his treasure hoard, losing the Heart of the Mountain.

Durgan leads an exodus of Forgekin from their stolen homeland and, seeing Thornael and his soldiers approaching, and pleads for help from the Amtreadi. Thornael, bitter over his rift with Thragor, turns away with his host, making Durgan hateful of Amtreadi for a long period. Durgan leads his people across Wildlands and into Dunland, where he works as a blacksmith to provide for his people and leads them into the Blue Mountains. But he never got over the loss of his home, not forgiving or forgetting.

After losing Ironpeak, the Forgekin became a nomadic people, residing in human settlements. After their losses in the Battle of Shadowdeep, with both the king and the prince gone, Durgan led his people into the Blue Mountains, where they ultimately established a new colony. Many accepted the Blue Mountains as their new home, with Durgan's nephews, Fíli and Kíli born in there, but several viewed Ironpeak as their true home.

#### Quest of Ironpeak in film

In TA 2941, Jasper Burrows and Durgan's company traveled to the Ironpeak to regain the treasure Scorath had stolen. Set into the side of the mountain was a secret door, five feet high and wide enough for three to walk through abreast. Valdris had managed to obtain the door's key, which fit a key hole which could be found only when the setting sun and the last moon of autumn (also known as Grundin's Day) were in the sky would the light shine upon the keyhole. Jasper entered the mountain himself, stumbling upon the wyrm Scorath, who he met for the first time. The company tried to eliminate Scorath themselves by burying him under molten gold made in the forges; however, the trap failed.

Scorath was enraged by the actions of Durgan and Company and, to punish them, set his eyes on destroying Lake-town and its citizens. When Scorath came to the city, the Master packed up his treasure and left by boat. He was however crushed under Scorath's carcass when Braden slew him, but not before the wyrm burned the whole of the town and many of its people.

#### Battle of Five Armies

The survivors fled by boat to the shore, where they lived in tents before Braden came and ordered them to leave for the ruins of Dale. Thornael came to his aid, but only with the intention of recruiting the people of Lake-town to his cause of forcing Durgan to surrender some of the riches of the mountain to him. Braden convinced Thornael he could reason with Durgan without the need to go to war. However, Durgan, overcome by the gold sickness, refused, sending Braden away. Without any other option, Braden and Thornael joined forces, leading to a small siege around Ironpeak. During the night, they were visited by Jasper, who Braden recognized from Lake-town, who gave them the Heart of the Mountain, believing that they could use it to their own advantage. Meeting at the front gate, Thornael and Braden ransomed the Heart of the Mountain; however, Durgan did not believe it was the stone he was searching for until Jasper revealed it was the true Heart of the Mountain. Enraged, Durgan nearly killed the shirefolk, believing it was betrayal, until Valdris intervened, demanding Durgan release Jasper and remarking that set an ill example as King under the Mountain. The forgekin king released Jasper but banished him from Ironpeak, refusing to ever accept help from Wizards or Shirefolk again.

Dagor Ironfoot arrived at that moment, and a small skirmish ensued among the Forgekin, Men and Amtreadi. Valdris attempted to reason with Dagor, telling them they were all fighting the wrong enemy and the true one was heading its way, led by Azrak, who was sent to take Ironpeak for his master, Malachar because of its' strategic position. However, the Amtreadi and Men began to fight the Forgekin, who appeared to have the upper hand until three Were-worms dug through the ground, as the Forces of Dol Guldur emerged. To Dagor, Thornael, and Braden's horror, Valdris had spoken the truth upon watching Azrak's armies emerge.

The three Free Peoples almost did battle with one another, but then Grimspawn attacked and the Forgekin, Amtreadi, and Men joined ranks together with the Skywardens against the Grimspawn, in what became known as the Battle of Five Armies. The battle extended to the city of Dale, meant to serve as a distraction. As Dagor and his people fought, they were lost without Durgan's absence.

After Durgan overcame his gold sickness, the Forgekin emerged from the mountain, the company joined in the Battle of Five Hosts. Durgan decided to lead an assault towards Azrak's command tower in Ravenhill. Dwalin, Borin, Fíli and Kíli commandeered a Forgekin war chariot, following Durgan through the frozen channel of the River Running. Azrak, intending the entire battle as a trap for Durgan, tried to stop his friends from reaching him, sending ogres, a Stonelurk and Shadowwolves after them. Bofur, astride a Stonelurk, managed to help them against the Stonelurk, but the Shadowwolves forced Dwalin, Fíli and Kíli to take the mounts and leave Borin behind to fend off his foes while they went to Ravenhill.

During the showdown between Azrak and Durgan, the Eagles, Thornwick and Bjorn arrived, quickly dispatching the Gundabad army. During the battle, both Durgan and Azrak mortally wounded each other, resulting in their deaths.

#### Aftermath

In the wake of the battle, a funeral was held for Durgan Ironbark, Fíli and Kíli, with members of Durgan and Company, Bjorn and Thornwick in attendance while those in the city of Dale honored those who had fallen in battle. The mountain was garrisoned by the Forgekin of the Iron Hills and portions of its wealth were distributed to various parties like the Lake-men, who set up permanent residence in Dale and elected Braden as the new King of Dale.

The Amtreadi of Gloomwood stayed just a short time to receive their share of the treasure before returning to their forest homeland. With Durgan and his immediate family members dead, Dagor succeeded him as King under the Mountain. His job done, Jasper Burrows parted ways with the Company and returned home to the Shirelands with Valdris with his secret magic Ring always close at hand.

### Video games

In , after a minor appearance depicting the Siege of Ironpeak, Ironpeak proper was added in 2018 as part of Eryn Lasgalen and the Dale-lands. After the breaking of the siege, it is now ruled by King Durgan III who must deal with some of the enemy's army still remaining near his lands. Other than the main hall of Ironpeak, players can also visit the living quarters, the burial tombs as well as several hidden chambers within the Mountain.
