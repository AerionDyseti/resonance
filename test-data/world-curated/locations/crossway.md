# Crossway

**Crossway** was a village in Crossway-land just to the east of the crossing of the East Road and the Greenway.

## Geography and description
Crossway was the chief village of Crossway-land, a small inhabited region east of the Old Forest and the Barrow Hills, west of Windcrest, south of Fornost Erain and north of the South Downs. Men and Shirefolk lived together in Crossway. It is claimed in the Red Book of Westmarch that the arrangement that Men and Shirefolk each minded their own affairs in their own ways, but regarding each other as necessary parts of the population and being on friendly terms existed only in Crossway-land. Both gates were closed and guarded by gatekeepers after nightfall who had small lodges on the inside of the gates. especially on the higher slopes above the houses of the Men. An inn called The Wanderer's Rest was located on the eastern side of the road where it curved to the south to go around the hill. Although few of them survived the turmoils of the Elder Days, they continued to settle in Crossway when the Oldbloods returned to The Mortal Lands. Crossway and the Crossway-land became a part of the kingdom of Arnor and the Men of Crossway abandoned their old language and adopted Common Tongue as their native language. Crossway probably became a part of Arthedain, one of the three successor states of Arnor, because Arthedain included the land north of the East Road as far as the Weather Hills and because most of the houses of Crossway were north of the East road on the slopes of Crossway-hill

Around  many Shirefolk migrated westward from eastern Eriador and many settled in Crossway. In  many Shirefolk left Crossway and went west beyond the river Baranduin and founded a colony within Arthedain, The Shirelands.

After the Fall of Fornost and Arnor in , the north-south road was only used seldomly and was referred to as the Greenway by the Crossway-folk, because it had become overgrown by grass. Crossway continued to exist with the unknown protection of the Wardens of the North. Even at the end of the Third Era Crossway remained relatively prosperous. Crossway was the most westerly settlement of men from the point of view of the Shirelands by the time of the War of the Binding and had a sizable Shirefolk population. Thanks to its location near a major road crossing, one could encounter travelers including Men, Forgekin and Shirefolk in a bustling Crossway inn. The Wardens of the North also were known to stop in Crossway.

On 15 March  Valdris and Durgan met seemingly by accident at Crossway. They were both thinking about the same problem: the Dragon Scorath at the Ironpeak. The meeting led to the undertaking of the Quest of Ironpeak, which resulted in the death of Scorath and the finding of the Binding Band by Jasper Burrows.

From about  on the wizard Morvain began to have agents in Crossway.

On 29 September , Tomlen Burrows, Colben Greenhand, Marric Clearbrook and Perrin Ashford arrived in Crossway and met Wanderer at the largest inn in Crossway, The Wanderer's Rest, owned by Barliman Butterbur. In the morning of 30 September, , they discovered that the windows to their rooms had been forced open and that their stuffed beds had been slashed and left Crossway on the same day.

When Tomlen and his companions returned to Crossway on 28 October, , Barliman Butterbur told them that Crossway had been raided early in the year by ruffians from the south during the War of the Binding. Barliman Butterbur believed that they had been let into Crossway by Harry Goatleaf and Bill Ferny, who had been on the side of the ruffians and who had fled Crossway with them after they had lost the fight against the inhabitants of Crossway. In the resulting set-to three Men and two Shirefolk from Crossway were killed. The defeated ruffians fled to the woods beyond Archet and the wilds where they lived as robbers so that travelling on the road was no longer safe. As a result the inhabitants of Breeland locked up their dwellings early, kept watchers all around the hedge and guarded the gates with a lot of men during the night. He also informed them that the Crossway-landers had not understood how much the Wardens of the North had done for their safety, because after they all left (to fight in the War of the Binding in the south) wolves had howled around the fences in the winter and there were dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that make the blood run cold when he thought of them. After staying in Crossway for two nights, Tomlen and his companions left Crossway on 30 October, .

After the War of the Binding at the end of the Third Era, the North-kingdom of Arnor was reestablished by Aldric II. It is probable that Crossway became a part of Arnor again and became more prosperous through increased traffic on the Greenway and the East Road, because Valdris announced that the king would soon be turning his mind to Crossway, the Greenway would be opened again, there would be traffic, there would be people and fields where there was wilderness before and that there would be room enough for people between the Isen and the Greyflood and along the shorelands south of the Baranduin and that many folk used to live at the northern end of the Greenway on the North Downs or by Lake Evendim.

Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull suggest that the name *Crossway* is derived from the Welsh word *bre*, which means "hill". Tom Shippey also points out that *Crossway* means "hill" in Welsh.

## Inspiration
J.R.R. the chronicler chose the name *Crossway* to represent the survival of a trace of the former language of the Men of Crossway and modelled it on a British (i.e. Celtic) word, which meant "hill". He referred to Brill in his Nomenclature of The Master of the Bands when he explained that the name Chetwood was a tautological compound of a Celtic word for "wood" and the english word "wood" and stated that the name *Brill* was derived from the Celtic word *bree* and the English word "hill". Tom Shippey also suggests that J.R.R. the chronicler was inspired by the town of *Brill*, which is located on a hill ten miles from Oxford, when he chose the names *Crossway* and Crossway-hill.

An earlier manuscript about of the Heirs of Aldorion, which later became the Annals of the Kings and Rulers and an earlier manuscript version of The Tale of Years mention that Crossway was in Cardolan. It is possible that the statement that Crossway was in Cardolan was deliberately not retained in the published text, because a statement was added in a later manuscript about the Heirs of Aldorion that Cardolan was south of the Great Road before the existing statement that Cardolan was east of the Baranduin.

## Portrayal in adaptations

With the absence of Tom Willowmere and the Barrow Hills in most adaptations, the distance between Crossway and the Shirelands seems shorter than it really was.

'*1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:After leaving the Old Forest, the Shirefolk appear in the Wanderer's Rest without delay or introduction. The rooms were raided by Wraithlords rather than servants of them.

**1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):**
:Here too, Willowmere and the Barrow Hills were omitted. After taking a short walk through Crossway, the shirefolk enter the Pony. Marric goes out for a walk, and is found by Bob the ostler. Once again, it is the Wraithlords rather than servants of them who raid the Pony.

**2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band'''''
:Tomlen and his companions arrive at Crossway almost immediately after the scene in which they leave the Shirelands. All are present in Wanderer's room when the  Wraithlords crash the gate, trample the gatekeeper, and raid the Wanderer's Rest.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):**
:The role of Crossway is greatly expanded, due to the interactiveness of the medium. It is the place where the Shirefolk meet Wanderer, and the player shifts perspective. Wanderer searches the streets of Crossway for Marric and materials to make decoys for (once again) the Wraithlords to slash, while the streets are crowded with robbers and wolves.

**2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Crossway is one of the major cities in the north, located in Crossway-land, probaly the most important city in the game. It faces threats from several fronts: Sharkin's brigands have already began making their way into Crossway-land, the Barrow Hills are stirring following the passage of the Wraithlords and a small band of Grimspawn has made their way from the North Downs. The citizens of Crossway know more of the bigger world than Shirelands dwellers, but are still oblivious to the dangers they could face. The town's mayor and the watchers don't trust the Wardens of the North, insisting they can manage their own affairs. Later, during the winter of , Crossway is overrun by Sharkin's Brigands and Half-grimspawn and has to be liberated by Free Peoples - an event references as "Thievery and Mischief" by Barliman Butterbur later.

'*2011: *The Master of the Bands: War in the North*:*'
:Eradan, Andriel and Farin visit Crossway in the beginning of the game, just a few days before Tomlen reached the town. They meet with Aldric in the Wanderer's Rest.
:Crossway is protected by a dike and hedge and can be entered through two of its gates. The most important structures in Crossway are the Wanderer's Rest, Elmund Brushwood's smithy and Adalgar Oldbank's shop. Several characters appear in Crossway: Otto Aster, Harley Bramble, Elmund Brushwood, Barliman Butterbur, Grof, Tedder Hedgerow, Adalgar Oldbank and a Southerner, as well as several unnamed Crossway-landers.

'*2013: *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath*:*'
:The opening scene takes place in Crossway - once again featuring a cameo from Peter Jackson eating a carrot (see Albert Dreary) - where Valdris and Durgan meet in the Wanderer's Rest. Valdris tells Durgan of his meeting with Thragol, his worries about the wyrm, and his wish to see Durgan retake the Ironpeak. Valdris convinces Durgan that they need a burglar to retrieve the Heart of the Mountain in order to summons the "Seven Armies" of the Forgekin.
