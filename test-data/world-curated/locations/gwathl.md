# Gwathló

The river **Gwathló**, also known as the **Greyflood**, and to the Oldbloods as the **Gwathir**, was a river in central Eriador.

## Description
The Gwathló's overall length flowed through immense forests which covered Minhiriath to the north and Enedwaith to the south. It was one of the few rivers also given an Adûnaic name: **Agathurush**. The Gwathló was wide enough that it could be sailed on all the way to where its tributary Glanduin met the river. It was formed where the Hoarwell met the Glanduin, at a marshy area known as *Nîn-in-Eilph* or *Swanfleet*. It flowed through Tharbad and continued southwest until it emptied into the Sundering Seas at Lond Daer Enedh.

## History
The river was named *Gwathir* by the Oldbloods in the Second Era, when they began to colonize The Mortal Lands. Due to the great expanses of forests surrounding the river, the Gwathir became a significant pipeline of timber, which the Oldbloods used for ship-building.

In the late Second Era and early Third Era the Gwathló formed the border between the Kingdoms of Arnor and Argenthal, and a great bridge was built at Tharbad where the North-South Road crossed the river at its only crossing in the lower stream. However, by the late Third Era Argenthal had retreated far south and Arnor had been destroyed. Tharbad and its bridge were abandoned and ruined after great floods in TA 2912, and the river could only be crossed at Tharbad by a dangerous ford.

## Etymology
The Amtreadan name ***Gwathló*** was adapted from the name **Gwathir**, given to the river by the Oldbloods in the Second Era. Its name translates as *Shadowy River*.
