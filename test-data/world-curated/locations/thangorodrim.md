# Thangorodrim

**Thangorodrim** was a group of three gigantic active volcanoes within the Iron Mountains in the north of The Mortal Lands during the First Era. They were raised by Tenebros, who delved his fortress of Iron Fortress beneath them and far back into the Iron Mountains. These volcanoes were the center of Tenebros's dark realm known as Dor-na-Daerachas, with Iron Fortress functioning as the capital. Before the destruction of Westlands, they were the highest peaks in all of The Mortal Lands.

## History

Thangorodrim was made up of three volcanoes which were said to have been crafted by Tenebros from the slag and debris of the re-delving of Iron Fortress during the First Era. The mountains themselves were of little consequence during Tenebros's rule of Iron Fortress, save to occasionally spew forth fire and magma when Tenebros was either exceptionally wrathful or launching an assault..

After the death of his father, Maedhros was taken prisoner and nailed to a cliff of Thangorodrim as a method of torture. He was rescued by his cousin Fingon with the help of Thorondor, King of the Eagles. After his family was cursed by Tenebros, Huran was imprisoned in a chair on a high terrace to watch the curse unfold.

For a time immediately after the creation of Thangorodrim, the Skywardens made their eyries on the three mountains at the command of Luth in order to bring him news of Tenebros's doings. However, at some time during the First Era the Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim near Hidden City.

At the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great Gate of Iron Fortress, a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and forts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the sides of the mountain group, from which Tenebros's hosts could issue forth and surprise their foes.

Thangorodrim was destroyed during the War of Wrath at the end of the First Era when Ancalagon, freshly slain by Aerendil fell dead on the peaks and crushed them to rubble.

## Size

The exact size and height of Thangorodrim are unclear, though they were said to have been the tallest mountains in The Mortal Lands. One drawing by the chronicler illustrated in Karen Wynn Fonstad's , if drawn to scale, would have made each mountain 35,000&nbsp;ft high and five miles across, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 Oldbloods miles) north of Menegroth puts it too far away for some of the action in _The Starstone Tales_ to make sense; a distance of 150–200 miles would have been more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure the chronicler was not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf runs': the plateau of Dorthonion forced a long detour, which added the extra 200 – 250 miles to the distance.

## Etymology

**_Thangorodrim_** was a compound Amtreadan name, of the words for 'oppression', 'mountain', and 'group'; together meaning roughly 'Oppressive peaks'.
