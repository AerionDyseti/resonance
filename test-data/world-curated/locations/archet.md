# Archet

**Archet** was a village in Crossway-land. It was located northeast of Crossway, edge of the Chetwood. even many inhabitants from Archet were crowded on the road in Crossway to watch their departure. On that day Aldric and the Shirefolk left the East Road and turned to the north in the direction of Archet and on the next day turned right before they reached Archet to pass it on the east through the Chetwood. Barliman Butterbur told them that Crossway had been raided early in the year by ruffians from the south during the War of the Binding. Barliman Butterbur believed that they had been let into Crossway by Harry Goatleaf and Bill Ferny, which had been on the side of the ruffians and which had fled Crossway with them after they had lost the fight against the inhabitants of Crossway, but three Men and two Shirefolk from Crossway were killed. The defeated ruffians fled to the woods beyond Archet and the wilds where they lived as robbers so that travelling on the road was no longer safe. As a result the inhabitants of Breeland locked up their dwellings early, kept watchers all around the hedge and guarded the gates with a lot of men during the night. He also informed them that the Crossway-landers had not understood how much the Wardens of the North had done for their safety, because after they all left (to fight in the War of the Binding in the south) wolves had howled around the fences in the winter and there were dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that make the blood run cold when he thought of them.

## Etymology
- Archet* is an "English place-name of Celtic origin.

The name *Archet* has been modelled on a relic of a "British" (i.e. Celtic) name that was chosen for its meaning, because the survival of traces of the older language of the Crossway-men resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England. The element *chet* means "wood". J.R.R. the chronicler stated that the name *Archet* was descended from British **ar(e)cait-* and that Welsh *argoed* means "trees" or "edge of forest".

Mark T. Hooker suggests that the element *Ar-* is a prefix meaning "nearby", found in several Welsh place-names. The meaning of *Archet* would thus be "near the woods", which Hooker notes describes its geographic position "*on the edge of the Chetwood*".

David Salo suggests that *Archet* means "by the wood" and that it is equivalent to Welsh *Argoed*.

The real-life Welsh place-name *Argoed* means "by a wood".

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Archet is the settlement players start at if they are Shirefolk or of the Race of Man. During the Introduction of the *Shadows of Angmar* it comes under attack by Blackwold brigands who burn many of the homes to the ground. The settlement is commanded by Captain Brackenbrook, a retired sell-sword, but command passes on to his son, Jon Brackenbrook, when his father is killed in the attack.
