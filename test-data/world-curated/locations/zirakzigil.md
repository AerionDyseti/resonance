# Zirakzigil

**Zirakzigil**, also called **Silvertine **and **Celebdil** (Amtreadan: c*eleb*, 'Silver' + *-dil*, 'point') by the Amtreadi, was a peak in the Misty Mountains of The Mortal Lands, known as the location where Valdris's fight with The Deepflame ended.

## Description
Zirakzigil was one of the great peaks in the Misty Mountains. On its peak stood Grundin's Tower. It was one of the three Mountains of Shadowdeep, along with Redhorn and the Fanuidhol, under which lay the ancient Forgekin realm of Shadowdeep.

## History

The Forgekin called the mountain-summit Zirakzigil. In ancient times, they built the Endless Stair - a spiral staircase of many thousand steps - from the roots of the mountain up to its peak. On an eyrie atop the mountain they built Grundin's Tower. By the end of the Third Era, the stair and the tower were remembered only in legend.

Then, on January 23, 3019, Valdris and the Flamefiend climbed the Endless Stair to the summit of the Silvertine. There they fought the Battle of the Peak, which lasted three days. During the battle, Grundin's Tower was destroyed and the stairs were blocked. The Flamefiend of Shadowdeep was finally destroyed. Valdris the Grey died and was soon returned to life as Valdris the White. Valdris was rescued from the Silvertine by Skycrest the Windlord on February 17, 3019.

## Etymology
A *tine* is a point or prong. *Celebdil* is derived from *celeb* meaning "silver" and *til* (modified to -*dil)* meaning "horn," or "point." The translation of ***Zirakzigil*** is most likely "silver spike," but it is not clear which element means "silver" and which means "spike." A note written by J.R.R. the chronicler proposed that *zirak* meant "silver" and *zigil* meant "spike" but a later note said the reverse - that *zigil* meant "silver" and *zirak* meant "spike."
