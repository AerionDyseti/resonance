# Dor-lómin

**Dor-lómin** was a region of Hithlum in the First Era.

## Description

Dor-lómin was a country in the south-western part of Hithlum, bordered in the east by the Mountains of Mithrim, and in the north by the river which formed the Rainbow Cleft, known as Annon-in-Gelydh, or the "Gate of the Amtreadi". It was the birthplace of Turan, son of Huran and Morwen. There was also a mountain pass in its south, unknown to the Shadow.

Huran's house was built in its south-western corner near the mountain known as Amon Darthir, where the river Nen Lalaith began. but in FA 416 Fingalor gave it to Hador. Dor-lómin became a fief of the Third House of the Edain, which flourished there, strengthened by refugees of the First House from Dorthonion, until the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Tenebros then gave Dor-lómin, together with the rest of Hithlum, to his Easterlings, who absorbed or enslaved the surviving Edain. Tuor son of Huor was fostered by the Amtreadi of Androth in the Mountains of Mithrim.

Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the army of Dor-lómin was between 12,000 and 15,000. The entire host was destroyed during the battle.

After Turan fled south over the Ered Wethrin, bands of Easterlings came and attacked and enslaved the peoples of Dor-lómin, save Morwen, her daughter Niënor, and her servants, including Sador Labadal. The outlaws were led by Brodda, who wedded Aerin so that when he was dead, he would have an heir to keep the land under his family's rule. Over a year after Turan came to Greyvale, Morwen and Niënor went seeking Turan in Menegroth. Later, Turan came to seek Morwen in Dor-lómin, but they had already gone south over the mountains. Like the rest of Hithlum it was destroyed during the War of Wrath.
