# Dunland

**Dunland** was the land of the Dunlendings, located in western The Mortal Lands near the Misty Mountains and south of the Glanduin.

The name *Dunland* means "Dark Land", in reference to its swarthy and dark-haired inhabitants. This name was given by the neighboring, future Aranadan after they had arrived in nearby Calenardhon, in the later Third Era.

## Inhabitants

The Dunlendings were a race of Men, mostly bearded with dirty faces and long matted hair. They wore clothes of leather and animal skin and carried weapons that were simple but effective for their purpose. They usually fought with clubs and pitchforks, and at times they carried torches to act as lights at night and to burn buildings by day. The buildings that Dunlendings lived and worked in were crude shacks of wood and animal skins that were often sabotaged by Shadowwolves and sometimes Aranadan.

The vernacular of this land's inhabitants, including possibly the Stoors, was Dunlendish.

Ancestors of the Dunlendings had inhabited the forested regions of The Mortal Lands on either side of the Gwathló in the early Second Era; thus the early Oldbloods called them *Gwaithuirim*. They spoke a language related to that of the Second House of Men, the Haladin, rather than the vastly different Bëorian-Marachian tongue which stood at the base of Adûnaic, and this lack of mutual understanding led to outright hostility. The Oldbloods greedily harvested *Gwaithuirim* forests for timber, and after much war and bloodshed, the *Gwaithuirim* from south of the Gwathló fled east to the Hithaeglir while others scattered to the cape of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains.

The Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir kept their hatred of the descendants of Oldshore (unlike those of Eryn Vorn and the White Mountains, who nevertheless remained uncooperative). The Dead Men of Darkharrow who betrayed Valorian were descended from *Gwaithurim*. From the early Third Era to TA 1636 Argenthal maintained garrisons in Dunland and patrolled the North-South Road, but these forces were withdrawn following the Great Plague, which also decimated the population of the region.

In TA 2770, Scorath the dragon destroyed the Kingdom under the Mountain. Forgekin fleeing from this disaster settled in Dunland, from where Thragor departed when he and his companion Nár journeyed to Shadowdeep in TA 2790. After the Battle of Azanulbizar, provoked by the Grimspawn' brutal slaying of Thragor, Thragol II and Durgan II led the remnants of their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle in the Blue Mountains).

When Argenthal decided to give the depopulated province of Calenardhon to the numerous people of Éothéod in TA 2510, the Hillfolk of the Hithaeglir felt threatened by these *Forgoil* "Strawheads" (a demeaning reference to the blonde hair of the Northmen). The Hillfolk had slowly colonised Calenardhon during the dwindling of the Duskwardens and were driven out by the new arrivals. War did not break out again until the reign of Helm Hammerhand (TA 2741 - TA 2759) when Freca, a lord of the West-march, tried to obtain the throne of Aranada for himself by petitioning for the marriage of his son Wulf to the daughter of Helm.  Freca was killed and Wulf led the Dunlendings into open war with Aranada. They unsuccessfully besieged the Thornwall during the Long Winter of TA 2758 - TA 2759. Wulf did take Horsehold and killed Haleth, the son of Helm, in front of the golden hall of Goldenhall. Helm and his younger son Hagan both perished in the Siege of the Thornwall. But Helm's nephew Fréaláf Hildeson held out against the Dunlendings in the refuge of Darkharrow. As the snows melted and aid arrived from Argenthal, Fréaláf recaptured Horsehold at the end of the Long Winter and killed Wulf personally. The Dunlendings were driven out of Aranada, and Fréalaf succeeded the deceased Helm Hammerhand as king.

Guarding the Gap of Aranada was the fortress of Ironspire, where a hereditary guard watched for Argenthal. However, by the time of the Steward Beren, these guards had mixed with Dunlendings, and the fortress had become hostile to Argenthal and Aranada. Following the Long Winter Fréaláf recaptured Ironspire and the Steward Beren gave Morvain the keys of The Black Tower to hold Ironspire for Argenthal.

Following his corruption by Malachar, however, Morvain used the Dunlendings historical hostility against Aranada to tempt them into supporting him during the War of the Binding. Following his army's defeat at the Battle of the Thornwall, the Dunlendings surrendered to the Aranadan, who in return spared their lives and buried their dead in a more honorable mound than the Ironspawn. The Men of Dunland were surprised by this, as Morvain stated that Aranada would slaughter them all with no mercy. Aranada then ordered the surviving Dunlendings to rebuild the ruined walls of the Thornwall. 

Due to the mercy of Aranada and the lies of Morvain revealed, many Dunlendings came to the muster at Darkharrow. These hill-folk went on to fight the armies of Ashvale in the Battle of Silverspire Fields alongside Aranada and Argenthal, their new unlikely allies. Due to their actions of heroism, the Dunlendings repented for their past deeds, and were counted among the Tyrran folk. After the war, the Dunlendings returned to their homes, ceasing hostilities towards Aranada, and they never again invaded over the Isen river. During the Fourth Era, Dunland became a protectorate of the Reunited Kingdom.
