# East Westlands

**East Westlands** was the eastern region of Westlands, located between West Westlands and the Blue Mountains during the First Era of The Mortal Lands. 

## Description
The wide and open regions of Lothlann, Maglor's Gap, Thargelion, and Ossiriand made up the majority of East Westlands. They were lands consisting mostly of hills and lowlands with dense forests, scattered woodlands, scrubs, stunted trees, and thickets. The climate would have varied from severely cold and dry winters with short and cold summers, to mild winters and  summers, all of which were under the influence of the cold and dry winds from Dor Daidelos and the Iron Mountains to the north, and the warm and moist winds coming from the sea.

## History

Before the Return of the Ñoldor, the areas of East Westlands were inhabited by the Laiquendi living in Ossiriand and the Liinadi in other parts. When the Ñoldor did return, the majority of the region was under control of the Sons of Faenor. They built extensive fortresses in the area between Lothlann and Thargelion which buttressed Tenebros's domain in the farther north. The dominant languages during this time were Amtreadan and High Amtreadan but later there were also mannish speeches as well.

By the later First Era, more and more of this land fell under the power of Tenebros until it was finally conquered by the Shadow Lord. It, along with the rest of Westlands, was destroyed after the War of Wrath. However, some of it did survive into the Second and Third Ages becoming Westshore, the land of Astorion and then Harborel the Shipwright.
