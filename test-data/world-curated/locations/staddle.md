# Staddle

**Staddle** was a village in Crossway-land. It was located on the gentler south-eastern slopes of Crossway-hill. Staddle was the main settlement of the Crossway-shirefolk.

## History
On 29 September , there were some shirefolk of the the Underhill Family from Staddle in *The Wanderer's Rest* in Crossway. That night Tomlen Burrows, Colben Greenhand, Marric Clearbrook and Perrin Ashford arrived at the inn and Tomlen introduced himself as "Mr. Underhill" to Barliman Butterbur, the innkeeper. When Barliman introduced "Mr. Underhill" to the other guests in the common-room, he attracted their interest.

Tomlen and his companions left with Wanderer the next morning and most of the inhabitants from Staddle were crowded on the road in Crossway to watch their departure. Having walked for some miles on the East Road, Aldric and the Shirefolk could see later the houses and shire-holes north of the East Road on the south-eastern slopes of Crossway-hill.

## Etymology
The name *Staddle* is a dialectical English name, which is derived from Old English *stathol* (*staðol*), which means "foundation" (of buildings, sheds, ricks, etc.) and occurs in real-life English place-names.

## Portrayal in adaptations

:Staddle is located directly east of Crossway-town and is populated almost exclusively by shirefolk.
