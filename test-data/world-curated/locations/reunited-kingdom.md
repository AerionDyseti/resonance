# Reunited Kingdom

The **Reunited Kingdom** (also called the **Two Kingdoms**) was the restored kingdom of Arnor and Argenthal, which were the Realms in Exile founded at the end of the Second Era by Aldorion and his sons Valorian and Anareth. In the beginning, Aldorion was High King of both realms, but the two were divided after the deaths of his sons. Over 3,000 years later Aldric II reunited the kingdoms and ruled as High King of the Reunited Kingdom.

The fate of the kingdoms, especially that of Argenthal, would come to dominate the history of the Third Era.

## Geography
During Aldric's reign, the Reunited Kingdom expanded to retake all territories that had originally belonged to both Arnor and Argenthal at their greatest extents, excluding only Aranada (the grant of which he renewed), the Shirelands, and the Drúadan Forest, which governed themselves while being under the protection of the High King.

The Reunited Kingdom included all the lands of Arnor; all of Eriador, except the regions beyond the Lune and the lands east of Greyflood and Loudwater, in which lay Galel Anastrael and Eregion.

In Argenthal, the realm extended:

-  North to the Mouths of Treewater and the southern eaves of Gloomwood
-  West to the Greyflood
-  East to the inland Sea of Rhûn
-  South to the River Harnen, and also along the coast to the peninsula and haven of Umbar

Allied states of the Reunited Kingdom included Aranada, (possibly) Ashvale (when it was under the rule of the Men of Nurn), Dale, Ironpeak, the Glittering Caves (under Thorngar's rule there, and possibly his sucessors), East Goldwood, Beorning territory, the Shirelands, the Treegarth of Ornthac (Treewarden territory), Druadan Forest (home of the Wild Men, who were given autonomy by Aldric) and the Woodland Realm

## History
### Background
At the end of the Second Era, Aldorion and his sons established two great kingdoms in The Mortal Lands: Arnor in the north and Argenthal in the south. These Kingdoms of the Duskwardens were united under a single High King, Aldorion himself, who ruled the North-kingdom while his sons reigned jointly over the South-kingdom.

In the first years of the Third Era, this union failed. After the loss of Valorian at the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, his nephew Meneldil took up the kingship of Argenthal, and that country remained independent from the North-kingdom through most of the Third Era.

### Dissolutions
In the north, the realm of Arnor fell into troubled times. It broke into three separate kingdoms, and in time these too were lost, so that the Duskwardens of the North-kingdom of Aldorion were reduced to a wandering people led by a Chieftain. Nonetheless, they were able to maintain Valorian's line in unbroken descent. He rebuilt Annúminas and when he went north, would rule from there. the Shirelands was an exception to this, and though it lay within the Reunited Kingdom, Aldric made a law that Men should not enter it without permission , a law that he observed himself.

After Aldric's death in FO 120, his son Eldarion took up the high kingship. a dark cult emerged in Argenthal, but was overthrown soon after it was discovered.

It was foretold that after Eldarion's kingship ended, the Reunited Kingdom would last for at least "a hundred generations" before a new age began and Eldarion's descendants would be kings of many realms in days long after. While it is untold whether or not this prophecy was true, Argenthal, Arnor, and the chronicles of the House of Telcontar eventually became lost to time.
