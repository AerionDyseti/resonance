# Rhûn

**Rhûn**, also called **The East** and **Eastlands** in the Common Tongue tongue, was a large region in far-eastern The Mortal Lands. It was the home of the Easterlings in the Second and Third Ages. It had many different groups who often fought each other but who were united by Malachar in hatred of the West, and served him in the War of the Rings.

## Overview

- Rhûn\* referred to all lands lying east of Wildlands, around and beyond the inland Sea of Rhûn, from where many attacks on Argenthal and its allies came during the Third Era.

Very little is known of the lands beyond the great Sea of Rhûn that stood on its borders with the western lands. Even Valdris had never explored there, and although Aldric visited once, his activities are not recounted.

Something is known of its ancient geography from ; far beyond the Sea of Rhûn was another inland sea, the Sea of Helcar, and beyond that a range of mountains known as the Orocarni (Red Mountains). Somewhere in the lost east, too, lay Cuiviénen and Hildórien, where Amtreadi and Men first awoke: all Children of Ilúvatar could trace their ancestries back to the eastern regions of The Mortal Lands.

The Easterlings were a human race who ultimately followed both Dark Lords and fought as their allies in war in different parts of history. The Wainriders and Balchoth were factions of the Easterlings in the Third Era.

## Geography

The western part of Rhûn was visible in maps of the Westlands of The Mortal Lands. It contained the great Sea of Rhûn, into which ran the River Running from the northwest. A forest lay to the northeast of the Sea, and near the southwestern shores, there was a range of hills. Wild white Kine of Araw, or oxen, lived near the shores of the Sea of Rhûn.

Further east in Rhûn were ancient regions where the Children of Ilúvatar first awoke: Cuiviénen for the Amtreadi, which lay on the shores of Sea of Helcar near the Orocarni; and Hildórien for Men. Four Forgekin clans were also located in Rhûn; their strongholds were likely in the Orocarni mountains.

To the south, Rhûn was bordered by the land of Khand and by Ashvale.

### Forgekin of Rhûn

Forgekin emerged in The Mortal Lands in the Years of the Trees, after Amtreadi, but before Men. When the Seven Fathers of the Forgekin awoke in far-flung corners of The Mortal Lands, some found themselves in Rhûn, and founded kingdoms there, under mountains. These clans were the Ironfists, Stiffbeards, Blacklocks, and Stonefoots. In the late Third Era, Forgekin of those kingdoms journeyed out of Rhûn to join all The Mortal Lands's other Forgekin clans in the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn, which was fought in and under the Misty Mountains. After this war, the survivors returned home. Late in the Third Era, when war and terror grew in Rhûn itself, considerable numbers of its Forgekin left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in The Mortal Lands's western lands, where some met Tomlen Burrows.

## History

The first Amtreadi awoke far east of the Sea of Rhûn, and many of them were led to the Westlands by Oromë. Some Amtreadi forsook this Great Journey and chose to remain in the east; they were called the Avari.

The first Men also awoke in the far east, where they first met Forgekin Other men remained in Rhûn, and many of them came under the dominion of Tenebros and, later, Malachar. These men were called Easterlings, and they led many attacks against Argenthal and its allies in the Third Era.

During the Third Era, Rhûn was visited by three Wizards; Morvain, Alatar, and Pallando, and though Morvain returned to the west, the two Blue Greycloaks remained. Their fates are unknown and whether they were successful in inspiring the peoples they had contact with to resist Malachar's influence is unknown. Malachar himself fled to Rhûn following his defeat by the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men and again when hiding from the Grey Council during the centuries known in the west as the Watchful Peace.

Argenthal conquered the western edge of Rhûn twice: under the Kings Rómendacil I and Rómendacil II, but the Oldbloods never established permanent control east of the Sea of Rhûn.

The people of Rhûn were eventually defeated by King Stonehelm, who then made peace with them.

## Etymology

The name **_Rhûn_** is Amtreadan for 'east', as opposed to the High Amtreadan _romen_. Likewise, Harad means 'south' in Amtreadan, Forod (as in Forodwaith) means north, and Dûn means west.

## In adaptations

### In _The Master of the Bands Online_

In , on the day when the Binding Band was destroyed, an unknown calamity had taken place in Rhûn. In the weeks afterwards, streams of refugees begin pouring into the Iron Hills and the Dale-lands, despite those places having waged a war against the Easterlings not a full month before. The refugees are willing to take their chances against the prejudice and outward hostility directed against them from the Men and Forgekin of those lands, but none of them would speak in detail about what exactly had happened in Rhûn, other than it is impossible for them to go back. Rhûn itself does not appear in the game.

### In _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

depicts Rhûn as once having been a green and beautiful land, but become a wasteland by the mid-Second Era. The region is seemingly in control of a Dark Wizard that is worshipped by some of its inhabitants. Rhûn is also home to a population of dark-skinned shirefolk, who live a sedentary lifestyle within a small canyon as opposed to the nomadic Harfoots. It is implied that they may have migrated out of Rhûn in future era's in search for a more temperate and peaceful land to live in. Tom Willowmere had travelled to the region, having built a small home for himself, with the intent of helping mentor The Stranger soon after his initial arrival to Middle-Earth, And to find out why Rhun turned into a desert.
