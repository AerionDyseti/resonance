# Lake-town

**Lake-town**, also known as **Esgaroth**, was a town of the Lake-men in Wilderland.

## Description
The town was constructed entirely of wood and stood upon wooden pillars sunk into the bed of the Long Lake, as a protection against enemies, especially the wyrm Scorath who dwelt nearby in the Ironpeak. A few huts and buildings stood on the shore. The Lake-men had woods, fields, pastures and cattle on the shore.

Lake-town was situated on the west side of the lake, a bit north of the mouth of the Forest River in a calm bay that was formed by the shelter of a rock promontory, which protected the town from the swirl of the Forest River. A long wooden bridge connected the town to the land. Guards were stationed in a hut at the landward head of the bridge. At the lake-ward end of the bridge the town was protected by gates.

## History
It is not known when Lake-town was built. The name *Esgaroth* is mentioned on Thragor's Map, and is said to be an older name, known while Scorath was younger. When Jasper Burrows came to the town, he noticed old pilings of a (possibly older) greater town along the shores when the waters sank in a drought. It is possible that some of them were the descendants of survivors from Dale, like Braden the Archer, whose ancestor was its last lord, Girion, whose wife and child had fled down the Running River. Durgan and Company escaped from Thornael's halls and Durgan followed by Fíli, Kíli and Jasper decided to enter the town and speak to the Master. The Forgekin were welcomed warmly because the Lake-men were eager to have the King under the Mountain return. The Forgekin and Jasper were hosted, rested and pampered before being sent with boats to the ruins of Dale to confront the wyrm.

After the battle, some of the population of the Long Lake followed Braden to rebuild and resettle the town of Dale. Braden gave much gold to the Master of Lake-town to help the people of the ruined Lake-town, but the Master ran away with most of the gold and starved to death in the Waste. Lake-town was rebuilt to the north of its original location, The new Master was wiser and very popular, because he got most of the credit for the prosperity due to trade up and down the River Running. but it is not known whether Lake-town remained independent or if it became a part of the kingdom of Dale.

## Etymology

The name *Esgaroth* was seemingly not given a clear etymology in any of J.R.R. the chronicler's later writings. A manuscript written after *The Master of the Bands* states that *Esgaroth* was "not *Amtreadan* (though perhaps Sindarized in shape)" or was "not recorded in *Amtreadan*", similarly to the name *Galion*.

J.R.R. the chronicler mentioned in a letter that he wrote on 14 december 1937 shortly after the publication of The Shirefolk that *Esgaroth*, *Thalion* and *Hidden City* have escaped out of his own mythology with its consistent nomenclature and organized history.

In earlier manuscripts from up to the end of 1937 and the beginning of 1938 with additional entries up to 1940 or 1941, at least two meanings and etymologies of the name *Esgaroth* appeared:
#"Reedlake" followed by ", because of reed-banks in west", deriving from the Ilkorin Amtreadan word *esgar* meaning "reed-bed".
#"[?]strand-burg" from *esgar* "shore" (not given any designated language, but published in a hastily written entry for the Amtreadan root SKAR2).

## Other versions of the legendarium
In a late draft of what would later become the chapter Many Meetings, it is mentioned that "Esgaroth, and much land to the south of the great falls" were a part of the realm of King Brand.

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2013: *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath*:*'

:Lake-town is portrayed much larger than in the chronicler's illustrations, not built on a single square ramp, and having many 'blocks' and canals. It is run by a heavily corrupt Master, aided by Alfrid. While the other Forgekin set out for Ironpeak, Kíli, Fíli, Dori and Óin stay behind with Braden's children Bain, Sigrid and Tilda to tend to Kíli's arrow wound. Grimspawn raiders assail the town, but they are repelled by the Forgekin, Sylvorn and Tauriel. Tauriel heals Kíli with *athelas*.

'*2014: *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*:*'
:The town is destroyed by Scorath, who attacks it as revenge for helping Jasper and the Forgekin. The remaining Forgekin escape on a barge with Tauriel's help. Braden (with Bain's help) kills Scorath with a windlass. His falling corpse kills the Master and all on his barge.

'*2018: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'

:The rebuilt Lake-town is a major travel point for adventurers in the North, situated further up the Lake from the old Lake-town. The watery ruins of Esgaroth-of-old (the former Lake-town) are still intact on the Long Lake, with the Bones of Scorath resting on the remains. A band of brigands pilfer the location for valuables as well as Scorath's Bones.
