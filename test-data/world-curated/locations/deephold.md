# Deephold

**Deephold** was the stronghold built by Finoran Felagund which delved into the banks of the river Narog in Westlands.

Deephold was the capital of the **realm of Deephold** between Nenning, Narog and Teiglin, including the surrounding hills of Taur-en-Faroth and the Talath Dirnen to the north, as well as Tumhalad. Finoran was the overlord of all the Amtreadi in the West Westlands, except the Falathrim.

## History

### Building

After the return of the Amtreadi to The Mortal Lands, Finoran and his brothers were established on north Westlands with Fingalor. In , he was visited in Tol Sirion by his cousin Turgon from Nevrast; both travelled together southward to Westlands. While resting in the Meres of Twilight, Vorel went to them and laid upon them a deep sleep and disturbing dreams. None told the other about his dreams, but both cousins began a search for hidden places in case Tenebros broke the Siege of Iron Fortress.

In , Finoran, who had now been a long guest of Thingol, marvelled at Menegroth and shared with Thingol his dreams and desire to make for himself a place in like manner. Thingol then told Finoran of caves under the High Faroth on west-bank of Narog, which few knew of, and provided him guides to lead him there. As Finoran came upon the Narog rushing down its steep course under the hills’ shadow, he resolved to make there a secret fortress and store-houses against evil days. In the far banks he saw the opening of many caves, and dwelling within were Petty-forgekin, the remnant of a once more numerous people who still lingered there and had in their language named this region _"Nulukkizdîn"_.

In this place Finoran carried out his designs in establishing great mansions, and in this labour he had at first help from the Petty-forgekin, for which he rewarded them generously.

In the Forgekin of the Blue Mountains resumed their trafficking into Westlands following their meeting and subsequent alliance with Finoran's cousin Caranthir. Finoran had further help from these Great Forgekin in extending his underground fortress, but these Great Forgekin despised the Petty-forgekin, and had no compunction in ousting them, especially for great reward. Mîm, the chieftain of the Petty-forgekin, thus developed a special hatred for the Amtreadi, and attempted to murder Finoran in his sleep; this failed though, and he was driven out into the wild.

Among the other developments of Deephold, Finoran also raised an artificial hill, Amon Ethir, a league far from its gates.

### Days of power

Finoran ruled Deephold until he joined Beren in his quest for the Starstone and handed rule to Orodreth. However, since the Battle of Sudden Flame Celegorm and Curufin, the sons of Faenor, were defeated and retreated to Deephold where they were received as one of them. Although the city grew stronger because of this, the influence of the sons of Feänor became higher. Celegorm and Curufin lived in Deephold at the time Finoran departed with Beren and were more powerful than Orodreth until Finoran's death was reported, at which time they were exiled.

### Fall

Turan Turambar later came to Deephold and became one of its chief fighters, but he also persuaded the people to fight openly against Tenebros (the bridge was built at this time), which eventually led to its sack by the army of the wyrm Glaurung.

### Legacy

Glaurung stayed there for about five more years guarding his stolen hoard until he went northeast to Brethil to assail Turan and was killed by him at Cabed-en-Aras. Then, Mîm the Petty-forgekin settled there reclaiming his people's ancient home until he was killed by Huran. Huran entered the dark caves where the treasures Finoran brought from The Blessed Realm still lay there, but he brought out the Nauglamir.

The realm remained deserted for the rest of the First Era until the War of Wrath when it went down with the rest of Westlands. Ages later, the realm will be remembered in Forgekin lore and mentioned by Aelindra.

## Etymology

From its first conception, the name **_Deephold_** means "Underground fortress on the river Narog". Its Petty-dwarvish name was **_Nulukkhizdîn_** (erronously spelled _Nulukkizdîn_ in the published works).

However, in his later life, the chronicler devised the Dwarvish name **_Nar(u)kathan_** instead, to which the Amtreadi suffixed _-rond_, "vaulted dome".

In Eriol's Old English translations, Deephold is referred as _Hlydingaburg_ "City of the Hlydingas" or _Stangaldor(burg)_.
