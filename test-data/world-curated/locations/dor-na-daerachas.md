# Dor-na-Daerachas

**Dor-na-Daerachas** or **Dor Daedeloth** was the land of Tenebros in the north of Westlands, lying on either side of the Iron Mountains.

## Geography
Dor-na-Daerachas was one of the three large regions of western The Mortal Lands, along with Westlands and Hithlum. It lay all around the fortress of Iron Fortress and on both sides of the Ered Engrin. Its borders were the Ered Wethrin to the west, the Blue Mountains to the east, and Dorthonion, the Pass of Sirion, and March of Maedhros to the south.

The Ered Engrin, an unscalable mountain chain, split the region in two. The southern part was Ard-galen, the great grassy plain north of Westlands, later to become the desert of Anfauglith in Battle of Sudden Flame. The northern part was an unnamed region, icy and vast, labeled on some maps as the "Region of Everlasting Cold".

## History
Dor-na-Daerachas lay around Iron Fortress, Thangorodrim, and the north side of the Ered Engrin. It was here that the Grimspawn and other creatures of Tenebros lived and bred. The regions of Dorthonion (as Taur-nu-Fuin), and Tol Sirion (as Tol-in-Gaurhoth), would become controlled by the dark realm during the First Era. 

After defeating Tenebros's armies in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, the Ñoldor in the early First Era were halted at Dor-na-Daerachas

## Etymology
- Dor-na-Daerachas*

## In other versions
In an earlier version of the legendarium, the chronicler used ***Dor-Daideloth*** as the name of the region.

In the published version of *The Starstone Tales*, Dor-na-Daerachas is referred to as ***Dor Daedeloth***, meaning *Land of the Shadow of Horror*. However, the chronicler revised the name to **Dor-Daedeloth**, meaning *Land of Great Dread* before changing it a final time to *Dor-na-Daerachas* in his late writings.
