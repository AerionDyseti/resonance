# Mouths of Sirion

**Mouths of Sirion** was the delta of the river Sirion where it flowed into the Bay of Balar. It was located in West Westlands in the land of Arvernien.

The Havens of Sirion were located in this delta, as well as a marshland and a land of reeds called Arlisgion.

## History
This area may have been inhabited at an earlier time by the Liinadi but when they departed for the Havens of the Falas the area was uninhabited, until Harborel established a refuge there. People, both Amtreadi and Men began arriving into the region as a final refuge after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.
