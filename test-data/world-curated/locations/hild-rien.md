# Hildórien

**Hildórien** or **Murmenalda** was the land in which mankind first awoke, in the first year of the Sun of the First Era. The region was in the far east of The Mortal Lands southeast of  the Orocarni and Cuiviénen, the awakening place of the Amtreadi. 

It is untold whether the region survived the tumults of the War of Wrath at the end of the First Era. 

## History

According to the Ambarkanta, before the War of the Powers Hildórien lay eastwards of the Mountains of the Wind. According to legends of the Edain, Tenebros visited Men in Hildórien and tricked them into believing their mortality was a punishment, in order to convert them away from Eru Ilúvatar. Mortality was however, a Gift of Ilúvatar bestowed upon them, not a punishment. To escape the evil of Tenebros and his followers, the Atanatári were the first to flee Hildórien, travelling west eventually to Westlands. However, the Men that continued to worship Tenebros followed later on in the First Era with the promise that if they served him, they would receive the rich lands of Westlands as payment.

With the War of Wrath the geography of The Mortal Lands was changed, it is not clear if Hildórien was submerged under the Eastern Sea or survived under another name, but it is not mentioned again.

## Etymology

***Hildórien*** is a High Amtreadan name for 'Land of the Followers'. *Hildor* (meaning 'followers') was a name given to Men by Amtreadi.
