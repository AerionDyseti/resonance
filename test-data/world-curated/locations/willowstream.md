# Willowstream

The **Willowstream** was the lesser tributary of the Clearbrook River that flowed through the Barrow Hills and the Old Forest and passed into Brookshire on the borders of the Shirelands. The Dingle, the valley of the Willowstream, was said to be the source of all the strange occurrences in the Old Forest. Tom Willowmere lived here in his house on top of a hill between the Barrow Hills and Old Forest.

## History
According to shirefolk folklore, Tom Willowmere met Silverbrook, the River-daughter, in a pool down the Willowstream. He later brought her to his home north of the river and every summer would gather water-lilies for her along the river side. He was on his last trip of the year when he met Tomlen Burrows and the rest of his company on September 26, 3018.

When Tomlen, Sam, Marric and Perrin were passing through the valley of the Willowstream, they encountered Old Man Willow, an ancient tree who showed bitter hatred to all other living creatures in The Mortal Lands people and trees alike. The Shirefolk were lulled to sleep under his spell all except Tomlen and Sam who regained consciousness in time to save Marric and Perrin who had been trapped inside the old willow's trunk. Tom Willowmere happened to be strolling along the river at the time and rescued them all by demanding that he let them go.

## Geography
The river was about three miles in length and began at a waterfall that probably cut into the cliff at the edge of the Barrow Hills near the house of Tom Willowmere.

At the mouth of the Willowstream there was a haven in the north bank called Grindwall. The Grindwall was not under the protection of the High Hay therefore it was guarded by a fence that was built extending into the water's shallows. There was a small village called Breredon on the other side of the Grindwall between the Clearbrook and the High Hay.

## Etymology
The word ***withy*** means'' 'willow** (common element in English place-names) and ***windle*** meaning **spindle** or **reel** and is supposed to be translated from Shirelands-speech.

## In adaptations

In , as Willowstream flows through the Old Forest, signs of long-abandoned habitation can be found along its shores.
