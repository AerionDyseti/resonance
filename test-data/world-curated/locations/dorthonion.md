# Dorthonion

**Dorthonion**, later **Taur-nu-Fuin** (also called **Taur-na-Foen** and **Deldúwath**), was a highland region of the First Era lying immediately to the north of Westlands, and south of the plains of Ard-galen (later Anfauglith) bordering Tenebros's stronghold of Thangorodrim.

## Description

Dorthonion was 60 leagues east to west. In the north, it rose gradually from the plains, with great pine forests. The Ered Ashplain formed the southern boundary of Dorthonion, bending to the north on the east side to create the Pass of Aglond between Dorthonion and Hill of Himring. To the south and west of Dorthonion were the Echoriad, which surrounded the hidden Kingdom of Hidden City. The upper reaches of the River Sirion passed between the western slopes of Dorthonion and the Ered Wethrin. In the center of Dorthonion was a mountain named Orod-na-Thôn.

## History
Dorthonion was originally ruled by Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin, but it was overrun by Tenebros in the Battle of Sudden Flame and absorbed into his dark realm, Dor-na-Daerachas. Dorthonion was known afterwards as Taur-nu-Fuin, which translates as *Forest under Night* or *The Forest under the Shadow of the Night*.

The northeastern slopes of Dorthonion were known as Ladros, a fief given to Valdric of the House of Bëor. Here Barahir and his faithful XII Bëorings dwelt until they were all slain at Tarn Aeluin by Grimspawn sent by Malachar, save for Beren, Barahir's son in FA 460. Beren dwelt alone in the wilderness of Dorthonion for a time until he left for Greyvale and met Luthiel.

Along with the other lands west of the Blue Mountains, Taur-nu-Fuin was mostly destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Era. Afterwards, its highest points survived as the island **Tol Fuin** (Isle of Night), part of the Western Isles.

## Etymology

- Dorthonion* was a Amtreadan name that meant 'land of pines'.

- Taur-na-Foen* is a Amtreadan name meaning "Forest of the Foen", another name for Orod-na-Thôn.
