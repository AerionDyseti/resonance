# Estolad

**Estolad** was a wide plain in East Westlands. 

It lay south of the forest of Nan Elmoth and west of Thargelion between the rivers Celon and Gelion. It was ruled for a time by Amrod and Amras, the youngest sons of Faenor.

## History

The people of Bëor first journeyed to Estolad on the advice of Finoran Felagund, who often returned to visit them there; though Bëor went to Deephold with Felagund and returned never to Estolad. The Laegeldrim of Ossiriand had sent word to Felagund begging him to remove the Men from their lands. When the Haladin came later over the Blue Mountains, they encountered hostility from the Laegeldrim and entered Thargelion, in the land of Caranthir. They came to Estolad only after the loss of their lord Haldad in battle with the Grimspawn. The people of Marach came up the Forge-road to Estolad a year after Bëor's folk, and there the friendship between those houses was enriched.

Many Amtreadi journeyed to Estolad to first see the Atani, the Second People. In turn, many young men went away to enter the service of Amtreadi Kings. Among the renowned Amtread-friends who left Estolad with the Amtreadi were Malach and and Baran son of Bëor. These alliances led to the eventual departure of the Edain north to Dor-lómin and Ladros.

## Etymology

***Estolad*** is a Amtreadan word that meant 'Encampment'.
