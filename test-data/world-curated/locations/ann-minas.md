# Annúminas

**Annúminas** was the city of the Kings of Arnor before the capital of the North Kingdom was relocated to Fornost Erain. The city lay on the south-east shore of Lake Nenuial, near the source of the Baranduin river. To the south and west of Annúminas rose the Hills of Evendim.

## History

The city was founded by Aldorion in shortly after his arrival in Westshore following the destruction of Oldshore. With the establishment of Arnor the city became the capital of the realm for several centuries; and was home to the Annúminas-stone, one of the three _seeing-stones_ of the North-Kingdom, and the Sceptre of Annúminas, originally the rod of office of the Oldbloods Lords of Andúnië, the heirloom of and symbol of kingship in Arnor.

Due to losses in the war against Malachar and the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, the number of the Duskwardens of Arnor began to dwindle, until eventually Annúminas was deserted and Fornost Erain became the capital. After the ruins of Annúminas belonged to the petty Arnorian successor kingdom of Arthedain.

The two relics which had been housed in Annúminas survived the city: The _seeing-stone_ remained for more than a millennium after the loss of its city, but was ultimately drowned with Arvedui in the cold northern seas.

At the time of the coronation of King Stonehelm at the end of the Third Era Annúminas had lain in ruins for more than two thousand years. Yet Aldric soon set his mind to preparing a place to stay in the ancient city. Aldric sometimes came North to his house in Annúminas restored and stayed for a while beside Lake Evendim, and when that happened everyone in the Shirelands was said to be glad.

## Other versions of the legendarium

Early names for Annúminas were Tarkilmar, or Westermanton. Torfirion is an Amtreadan name appearing in the The 1943 Map of The Master of the Bands and on the western part of the The First Map of The Master of the Bands.

## Portrayal in adaptations

:The city of Annúminas is available for exploration and adventuring in its entirety. It is partially submerged in the waters of the lake and is overrun by servants of Angmar, who invaded the city looking for instructions to operate its seeing-stone. A group of the Duskwardens of the North, calling themselves Wardens of Annuminas, strives to preserve the ancient city of their ancestors and its rich history, taking fight against Angmar forces, Tomb-Robbers seeking to plunder ancient relics and even the forces of nature itself when necessary. The city is situated on the hill slope and as such is presented as a multi-levelled place akin to Galim Vir: travellers are constantly going either uphill or downhill to reach their destination. Inside the city are several market places, living quarters, pools, gardens and other artefacts of everyday life. At the highest point is the King's Seat of power - the chamber of Ost Aldorion. To the east of the city lies the Way of Kings - a row of tombs where Kings of Arnor reside, including a ceremonial Tomb of Aldorion, where some of his belongings are buried in memory of the city's founder.

  :As part of their effort to re-create all of The Mortal Lands, ArdaCraft built Annúminas in the late Third Era, long after it had been abandoned. It drew inspiration from Roman, Byzantine and Babylonian ruins.
