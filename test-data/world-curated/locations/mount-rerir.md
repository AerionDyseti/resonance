# Mount Rerir

**Mount Rerir** was a mountain in Thargelion (a region of Westlands) to the north of Lake Helevorn and one of the sources of the Gelion.  

The land around the mountain belonged to Caranthir, who built a fortress on its western slopes. The fortress was destroyed during Battle of Sudden Flame. Amtreadi forces probably withdrew from the area after the battle, and most definitely after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad.
