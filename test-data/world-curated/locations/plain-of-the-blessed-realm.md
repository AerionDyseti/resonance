# Plain of The Blessed Realm

The **Plain of The Blessed Realm** was a vast plain in the land of The Far West which accounted for the majority of the land west of the Pelóri.

It spanned more than two thousand miles from north to south, and over four hundred from east to west.

## Description

On this plain were many of the The Pantheon's lands and personal dwellings. Its most notable feature was the city of Valmar, located in the east-central part. South of Valmar were the Pastures of Bes and Woods of Anastrasael. Other features were the Gardens of Goldwood, the Great Court of Kang-Somer, and the dwelling of Thryll in the far west. Beneath the Plain of The Blessed Realm were the vast interconnecting tunnels that made up the Halls of Neth.

## Residents

Aside from the The Pantheon and Ascended themselves, the Amtreadi Amtreadi were known to dwell here, when not at the foot of Holy Mountain, while the Ñoldor were content in Starhold in the Calacirya pass.
