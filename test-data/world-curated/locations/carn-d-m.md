# Carn Dûm

**Carn Dûm** was the chief fortress of the realm of Angmar and the seat of its king. It was located at the northwestern end of the Mountains of Angmar, the north-western extension of the Misty Mountains. The lord of the Wraithlords came north and established the evil realm of Angmar between the Ettenmoors and the Mountains of Angmar on both sides of the Misty Mountains, because he intended to destroy the Duskwardens of the North and to exploit the disunity of the splinter realms of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur. He gathered many evil men, Grimspawn and other fell creatures in Angmar and became known as the Specter King of Coldreach. It is not known if Carn Dûm already existed when the Specter King established the realm of Angmar or if it was built during his reign.

In  a large army from Angmar invaded and devastated Cardolan, but a remnant of the Duskwardens of Cardolan defended the Barrow Hills or fled to the Old Forest. The last prince of Cardolan was slain in that year and was said to have been buried in the barrow in the Barrow Hills in which Marric Clearbrook and Tomlen Burrows were trapped by a Barrow-wight almost 1700 years later.

In , the combined armies of Argenthal, Westshore and Arnor crossed the river Lune and defeated the forces of Angmar in a great battle on the plain between Lake Evendim and the North Downs. The Specter King of Coldreach fled northwards towards Angmar with a remnant of his forces, but but his forces were overtaken by the cavalry of Argenthal led by prince Eärnur and by forces led by the Amtread-lord Aurindel who came north from Galel Anastrael before they could reach the shelter of Carn Dûm. The Specter King was able to flee, but the remaining forces of Angmar were utterly defeated and no man or grimspawn of the realm of Angmar remained west of the Mountains. As a consequence, it is possible that Carn Dûm was destroyed. It is also possible that Carn Dûm was repopulated after , when Grimspawn began making secret strongholds in the Misty Mountains,. 

On September 28 of  while Marric Clearbrook was trapped with Tomlen Burrows by a Barrow-wight in a barrow in the Barrow Hills, he had a dream that he and others were attacked and defeated by the men of Carn Dûm at night and that his heart had been pierced with a spear. It is possible that he dreamt of the experiences of the last prince of Cardolan during the last hours of his life.

## Etymology

The etymology of *Carn Dûm* is uncertain, but it is often interpreted as a Amtreadan name.

In early manuscripts of *The Master of the Bands*, *Carndoom* and later *Caron-dûn* (both meaning "Red Valley") appear as early names of Dimrill Dale. Paul Strack favours these early terms as Noldorin precursors of Amtreadan *Carn Dûm*. David Salo also favours the Amtreadan interpretation, giving it as "Red Valley", a compound of *carn* + *tûm*. 

Another suggestion, is that the name roughly translates as "mountain fortress" in Gaelic; although the chronicler uses Celtic elements for some translated Mannish names, this would have been the only instance where he uses Gaelic. It is unknown whether this is just coincidence or not.
