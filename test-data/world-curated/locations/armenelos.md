**Armenelos**, also known as the **City of the Kings**, **Armenelos the Golden** or **Arminalêth**, was the capital city of Oldshore.

It was situated on a hill the Kingsland, close to the Meneltarma. a tower and a citadel that had been built by Elros,

The Amtreadi of Lonely Isle brought many gifts to Oldshore, one of which was a seedling of the White Tree Caelorn and it grew in the courts of the King in Armenelos and it was named Nimloth.

The Adûnaic name is *Arminalêth*,

## Other versions of the legendarium
At early stages of writing, the city was called by other names: **Númenos**, **Númar** or **Nûmar** (at first used of what became Oldshore). In later developments it was known as **Antirion** (the Golden). The city's Adûnaic name was **Ar-Minalêth** or **Arminalêth** which survived in later drafts of the *Akallabêth*. Additionally in *The Peoples of The Mortal Lands*, Christopher corrected a mistake he made in *Malachar Defeated* where he said the name Arminalêth was replaced by Armenelos, instead the Eldarin name Armenelos replaced the Eldarin name **Tar Kalimos**.
