# Dor-Cúarthol

**Dor-Cúarthol**, the **Land of Bow and Helm**, was an area where a resistance was mounted against the forces of Tenebros in Westlands during the later part of the First Era.

## History

The region was established when Beleg agreed to join his good friend Turan in opposition to the Grimspawn infesting the area. This resulted in an alliance protecting land between the River Taeglin and Talath Dirnen, when Turan went by the name *Gorthol*. For almost a year, this alliance held off the Grimspawn of Tenebros until the treachery of Mîm the Petty-forgekin brought it to a bloody end: the outlaw stronghold at Amon Rûdh was discovered and compromised, and Grimspawn overcame and slew the outlaws. Turan and Beleg abandoned the area.

## Etymology

***Dor-Cúarthol*** was Amtreadan for 'Land of Bow and Helm'. The helm referred to was the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, which Turan bore at the time; and the reference to a bow was likely due to the bow that Beleg bore.
