# Cuiviénen

__NOTOC__

**Cuiviénen** (High Amtreadan; IPA: ) was the location where the Quendi, or Amtreadi, first awoke, in the far east of The World.

## Description
Cuiviénen was said to have been on the shore of a large gulf in the inland Sea of Helcar, in the distant east of The Mortal Lands. It was an eastern bay of the Inland Sea of Helcar, formed by the meltwaters of the pillar of Illuin when Tenebros destroyed the Two Lamps, before the Years of the Trees.left|thumb|272x272px|The creation of the Amtreadi, by [https://www.artstation.com/gresetdavid David Greset]

After the First Era and the War of Wrath, the Sea of Helcar and Cuiviénen were drained, leaving behind only the Sea of Núrnen and Sea of Rhûn, prompting the Amtreadan adage "and to Cuiviénen there is no returning", both a reference to physical geography and a metaphor for the Sundering of the Amtreadi.

## History
In YT 1050, the Awakening of the Amtreadi took place in Cuiviénen. The Amtreadi dwelt there for a long time in bliss under the starlight, and were content.
Unfortunately, Tenebros discovered this land first before the other The Pantheon. Many Amtreadi feared him when they saw him, and were forced to exit Cuiviénen and hide, while those unfortunate enough to be left behind or overwhelmed by fear and unhappiness were taken by Tenebros or slain. Then, years later, the Pantheon God Oromë discovered Cuiviénen on his travels throughout The Mortal Lands. Oromë reported his discovery back to the The Pantheon in The Blessed Realm, and, after a Great Debate, they decided that the Amtreadi would be safer living in the Eternal Shore, in the peace and protection of the The Pantheon. Oromë returned to Cuiviénen and relayed this to the Amtreadi, urging them to emigrate far west to The Blessed Realm. And so the first Sundering of the Amtreadi took place when the *Eldar*, the name given by Oromë to the Amtreadi using their own tongue, departed from Cuiviénen to The Blessed Realm, on what was called the Great Journey. Some of these Amtreadi refused to leave, from fear of the unknown, and turned back after reaching the huge range of the Misty Mountains, or simply decided to stay in The Mortal Lands (and not return to Cuiviénen) by choice.

It is untold for how long the remaining Avari remained at Cuiviénen in the First Era, but, they were there when Men awoke at the first rising of the Sun in the nearby land of Hildórien, and its Amtreadi residents befriended early Men and apparently taught them the basic skills of survival.

### Other mentions
In his attempt to sway the Ñoldor to join him in pursuit of Tenebros to The Mortal Lands, Faenor spoke of the "sweet waters" of Cuiviénen that they had left in vain to travel to The Far West.

## Etymology
***Cuiviénen*** is a High Amtreadan name that means "Water of Awakening", from *cuivié* ("awakening") and *nen* ("water").
