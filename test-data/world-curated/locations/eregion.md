# Eregion

__NOTOC__

**Eregion**, later known as **Hollin**, was a realm of the Ñoldorin Amtreadi in the Second Era, located near the West-gate of Shadowdeep (later Shadowdeep). It was a rare Amtreadi kingdom, as its relations with Forgekin were cordial, and both sides traded freely with each other.

## History

### Second Era
Eregion was, from SA 750, ruled by Aelindra and Caelorn from its capital of Ost-in-Edhil. After SA 1350, they crossed the Misty Mountains to Goldwood, their new kingdom.

From SA 1350, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain under Celebranor, the last of the House of Faenor left in The Mortal Lands, ruled Eregion. Annavar, the Giver of Gifts, befriended Celebranor and aided him in the making of the Shadows and Seven Bands of Binding. Celebranor made the Three in secret, and as such these were never touched by Annavar's hands.

When Annavar was later revealed to be the Shadow Lord Malachar, Celebranor and his people tried to stop the Rings from entering Malachar's possession, but could only rescue the Three: Band of Air, Band of Fire, and Band of Water. Eregion itself was attacked and destroyed in the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar in the year SA 1697. The few survivors of the war found refuge in either Westshore or Goldwood, while others led by Thalion founded Galel Anastrael.

## Etymology
In Amtreadan, ***Eregion*** means "Land of the Holly", from the word *ereg* ("holly"). Men simply called it *Hollin*.

Eregion should not be pronounced as in English *region*: the *g* is the *g* in "get". The pronunciation is , or, simplified, [air-egg-eon].

## In adaptations
### *The Bands of Binding*
Eregion, mainly Ost-in-Edhil, is portrayed in Amazon Studios' series  as a developed Amtreadi city built near the west gate of Shadowdeep, as the home of Celebranor, Lord of Eregion, and his smiths.
