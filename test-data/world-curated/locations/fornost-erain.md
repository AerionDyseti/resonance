# Fornost Erain

**Fornost Erain** was the second capital of Arnor and later the capital of Arthedain. It was located at the south end of the North Downs, about 100 miles north of Crossway, at the northern end of the North-South Road.

## History
### Early history
It is possible that Fornost was founded around or after the establishment of the realm of Arnor in , because there is no record of the Oldbloods penetrating so far north before the Downfall of Oldshore. After the fall of Malachar in the War of the Final Alliance, around , the larger part of the Army of Arnor marched west on the North-South Road through the Fords of Iron and continued north to Fornost. The number of Duskwardens of Arnor had decreased because of the War of the Final Alliance and the Disaster of the Gladden Fields and the city of Annúminas turned into ruins. As a consequence the heirs of Valandil moved the capital of Arnor to Fornost.

In , when King Eärendur died, Arnor was divided into the kingdoms of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur, because of dissensions among his sons. As a consequence, Fornost became the capital of the new realm of Arthedain. In , when the Specter King of Coldreach took the tower of Windcrest, the *seeing-stone* that was located in the tower was saved and carried back to Fornost during the retreat. The new young King Araphor repelled the enemy from Fornost and the North Downs.

### Fall
In , the forces of the Specter King of Coldreach invaded Arthedain before the end of the winter and captured Fornost. King Arvedui first resisted on the North Downs until the last, then fled with some of his guard to Forgekin mines at the northern end of the Blue Mountains and drowned in the Icebay of Forochel with the two Seeing-Stones he had saved from the forces of Angmar in March of the following year

In , As a consequence, it is possible that Fornost was abandoned after the the defeat of the army of Angmar.

### Legacy
After Fornost Erain was abandoned, Men referred to it as '''Deadmen's Dike'* and feared to go there. but it is not known what they did there and how long they stayed there.

It is possible that Fornost was rebuilt and resettled after King Stonehelm reunited Argenthal and Arnor, as Valdris had announced that King Stonehelm would go there again one day and fair folk would be riding through Crossway and that many folk used to live at the end of the Greenway on the North Downs.

The Common Tongue names of *Fornost Erain* and *Fornost* were "Norbury of the Kings" respectively. Norbury is a modernised form of Old English *north-burg*, which means "north (fortified) town".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In an earlier manuscript version of *The Tale of Years of the Second Era* it is mentioned that the shards of Starshatter were brought to Valandil in Galel Anastrael, that he became King of Arnor and lived in Fornost.

In an earlier version of what would later become Appendix A it is mentioned that Annúminas became deserted due to the decrease of the people and that the city of the realm of Arthedain of the oldest son of Earendur was Fornost. An even earlier version contained a note that Valandil removed to Fornost and that Annuminas was deserted, but this was later struck out and Annuminas became deserted was added to the note for king Aerendil whose name was later changed to Earendur.

In an earlier manuscript version of *The Tale of Years of the Third Era* it is mentioned that Valandil became King of Arnor and lived in Annuminas in T.A. 10, that Amlaith of Fornost ruled the realm of Arthedain, Annuminas is deserted after the death of Earendur in T.A. 861 and the names of the kings at Fornost were no longer given in High-amtreadi form.

In an earlier version of the Prologue of *The Master of the Bands* and in an earlier manuscript version of *The Tale of Years of the Third Era* the Common Tongue name of Fornost was *Northworthy*.

Earlier names of Fornost are *Osforod, the Northburg*, or *Fornobel, the North Burg*. On the The First Map of The Master of the Bands (and on the subsequent 1943 map), Fornost is called *Fornobel*.
