The hills of **Stone Hills**, upon either side of Nen Hithoel, were a vast, seemingly impenetrable maze of crags situated in the region of Wildlands in The Mortal Lands.

The Stone Hills lay between the Eastemnet of Aranada and the relatively empty lands that contained the Bonefens and the Nindalf. It was approximately seventy-five miles from east to west and some one-hundred miles from north to south. The western boundary of Stone Hills and eastern border of Aranada were formed by the East Wall of Aranada, a great, natural rocky cliff running in a curve from north to south.

## History

In TA 3002, Éomund, father of Horsehelm and Shieldwyn, was slain while pursuing a band of Grimspawn near Stone Hills.

At the beginning of , Tomlen Burrows and Colben Greenhand, attempting to reach the Obsidian Gate of Ashvale, are lost in the eastern Stone Hills for days until Creepkin finds them. After a great deal of persuasion, he agrees to show them the way to the Gate, leading them south into the Bonefens.
