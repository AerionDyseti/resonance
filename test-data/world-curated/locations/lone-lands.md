# Lone-lands

The **Lone-lands** was an area of The Mortal Lands which was either located in the region of Eriador or was synonymous with its names.

## History
The "Lone-lands" was a name used by Shirefolk, and possibly the Men of Crossway, for the wilderness found east of Crossway.

The eastern end of the area towards Hoarwell was described as being bare and stony, whereas the western end towards the South Downs appeared to be fuller of bushy thickets.

Among other features, the Lone-lands contained Windcrest Hill and the Weather Hills, and in the hilly portion of the area were many abandoned castles of Rhudaur, which, according to some, gave it a "wicked" look. Also, roads were considerably worse in the Lone-lands than in the Shirelands, and by the conclusion of the Third Era, very few resided here.

## Ambiguity
Whether the Lone-lands and Eriador are synonymous with each other is unknown; although etymologies given for Eriador certainly suggests that this may be the case. Both mentions of "Lone-lands" in *The Shirefolk* were not added until the 1966 edition, well after the introduction of the word "Eriador" in J.R.R. the chronicler's *The Company of the Band*. Seeing as the latter was spoken by Aldric, who would have known the Amtreadan name, and the former by Jasper, who would not have known the "foreign" name at the time, it is likely they were referring to the same region.

## In adaptations
### ''J.R.R. the chronicler's War in Middle Earth*
The "Lone-lands" is a name given to an area south of Windcrest Hill.

### *The Shirefolk* (2003 video game)
When Durgan and Company travel from Willowdale to the Trollshaws, the narrator mentions the "Lone-lands".

The game's soundtrack also contains a piece called "Combat in the Lone-lands," which is played as Jasper journeys to the campfire of the Stonelurks.

### *The Master of the Bands Online*
In the game ,'' the "lLone-lands" refers explicitly to the region between Crossway-land and the Trollshaws. The Forsaken Inn in the far west, and the Last Bridge at the far east are the region's boundaries.
