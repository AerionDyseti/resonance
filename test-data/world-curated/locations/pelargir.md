# Pelargir

**Pelargir** was a great city on the river Greatwater, and the main harbour of Argenthal.

## History

Pelargir was built in as a haven of the Faithful. The King's Men established havens farther South. It had in its early days been a city only a few miles away from the coasts, but after the Downfall of Oldshore the coasts along the Bay of Belfalas had retreated a great distance and the city was left far inland. Pelargir was one of the cities that assembled Argenthal when it was founded in by the Faithful. Tarannon's nephew Eärnil I, who succeeded him, rebuilt Pelargir and built a great navy to conquer Umbar.

Castamir was highly loved in the shore regions of the land, and when he usurped the throne, he purposed to move the throne from Starbridge to Pelargir. Castamir's great-grandsons Angamaitë and Sangahyando eventually retook Pelargir in , and slew king Minardil. Aldric and the Ghosts Men of Darkharrow struck fear into the men of Umbar and drove them towards Pelargir; and on the next day, they met the Corsairs there,

## Etymology

- Pelargir* is Amtreadan for "Garth of Royal Ships". Christopher the chronicler has noted that the first element derives from the Amtreadan element/root *pel-* ("go round", "encircle"). Paul Strack suggests that it is a compound of *pêl* ("fenced field") + the prefix *ar(a)-* ("royal", "noble", "high") + lenited form of the plural *cîr* of *cair\* ("ship").

## Inspiration

Writing in a letter about an impending trip in 1955, the chronicler identified Pelargir as Venice.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*1980: *The Return of the King\* (1980 film):\*\*
:Pelargir appears on a map when Valdris explains the coming of the Black Ships.

\**2006: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands*:*'
:Pelargir is one of the settings in which skirmishes can be fought.

'*2014: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Pelargir was built around the meeting of the rivers Sirith and Greatwater, on the eastern border of the Lower Five Rivers area and the Central Argenthal region, west of Upper Five Rivers and Eastern Argenthal. Aldric's retaking of Pelargir was featured in an Epic Battle and served as the climax of Book 2 of Volume IV. The city's emblem was a blue anchor on a white background, with gold trim. The city was divided into the West-garth, the East-garth, the Market Ward, the Shipwrights' Ward, the Court of the Ship-Kings, and Tol Ciryarani, though the latter was rendered inaccessible by a collapsed bridge by the time Aldric liberated the city. Argillond, the Harbor of Royal Ships, was partitioned from the rest of the Greatwater by two sea-gates, one on the east and one on the west.

:Sirgon was Lord of the city during the War of the Binding, and was captured and spirited away by Haradrim slavers when the city was captured. Sirgon's son Faltharan and his captain Thandor took command of the city following its liberation. Faltharan managed to rescue his mother and siblings, only to soon discover his brother Lorvegil had betrayed the city to the Corsairs, allowing it to fall. After apprehending Lorvegil, Faltharan discovered and rescued their father at the beacon Sirthanc in Upper Five Rivers.

'*2022: *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*:*'
:After surviving the eruption of Doomfire Peak and escaping the newly-named Ashvale, Bronwyn informs Aelindra upon a hilltop that she was planning on leading the surviving Southlander remnant to Pelargir, which she refers to as "_an old Oldbloods colony_".
