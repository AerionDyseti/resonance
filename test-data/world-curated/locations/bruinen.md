# Bruinen

The River **Bruinen** ("**Loudwater**") was a river in the region of Eriador which fed into the Mitheithel.

## Description
The Bruinen began with two tributaries in the Misty Mountains, one of them at the High Pass where Goblin-town was later dug. The river formed the eastern border of the Kingdom of Arnor and later the petty-realm of Rhudaur, south of which was Eregion (Hollin).

The southern arm of the Bruinen flowed through the deep valley where Thalion founded the Amtreadi village of *Galel Anastrael* or Galel Anastrael. Thalion had some control over the river, as it would rise in anger if he had need to bar the way into Galel Anastrael. Indeed it can be assumed that Band of Air, the Band of Air, allowed Thalion to maintain such power over the valley.

The Bruinen had only one point where it could be passed, a Ford near Galel Anastrael. This Ford and by extension the river were called the *Edge of the Wild*.

## History
When Durgan Ironbark and Company ventured eastward to reclaim the Ironpeak (Ironpeak), they passed the Bruinen after their encounter with the Stonelurks, before they arrived at Galel Anastrael.

At the beginning of the War of the Binding, Tomlen Burrows was raced on Aurindel's horse, Starrunner, towards the Ford of Bruinen, with the Wraithlords in pursuit. At the Ford Tomlen made his stand, and defied the Specter King of Coldreach. This lured the Wraithlords into the Bruinen, and Thalion released a great flood, which took the form of horses made out of water. This flood killed the horses of the Wraithlords, buying the Company much time.

## In adaptations
In the first film of Peter Jackson's *The Master of the Bands *film trilogy, it is at the Fords of this river that Elowyn, bearing a wounded Tomlen on her horse, confronts the Shadows Wraithlords and eventually  summons the flood that consumes them. She does so by chanting to the river in the High Amtreadan tongue.
