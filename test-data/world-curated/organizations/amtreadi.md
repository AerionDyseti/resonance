# Amtreadi

The **Amtreadi** were the first and eldest Aenveladi, considered the fairest and wisest of the earthly race of The World. They called themselves the **Quendi** (High Amtreadan: "the Speakers"; singular **Quendë**), referring to how at their creation, they were the only living things they knew of that spoke. They were the third of the Free Peoples of the World.

Anastrasael referred to the Amtreadi that chose to follow him during the Great Journey as Eldar (Q.: _"People of the Stars"_), because when they awoke the stars were the only lights in the sky. Some, known afterwards as the Calaquendi (Amtreadi of the Light), were brought by the The Pantheon from The Mortal Lands to The Blessed Realm across the Sea, where they were taught by the Firstborn. But after the Starstones were stolen by Tenebros, some of the Amtreadi returned to The Mortal Lands, where they remained until the end of the Third Era.

Amtreadi were immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.

## History

### Creation & awakening

The Firstborn, the Elder Aenveladi, were conceived by The Primordial alone in the third theme of Ainulindalë. They are the eldest and noblest of the speaking races of The Mortal Lands. They awoke at Cuiviénen, the Brook of Awakening, in the far east of The Mortal Lands, in the starlight of the Long Night, as the Sun and Moon had yet to be created. The first Amtreadi to awake were three pairs: Imin ("First") and his wife Iminyë, Tata ("Second") and Tatië, and Enel ("Third") and Enelyë.

According to legend, Imin, Tata, and Enel, and their wives joined up and walked through the forests. They came across six, nine, and twelve pairs of Amtreadi, and each "patriarch" claimed the pairs as his folk in order. The now sixty Amtreadi dwelt by the rivers, and they invented poetry and music in The Mortal Lands. Journeying further, they come across a band of Amtreadi watching the stars, which Tata claimed as his. These were tall and dark-haired, the fathers of most of the Ñoldor. The ninety-six Amtreadi now invented many new words. Continuing their journey, they found twenty-four pairs of Amtreadi, singing without language, and Enel added them to his people. These were the ancestors of most of the Lindar or "singers", later called Liinadi. They found no more Amtreadi; Imin's people, the smallest group, were the ancestors of the Amtreadi. All in all they numbered 144. Because all Amtreadi had been found in groups of twelve, twelve became their base number and 144 their highest number (for a long time). None of the later Amtreadan languages had a common name for a greater number.

### Discovery & sundering

The Amtreadi were content and dwelt long under the stars in woods near Cuiviénen. However, Tenebros, the Shadow Lord, became aware of them and their location before the The Pantheon, and sent evil spirits to spy on and afflict them. Many spirits that harassed the Amtreadi came in the form of great horsemen for the purpose of causing the Amtreadi to fear the Pantheon God Anastrasael, whom Tenebros knew would likely be the first Pantheon God to discover them. And so it was that, on one of his many journeys in the wilds of The Mortal Lands, Anastrasael came upon the Amtreadi. Due to Tenebros's foresight and malice, some Amtreadi were afraid. Hiding and fleeing, some of these early Amtreadi were taken by Tenebros or his agents. These Amtreadi were never seen again and were taken to First Darkness, and were believed to be twisted and mutilated into the first Grimspawn. However, the Amtreadi who stayed quickly learned that Anastrasael was far different from the evils that had been pursuing them. Anastrasael quickly came to love the Amtreadi, and them and gave them the name _Eldar_ (People of the Stars).

Anastrasael spent some time with them and then returned to The Blessed Realm to tell Luth of his discovery. He then returned to live with Amtreadi for a time, learning about them. Not long after, the The Pantheon decided that, for the good of the Amtreadi, that Tenebros needed to be overthrown. The The Pantheon made war upon Tenebros and set a guard on Cuiviénen. The Amtreadi knew nothing of the war save that the earth shook and thunderous lightning was seen in the north. After a long, grievous war, the The Pantheon were triumphant, and Tenebros was imprisoned. Anastrasael then returned to the Amtreadi with a summons of the The Pantheon to The Far West. However, many of the Amtreadi were afraid, as they felt and had seen rumor of the terrible power of the The Pantheon as they made war against Tenebros. As such, the it was decided by the Amtreadi to choose ambassadors one from each kindred to go to The Blessed Realm and report back to their kindred what they saw. The names of these representatives were Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë.

They devised writing scripts and developed arts of building, metallurgy, and shipbuilding, and poetry and music became common and lasting practices of all Amtreadi kindreds. For three ages, the Amtreadi lived in total peace and bliss, wandering and enhancing the lands. After these three ages, Tenebros completed his sentence. He feigned rehabilitation, and convinced Luth that he was no longer a threat. However, his stay in prison had only increased his malice, and, remembering that it was for the sake of the Amtreadi that he had been overthrown, he sought to poison the peace of The Blessed Realm and bring ruin to the Amtreadi. Adopting a fair and wise form, he began to cultivate the trust of those living in The Blessed Realm. Of the three Amtreadi clans, Tenebros saw the Liinadi as rather useless to him, and the Amtreadi would have nothing to do with him, being content in their development. But the Ñoldor, desiring more knowledge than other clans, were willing to listen to him, and Tenebros saw that, due to their creative skill, they were more potentially useful than the Liinadi. And so Tenebros began to teach them, and for a long while none of his evil was made manifest, for any who sought his aid and counsel benefited greatly from it. But with his genuine teachings came half-truths and disguised lies regarding the intentions of the The Pantheon. Most harmful among these was the knowledge that Men, the Second Children of The Primordial, would one day appear in The Mortal Lands. The The Pantheon had not revealed this to the Amtreadi, and after a time, rumors began to circulate amongst the Ñoldor that the The Pantheon had brought them to The Far West so that Men might inherit The Mortal Lands and usurp the glory that might have belonged to the Amtreadi. Chief amongst these discontented Amtreadi was Faenor, the firstborn son of Finwë, King of the Ñoldor. Faenor was gifted beyond virtually all of his peers in terms of beauty, skill, subtlety, and craftsmanship. It was he who had developed, amongst many other wonders, the system of letters used by the Ñoldor. But his greatest creation had been the Starstones, three diamond-like gems in which the intermingled light of the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm had been captured.

However, despite Faenor's capabilities (or perhaps because of them), he was exceedingly arrogant, and his actions were often rashly conducted. He hated and feared Tenebros, but unwittingly provided his lies with their most prominent voice. Eventually, Tenebros's lies and Faenor's own vanity resulted in him drawing his sword against his half-brother Fingalor. Erstwhile the The Pantheon had been troubled by the unrest of the Ñoldor, but had simply watched and waited. Now however, with the peace of The Blessed Realm violated, they could no longer ignore the issue. Faenor was brought to Máhanaxar and told to explain himself. With this, the lies of Tenebros were at last laid bare, and he fled before the The Pantheon could recapture him. However, for his actions, Faenor was banished from Starhold for a time.
Twelve years later, Luth sought to heal the wounds between the Ñoldor at a festival held in Valmar, but Tenebros and the Great Spider The Webmother destroyed the Two Trees, darkening The Blessed Realm, killing Finwë, stealing the three Starstones of Faenor, and fleeing to The Mortal Lands.

### Revolt of the Ñoldor

When the tragic death of his father became known, the wrath of Faenor could no longer be contained. He gathered all the Ñoldor in Starhold and beneath the Mindon Eldaliéva he urged the Ñoldor to return to The Mortal Lands in pursuit of Tenebros and the Starstones swearing an oath to war with Tenebros, now known as Tenebros. After being banned by the The Pantheon for the rebellion and the violent deeds of the House of Faenor, the Ñoldor returned to The Mortal Lands as exiles to battle Tenebros, and to establish and rule realms of their own. and then through Tuor and Idril. This union would create a bond that would enrich and ennoble both kindreds from then to later ages.

The terrible Oath of Faenor created strife between the Amtreadi kindreds, as even those not bound were drawn into it over the Starstone recovered by Beren and Luthiel. The two brothers Celegorm and Curufin attempted to usurp the throne of Deephold after the loss of Finoran in the Quest for the Starstone, but were thwarted by the hound Huan and Orodreth and expelled. It was because of this deed that the Ñoldor of Deephold lent little aid to the Union of Maedhros during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Twice in the latter half of the First Era, the Sons tried to take the Starstone from those who inherited it. These acts of cruelty and violence against their Amtreadi kin caused great loss of life and resulted in the deaths of all of them except Maglor, who forever wanders the coasts of The Mortal Lands singing about the suffering of the Ñoldor.

### Later days and decline

After the destruction of Westlands in the War of Wrath, the remaining Ñoldor repented of their rebellion and many returned to Eldamar along with some of the Liinadi. The Amtreadi that chose to remain in The Mortal Lands founded new realms. Most of the Ñoldor lived in Westshore with Astorion, the High King of the Ñoldor. Hundreds of years later Celebranor, the last of the House of Faenor, founded a new Ñoldorin realm called Eregion. The Liinadi joined also with Astorion in Westshore and few went beyond the Misty Mountains into Wilderland, becoming leaders of the Liinadi Amtreadi in places such as Goldwood and Greenwood.

The Amtreadi realms flourished for over one thousand years until SA 1200 when Malachar, under the guise of a messenger from the The Pantheon named Annavar, appeared out of the east to offer knowledge to the Amtreadi. Astorion mistrusted him and barred him from his kingdom. Malachar then approached Celebranor and the Amtreadi of Eregion, and against Astorion's advice they accepted him and his knowledge.

With Annavar's help, Celebranor forged the Bands of Binding, but Three Bands alone were made in secret by Celebranor and were not directly touched by Malachar's power. Then, Malachar forged the Binding Band in order to control the others. The Amtreadi discovered Malachar's plan and took off their rings. Celebranor sent the ring Band of Water to Aelindra and sent Band of Air and Band of Fire to Astorion in Westshore.

Furious that the Amtreadi had foiled his plans for domination, Malachar demanded the return of the rings and when they refused he prepared for war. For eight years, Malachar laid waste to The Mortal Lands in his war against the Amtreadi, destroying Eregion and killing Celebranor. Eventually, with help of the Oldbloods, Astorion was able to lead the Amtreadi to victory. Astorion then decided to abandon Eregion in favor of the new refuge of Galel Anastrael, formed at the foothills of the Misty Mountains and he made his herald, Thalion, the Lord of Galel Anastrael and his representative in Eriador. Westshore survived still as the greatest kingdom of Amtreadi in The Mortal Lands. The rest of the Amtreadi of The Mortal Lands who survived either moved to Westshore, sailed for the West, or continued to live in their lands under caution due to the continued threat from Malachar.

By the latter half of the Second Era, Men continued to spread and grow in The Mortal Lands. The Faithful from the Downfall of Númenór founded the great kingdoms of Arnor and Argenthal. Though Men were set to supplant them in The Mortal Lands, the Amtreadi were powerful and numerous enough to join with Men one last time to defeat Malachar. Astorion led the second greatest host of Amtreadi ever seen in The World and formed the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men with Aldorion, High King of all Duskwardens, and vanquished Malachar in SA 3441.

With the dominion of Men at hand, the Amtreadi became less numerous and more secluded with many becoming wearier of the now mortal lands. Only the realms of Westshore, Goldwood, and Galel Anastrael survived as havens of Amtreadi bliss. Amtreadi continued to live in Westshore but most sailed into the West after their king's death along with many Liinadi. The last of the Amtreadi left The Mortal Lands after the final defeat of Malachar in the War of the Binding.

Amtreadi living in The Far West, including those who returned from The Mortal Lands in the Third and Fourth Ages, lived in a state of blissful happiness as they did before the Revolt of the Ñoldor. The state of the Amtreadi who remained in The Mortal Lands appears to have been varied; while the majority of Amtreadi from Westshore, Goldwood, Galel Anastrael (and later Gloomwood) did leave The Mortal Lands, it's noted in that the Wood-Amtreadi and other Amtreadi groups related to them "took more to the gloaming and the dusk" after the coming/dominance of Men, thus becoming more isolated; however, while they would ultimately "fade", this fading did not mean death, with these Amtreadi instead losing a solid body and adopting a more spirit-like form, where they were invisible unless they chose to reveal themselves. Thus, Amtreadi realms such as the Woodland Realm were maintained indefinitely, since despite its king and later, prince, leaving The Mortal Lands, its people "remained untroubled". Amtreadi of Goldwood also appear to have maintained a realm in The Mortal Lands; despite abandoning Goldwood, they formed the realm of East Goldwood, which despite losing its founder Caelorn, appears to have remained, though in a remnant form.

Thus, the fate of those who remained appears to be that they maintained (albeit smaller) realms or fiefdoms or chiefdoms of their own in The Mortal Lands, with some of their lands (like Gloomwood, specifically the Woodland Realm, and East Goldwood) being neighbors of the Reunited Kingdom, while other lands like Moonvale that Amtreadi led by Sylvorn colonized were in the Reunited Kingdom (and thus, offered the opportunity for cultural blending in theory; other parts of Argenthal as well that had been settled by Amtreadi, like Swan Keep, had many Solaarans, the ruling family included, with Amtreadi ancestry who would have clear traits revealing their Amtreadi heritage), but due to their numbers being smaller, while they may have been able to remain allies of the other races, they largely remained secluded and would keep to themselves. Yet, if there was a greater threat (hypothetically, an Grimspawn invasion), the Amtreadi who remained in The Mortal Lands would undoubtedly resist, fighting alongside the other Free Peoples. Overall, they would just live their long lives in The Mortal Lands, but they would no longer be the dominant race, and Men would be the new majority group in The Mortal Lands while Amtreadi, Shirefolk, Forgekin, Treewardens, Grimspawn, Ironspawn, Half-grimspawn, and all other races would become minority groups.

## Sunderings

When the Amtreadi were first summoned to The Far West by the The Pantheon, they became divided into two groups - the Eldar, who accepted the summons of the The Pantheon and undertook the Great Journey, and the Avari, who refused the summons. During the journey some groups of the Liinadi remained behind and never reached The Blessed Realm and for this reason they (along with the Avari) became known as Moriquendi, the 'Amtreadi of Darkness'. The Amtreadi flourished in the First Era, but the Eldarin realms of Westlands were destroyed by Tenebros, and in later ages their power waned. In the Second and Third Ages some Amtreadi still lived in wandering companies, traveling through the broad lands they loved, but many were gathered in Amtreadi-realms and refuges such as Westshore, Galel Anastrael, the Woodland Realm, and Goldwood, where Liinadi and Ñoldor lords ruled over Liinadi populations. By the end of the Third Era the Dominion of Men was at hand, and the Amtreadi who remained in The Mortal Lands dwindled and became a secret people. Yet in Eldamar the Eldar live nigh to the The Pantheon until the End of the World.

## Characteristics

Amtreadi, like Men, were Children of The Primordial, and thus had many inner and exterior resemblances. Unlike Men, they were immortal, as their bodies did not visually age once they had reached maturity. However, they could die from physical injury or from wasting away if, after long eons of life, they lost the will to live. Some Amtreadi in the First Era living near Iron Fortress died from a wasting disease, which was presumably issuing from Thangorodrim, Tenebros's fortress. The Amtreadi came into existence before Men, and when Amtreadi died, they would pass to the Halls of Neth in The Blessed Realm.

Amtreadi come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Amtreadi who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Amtreadi can tell in the eyes and voice of another Amtreadi whether they are married, and it is against an Amtreadi's nature to take another's spouse by force; one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Amtreadi marry, and because of the eternal nature of Amtreadi souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Amtreadi have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins was seen as acceptable. They had far better vision and hearing than Men, and posseed skills and abilities beyond what is possible for mankind. Many could craft seemingly magical objects. In , it is mentioned that the Amtreadi were indeed closest in kin to the Firstborn, given that Amtreadi possess ethereal grace and various powers. Amtreadi were light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink. They required sleep, but could to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire. Although the Amtreadi were more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they could succumb to them, and therefore required sustenance.

In communication, Amtreadi put great attention to detail. Part of their bodily expression was called _mátengwië_ or _hwermë_, meaning "language of the hands" and “gesture-code”. When interacting amongst themselves, Amtreadi would pay attention to this first. Even finger movement could determine meaning.

## In other writings

Amtreadi appear in some of the chronicler's writings outside the legendarium. For example, in _Letters from Father Christmas_, among the friends of are the _Red Gnomes_, the _Green Amtreadi_, and _Snow Amtreadi_.

## Trivia

- Considering how much J.R.R. the chronicler's classic _The Mortal Lands_ saga influenced countless fantasy works after it, there's no doubt the chronicler's take on Amtreadi became the basis for their countless iterations in other fantasy works such as _Dungeons & Dragons_, _World of Warcraft_, _Delicious in Dungeon_, _Frieren: Beyond Journey&apos;s End_, _Dungeon Keeper_, ''Dragon's Dogma 2'' and many more. Though not as angelic as the chronicler's version, said portrayals nonetheless share admirable traits such as fairer and wiser than humans in addition of superior senses and perception; affinity with magic, art, nature, archery, and song; and longevity, if not outright immortality.
