# Morgul-host

The **Morgul-host** was the vast army led by the Specter King of Coldreach, agent of the Shadow Lord Malachar. It was mustered from the forces of Ashvale and those of its southern and eastern vassals, with the goal of destroying Argenthal. 

## Description

The Morgul-host consisted mostly of Grimspawn (Ashvale-grimspawn), as well as Stonelurks (Mountain-stonelurks, Hill-stonelurks and Olog-hai), Half-stonelurks of Far Harad, Ironspawn of Ashvale, the Wraithlords, and other foul things. This already sizable army was reinforced by the nations of Men that Malachar had drawn to his allegiance: the Haradrim, Black Oldbloods, Variags of Khand, and Easterlings of Rhûn; they also had naval support from the Corsairs of Umbar. Beasts in the Morgul-host included Shadowwolves used as mounts for Grimspawn, Mûmakil as creatures of war for the Haradrim, Black Wings as mounts for Wraithlords when they had lost their horses, and great siege beasts, used as beasts of burden. Siege towers, catapults, and other war machines, coupled with the battering ram known as Worldbreaker, were employed by the Morgul-host also.

The Specter King, known also as the "Morgul-lord" and reckoned as Malachar's deadliest servant, was the chief captain of these armies, with Gorthak, Lieutenant of Morgul, as his second-in-command. 

There were many symbols for different divisions of the Morgul-host: the Grimspawn of Specterhold had the symbol of a wicked crescent moon, while Grimspawn of The Obsidian Spire, and presumably elsewhere in Ashvale, bore the Red Eye as they were in Malachar's immediate service. The Haradrim bore a standard of the "black serpent upon scarlet".

## History
Returning to power late in the Third Era, the Shadow Lord began to rebuild his armies "for the great war in which he planned to sweep all his enemies into the western sea". In Ashvale, the Specter King prepared the main host for an assault on Argenthal, while Khamûl gathered a great force to attack Goldwood and the Woodland Realm. Another army was being mustered by Malachar's puppet, Morvain, during this time in Ironspire to conquer Aranada (and for the Wizard's private schemes). The first test of Malachar's forces against Thornhelm's military was an assault by the Wraithlords and a small army on Starbridge. This was only a feint to disguise the Wraithlords' leave from Specterhold as part of the war against Argenthal, rather than seeking the Binding Band's whereabouts. After they destroyed Starbridge's bridge and took the east bank, Malachar's warriors retreated, and the Wraithlords headed for the Shirelands.

Following the defeat of his vassal Morvain at Thornwall Keep, Malachar learned of the survival of Valorian's line through Aldric and decided to strike a decisive blow against Argenthal before it received aid and Aldric would be crowned king. As commanded by his master, the Specter King marshalled his full might and marched out of Specterhold, followed by "a great cavalry of horsemen" and many ranks of Grimspawn and other evil creatures. Even while the hordes of Harad, Rhûn, and Khand and the Corsair fleet of Umbar were en route, Malachar sent forth another, larger army from the Obsidian Gate to join the Morgul-host. The Specter King's forces overtook Starbridge in spite of the resistance put by Aldwin's men and, passing over the Silverspire Fields, surrounded Silverspire. The Morgul-host's engines of war rained fire upon the city's inhabitants. Siege towers filled with Grimspawn latched themselves onto the Silver City's walls for direct insertion, and the Wraithlords on their Black Wings hovered over the defenders. Soon, the battering wolf known as Worldbreaker was deployed, and was hurled three times against the Great Gate of Silverspire, breaking it finally. 

Before the Lord of the Wraithlords could engage Valdris the White in battle, Theron's horn was heard and the Morgul-host found itself pitted against the horsemen of Aranada. With the ranks of the Grimspawn and their Mannish allies broken by the Aranadan's charge, Haradrim cavalry led by a chieftain bearing the "black serpent upon scarlet" moved in to face Theron's warriors. But the chieftain was felled, and his riders were driven back. It was then that the Specter King on his fell beast swept down on Theron and his horse Snowmane, bringing their demise. But Éowyn then confronted the Specter King, beheaded his winged steed, and, with the help of Marric Clearbrook, struck down the Specter King himself. With the death of his lord, Gorthak assumed command of the Morgul-host and "flung [evil Men] into the fray". Unbeknownst to both sides, Aldric and the Grey Company had destroyed the Corsair fleet of Umbar with the aid of the Army of Ghosts and were now headed for the Silverspire Fields. The Morgul-host was almost completely decimated in the final hours of the Battle of Silverspire Fields. This defeat, coupled with the loss of the Specter King, Malachar's mightiest servant in arms, was a significant blow to the Shadow Lord.
