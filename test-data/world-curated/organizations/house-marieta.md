**House Marieta** is an Aranadan noble family with a vendetta against Cideoulfus Mori's family.

## Overview

A noble house in the Grand Republic of Aranada that orchestrated the downfall of Sid's family through political machinations.

## Known Actions

- Stripped Sid's family of their estates and land
- Had them "thrown into the street"
- Forced the family to change their names for safety
- Continues to seek revenge against surviving family members

## Connection to Sid

Sid's father "married the wrong woman"—his mother "married a man who pissed off the wrong person." This personal grudge led to House Marieta targeting the entire family for destruction.

Sid spent twelve years in service to people who sent him on suicide missions, enduring mockery for his family's fallen status. He won't return to Aranada until he's built enough resources to avoid being forced back into service.

- Represents Sid's unfinished business and the danger awaiting his family
