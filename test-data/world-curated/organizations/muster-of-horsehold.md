# Muster of Horsehold

The **Muster of Horsehold** were the Aranadan that could be mustered to war from Horsehold and the King's Lands, including those from Harrowdale in the White Mountains. By tradition, the Muster of Horsehold was under the command of the First Marshal of the Aranada. At the time of the War of the Binding, this tradition had lapsed, partly through the schemes of Morvain and Verin Snakewhisper. Though there was no First Marshal, the Muster did have a leader in Elfhelm, though he did not at that time carry the title of Marshal.
