Type: Religious
Influence: Universal
Relationship to Party: Neutral

The **Pantheon of Order** is one of three patron pantheons that shaped the mortal races of Enym. Drawing inspiration from **Temnis**, the Trinity member representing Structure, these gods embody the principles of law, hierarchy, and systematic organization.

## Member Deities

- **Anastrasael (The Starfather)** - Patron of Amtreadi (all subraces)
- **Volund (The World-Forger)** - Patron of Giants
- **Thoth (The Lawgiver)** - Patron of Saurians

## Divine Philosophy

The pantheon represents structure, law, hierarchy, and cosmic design - working with Dragons to create the structured Material Plane of Enym.
