# Shirefolk

**Shirefolk**, also known as **Shirefolk**, were a mortal race of The Mortal Lands. Though their exact origins are unclear, they were initially found in the northern regions of The Mortal Lands and below the Vales of Greatwater. At the beginning of the Third Era, shirefolk moved north and west. Most of their race eventually settled the land of the Shirelands, founded in the year TA 1601, though some among the Stoors remained in the Greatwater Vale. They were the fifth and last of the Free Peoples of the World.

## History

It is unknown when Shirefolk first appeared in The World. They are only known to have originated somewhere in the valley of the Greatwater River. By the time they were discovered by the other peoples of The Mortal Lands, they had already been around for many generations. The earliest known group of shirefolk lived in the Vales of Greatwater, in the region of Wilderland between Gloomwood and the Misty Mountains. According to , they forgot any genealogical ties to their relatives the "Big People" (Men). At this time, there were three breeds, or tribes, of Shirefolk, with different physical characteristics and temperaments: Harfoots, Stoors and Fallohides. While situated in the valley of the Greatwater River, the Shirefolk lived close by the Men of Éothéod, the ancestors of the Aranadan, and this led to some contact between the two. As a result, many old words and names in Shirelands-speech are derivatives of words in Aranadan.

About the year TA 1050, they undertook the arduous task of crossing the Misty Mountains. Reasons for this trek are unknown, but it possibly had to do with Malachar's growing power in nearby Greenwood, which was later named Gloomwood because of the shadow that fell on it. The three Shirefolk clans took different routes on their journey westward into Eriador, the Lone-lands. The Harfoots were the first to cross the Misty Mountains, and they migrated as far as the South Downs, a range of hills where the Harfoots long settled, establishing numerous dwellings there.  The Fallohides were the second to leave the vales, and they took the High Pass over the mountains, ending up north of Galel Anastrael. They traveled down the river Hoarwell before settling in the Angle, a triangular wooded land formed by the Hoarwell and river Loudwater. The Stoors were the last to migrate, and they crossed the mountains using the Redhorn Pass, traveling down the river Loudwater before settling in Swanfleet, a large marshy region near Dunland and Tharbad. In the following centuries some of the Stoors, dismayed by the power of Angmar and a change in the climate of Eriador, fled back east over the Misty Mountains. This group of refugees eventually gave birth to Slivven, but their fate is ultimately unknown, as their dwellings were abandoned by the end of the Third Era, likely as the Misty Mountains had become infested by Grimspawn. The Harfoots, Fallohides and remaining Stoors would journey further to the northwest and settle together in Crossway-land, where the divisions between the Shirelands-kinds began to blur, and where they found a friendly coexistence with the native Middle Men.

In the year 1601 of the Third Era, two Fallohide brothers named Marcho and Blanco gained permission from the King of Arthedain at Fornost to cross the River Baranduin and settle on the other side. Many Shirefolk followed them, and most of the territory they had earlier settled was abandoned. Only Crossway and a few surrounding villages lasted towards the end of the Third Era. The new land that they founded on the west bank of the Clearbrook was called the Shirelands. The crossing of the Clearbrook, as the shirefolk called it, was the event that led to the settlement of the Shirelands, thus the Shirelands-reckoning began.
Originally, the Shirefolk of the Shirelands swore nominal allegiance to the last Kings of Arthedain, being required only to acknowledge their lordship, speed their messengers, and keep the bridges and roads in repair. During the final fight against Angmar at the Battle of Fornost, the Shirefolk maintain that they sent a company of archers to help, but this is recorded nowhere else. After the battle, the kingdom of Arthedain was destroyed, and in absence of the king, the Shirefolk elected a Shirelands-thain from among their own chieftains.

The first Thane of the Shirelands was Bucca of the Marish, who founded the Oldbuck family. However, the Oldbuck family later crossed the Clearbrook River to create the separate land of Brookshire and the family name changed to the familiar "Clearbrook". Their patriarch then became Master of Brookshire. With the departure of the Oldbucks/Clearbrooks, a new family was selected to have its chieftains be Thane: the Ashford family (indeed, Perrin Ashford was son of the Thane and would later become Thane himself). The Thane was in charge of Shirelands Moot and Muster and the Hobbitry-in-arms, but as the Shirefolk of the Shirelands led entirely peaceful, uneventful lives, the office of Thane was seen as something more of a formality. The major political power in the Shirelands was actually held by the Mayor of Michel Hollow (the Shirelands's chief township). His duties included overseeing the post and the "police" force (Sheriffs); he was also obliged to preside at banquets.
The Shirefolk' numbers dwindled, and their stature became progressively smaller after the Fourth Era. However, they are sometimes spoken of in the present tense, and the prologue "Concerning Shirefolk" in *The Master of the Bands* states that they have survived into the chronicler's day.

## Types of shirefolk

-  The **Harfoots** were the most common Shirefolk. They were smaller and shorter than the other kinds and had browner skin. They did not grow beards and rarely wore shoes or boots. They were skilled with their hands and feet and preferred hillsides and highlands to live in. In ancient times, they had frequent contact with the Forgekin of The Mortal Lands and lived in the foothills of the Misty Mountains for a long time. While the other varieties of Shirefolk were still in the Wilderland, the Harfoots moved west, travelling across Eriador as far as the South Downs.

-  The **Stoors** often chose to live near water or on flat land. They were broader and heavier in build than the other Shirefolk and their feet and hands were larger. They were the most reluctant variety of Shirefolk to leave the River Greatwater, where some Stoors continued to stay. Others travelled west after the Harfoots and followed the River Loudwater southward. Many of the Stoors settled in the marshes of Swanfleet between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they continued north.

-  The **Fallohides**, who preferred trees and woodland, were the least common variety of Shirefolk. They had fairer skin and hair and were taller and slimmer than the others. They also had better relations with the Amtreadi of The Mortal Lands, were more skilled with language and song, and preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains north of Galel Anastrael and then followed down the River Hoarwell. They settled in a triangular forested region between the Hoarwell and Loudwater rivers, known as the Angle of Eriador.

Although the Shirefolk took different routes west, they eventually arrived in a land between the River Baranduin (which they renamed the Clearbrook) and the Weather Hills. There, they founded many settlements, and the divisions between the varieties of Shirefolk began to blur. By TA 3001, the Shirefolk of the Shirelands included families of Burrowses, Millbrooks, Ashfords, Clearbrooks, Grubbs, Chubbs, Hornblowers, Barleycorns, Bracegirdles, and Stoutfoots.

Originally, Fallohides were often found as leaders among clans of the other Shirefolk. In the year TA 1601, two Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, decided to journey across the River Clearbrook and settle on the other side. Large groups of Shirefolk followed them, and most of their former territory was depopulated. The Shirefolk who had left called their new home the Shirelands.

## Age and appearance

Most Shirefolk lived longer life spans than Men, a race of which they might have been an off-shoot. The average lifespan of a Shirefolk was about 100 years, though it was not unusual for a Shirefolk to live as many as three decades beyond that. The time at which a young Shirefolk matured and was accepted as an adult was 33, compared to a Man's 18 years. Thus, a 50-year-old Shirefolk would only be middle-aged. The most distinguishing feature of Shirefolk was their short stature. They were smaller than Forgekin and were usually between two and four feet in height. With the gradual passing of time, Shirefolk became even shorter. By the Third Era, they were usually less than three feet tall. Shirefolk' ears were slightly pointed and their furry feet had leathery soles, so they generally didn't need (and rarely wore) shoes or boots. the chronicler wrote that a typical Shirefolk had a "round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'amtreadan'."

Shirefolk were skilled listeners and had good eyesight. Although they were inclined to be fat and did not hurry unnecessarily, they were also nimble and deft in their movements. In *The Shirefolk*, Jasper manages to sneak up on the Stonelurks without them hearing him because he, like all Shirefolk, could walk around very quietly. The Shirefolk who lived in the Shirelands dressed in bright colors and were fond of yellow and green. Their hair usually ranged from a light or dark brown to blonde or a golden red and was almost always curly.

In the prologue to , the chronicler describes them as between two and four feet (0.6m-1.2m) tall, the average height being three feet, six inches. Elsewhere he specifies, "between 3 and 4 feet tall, never less and seldom more". They were not quite as stocky as the similarly-sized Forgekin, but still tended to be stout, with slightly pointed ears. the chronicler says the following of Jasper Burrows:
"I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of fairy rabbit as some of my British reviewers seem to fancy: fat in the stomach, shortish in the leg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'amtreadan'; hair short and curling (brown). The feet from the ankles down, covered with brown hairy fur that are extremely small. Clothing: green velvet breeches; red or yellow waistcoat; brown or green jacket; gold (or brass) buttons; a dark green hood and cloak (belonging to a forgekin)."the chronicler wrote also in the *Prologue* that they dress in bright colours, favouring yellow and green. Nowadays (according to the chronicler's fiction), they are very shy creatures, but they are and have been capable of amazing things. Their feet are covered with curly hair (usually brown, as is the hair on their heads) and have leathery soles, so most Shirefolk hardly ever wear shoes. Shirefolk (Shirefolk) are often depicted with large feet for their size, perhaps to visually emphasize their unusual nature (This is especially prominent in the influential illustrations by the Brothers Hildebrandt, and the large prosthetic feet used in the films by Peter Jackson). the chronicler does not specifically give size as a generic shirefolk trait, but does make it the distinctive trait of the Stoutfoot shirefolk clan. Shirefolk can sometimes live for up to one hundred and thirty years, although their average life expectancy is one hundred years. The time at which a young Shirefolk "comes of age" is thirty-three. Thus, a fifty-year-old Shirefolk would only look 26–30 years by human standards.

The only occurrences of Shirefolk speaking in other tongues as if naturally are the times in *The Return of the King* when Tomlen and Sam find themselves invoking Elbereth out loud, or when Tomlen cries the High Amtreadan phrase *Aiya elenion ancalima! *to break the spell of the Two Watchers at the Tower of Spider Pass.

### Lifestyle

Shirefolk were fond of an unadventurous bucolic life of farming, eating, and socializing. According to Jackson's trilogy, they enjoyed seven meals a day, when they could get them: breakfast, second breakfast, elevenses, luncheon, afternoon tea, dinner, and, later in the evening, supper. In the book, however, supper is simply an alternative name for dinner; Jasper only served three official meals at his Birthday Party: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). They like simple food such as bread, meat, potatoes, and cheese, and also like to drink ale, often in inns — such as the English country folk, who were the chronicler's inspiration. They have also been known to have a particular fondness for cake. The name the chronicler chose for one part of The Mortal Lands where the Shirefolk live, "The Shirelands", is clearly reminiscent of the English Shires. Shirefolk also enjoy smoking tobacco, which they refer to as "leaf-weed", out of long wooden pipes. This can be attributed to their love of gardening and herb-lore (as exemplified by Colben Greenhand). Another interesting fact is that shirefolk have an inordinate liking of mushrooms, prizing them above many other foods. A common pursuit for younger shirefolk is mushroom-hunting, and Tomlen Burrows said he had stolen Farmer Turnip's mushrooms on at least one occasion. Some Shirefolk live in shire-holes, known as "smials" which resembled the characteristics of the original places where they dwelt underground. They were found in hillsides, downs, and banks. By the late Third Era, only rich and poor shirefolk continued to live in smials; the middle-class shirefolk usually lived in large, low buildings, like Brook Hall. Almost every building in the Shirelands has round doors and windows, a feature more practical to tunnel-dwelling that the Shirefolk retained in their later structures.

Although Shirefolk are a peaceful people, who usually shun fighting, they are also, as a race, very courageous,  uncanny marksmen adept with missile weapons of all kinds, from throwing stones to slings and bows - hence the company of archers purportedly sent to aid the people of Arnor at the Battle of Fornost. Shirelands lore says that squirrels, rabbits, and other garden pests have learned to run away quickly if a shirefolk "so much as reaches for a pebble".

### Birthdays
In the Shirelands, birthdays were a very important event. The person whose birthday was being celebrated was called a *ribadyan*, which comes from the Anglo-Saxon word *byrding*.

On the birthday, the ribadyan would both give and receive gifts; however, the processes changed in function, origin, and etiquette. The ribadyan's reception of the gifts was the older of the two, and therefore most formalized. The expectation of receiving gifts was limited to near kin (up to their second cousins) within twelve miles, according to a fairly new law. This led to the phrase 'a twelve-mile cousin'; a person who saw obligations only within the law, and did as little as they could.

Instead of saying "one hundred and twelve" they say "eleventy two" and that with every other three plus digit number (although in Jackson's Trilogy, Jasper tells the party-goers that it was his One Hundred and Eleventh Birthday).

## Etymology and names

In the legendarium, the term *Shirefolk* is derived from the Aranadan word *Holbytla*, a word which means "Hole-builder". In the original Common Speech, the name was *Kuduk* (Shirefolk), derived from the actual Aranadan *Kûd-dûkan* (hole-dweller).

As Shirefolk and Éothéod once lived close together, some names appear to have been passed between the two cultures before they departed to new lands. Known are Fastred, the name of a man of Aranada that fell at the Battle of Silverspire Fields and Fastred of Greenholm who wed Elanor Gardner, and Harding, the name of a man of Aranada who fell at the Silverspire Fields and of Harding of the Hill living in Burrow's End, grandson of Tomlen Gardner.

## Background
The first appearance of the word *Shirefolk*, from the opening phrase of *The Shirefolk*, was a spontaneous creation by the chronicler, with only a few speculated linguistic derivations.

It is discussed in the last episode of the documentary series *Looking for the Shirefolk* how Shirefolk were a wholly original created race of the chronicler's imagination, with no clear roots in the real-world mythologies that inspired the rest of The Mortal Lands.

## Trivia
- Considering how much J.R.R. the chronicler's classic *The Mortal Lands* saga influenced countless fantasy works after it, there's no doubt Shirefolk became the basis for their countless iterations in other fantasy works such as *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Delicious in Dungeon*, *Dungeon Keeper*, and many more. Although, said works' iteration of shirefolk are traditionally called **Shirefolk** as opposed of Shirefolk.
- "Shirefolk" is used as shorthand to describe [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_floresiensis Homo floresinensis]; a species of diminutive human that once lived in modern day Indonesia.
