# Forgekin

**FORCETOC**

**Forgekin** were a race of The Mortal Lands also known as the **Drugan** (in their own tongue, from _dru_ "stone" + _gan_ "folk") or **Druthari** (High Amtreadan), **Nargan** meaning "**Stunted People**", and **Goronrim**, the "**Masters of Stone**". They are the oldest of the Free Peoples of the World.

## History

### Origin

The Forgekin were made by Kang-Somer, whom they themselves called _Mahal_, meaning “maker.” Kang-Somer wished above all for the Aenveladi to awaken so that he could love and teach them. But he was impatient, and in his impatience he chose to craft the Seven Fathers of the Forgekin in secret, in a hall under the mountains of The Mortal Lands. He made them similar in aspect to himself, and furnished them with tremendous strength of will and spirit so as to resist the predations of Tenebros's monsters.

It was however, not within Kang-Somer's power or authority to create life. As such the Seven Fathers were not truly alive, and were animated only when Kang-Somer's thought was upon them. But for Kang-Somer this was enough, and he began to teach them his crafts. The Primordial quickly came to know of the Forgekin' existence, and asked Kang-Somer why he had overstepped his authority. Kang-Somer, chastened, explained his desire for students to love and teach, but acknowledged his impatience and presumption. Weeping, Kang-Somer prepared to destroy his creations. But The Primordial intervened, understanding the purity and innocence of Kang-Somer's desire. In that moment, he granted the Forgekin true, independent life in the manner of the other Children, so that when Kang-Somer picked up his great hammer to smite the Seven Fathers, they cowered in fear and begged for mercy. The Primordial adopted the Forgekin as his own, and Kang-Somer was overjoyed. However, The Primordial did not wish to reward Kang-Somer's impatience, nor to disrupt the overall sequence of the arrival of the Children. He decreed therefore that the Seven Fathers should sleep underground, and come forth after the Firstborn had awakened. To this Kang-Somer gladly consented, and placed the Seven Fathers into a deep slumber to await the arrival of the Amtreadi. Subsequently, Thorngar went on many undocumented travels with his friend Sylvorn. In FO 120, Thorngar and Sylvorn boarded a ship that sailed down the river Greatwater, and then sailed to The Blessed Realm. Thorngar was thus the only Forgekin to ever be permitted to cross to the Eternal Shore.

Grundin VII (the Last), retook Shadowdeep and brought Shadowdeep back to its original splendor, and the Longbeards lived there till the "world grew old and the days of Grundin's race ended." 

## Culture

### Appearance

When Kang-Somer created the Forgekin, he had only a vague conception of what the Aenveladi should look like. Because of the threat of Tenebros over the world, Kang-Somer made them very strong in body and character.

Forgekin were a short, stocky race, a little taller than shirefolk, but much broader and heavier. Most had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and in some cases forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts.

Forgekin' armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that, in some cases, were "hideous" to look upon.

Forgekin women were alike in manner, voice and appearance to their menfolk. They were few in number, less than a third of all forgekin-kind, and they were seldom seen outside their own halls, often not venturing far due to their duties as caretakers and crafters in Forgekin society. They typically only travelled when in great need, and they usually dressed similarly to Forgekin men. This often led other folk to believe there were no women among the Forgekin, that Forgekin grew from stone when created. Few female Forgekin warriors were known, but some tales say that female Forgekin were as fierce as their male counterparts, especially in protecting their families and offspring. Forgekin were usually monogamous, and fewer than one-third of Forgekin men took a wife, the rest busying themselves with their crafts.

### Physiology

Forgekin were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Forgekin had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone.

Forgekin lived longer than Men,

One stronghold, Ironpeak (located in the Ironpeak), gained its wealth from precious gems hewn from rock and in "great seams of gold running like rivers through stone."

A name for where the Forgekin' were located was Phurunargian, which meant Forge-delving in the Common Tongue.

### Weapons and Armor

Forgekin soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because it can be used as a tool or a weapon, but in addition to axes they used hatchets, mattocks, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionally there is mention of Forgekin archers.

As for armor, Forgekin favored chain-mail and other metallic armor — the most expensive and precious of which was ring mail made of truesilver. A vest of truesilver was given to Jasper Burrows by Durgan before the Battle of Five Hosts. He wore it during the battle and it later protected his nephew Tomlen throughout his quest.) Valdris said that this small coat was worth more than the whole of the Shirelands combined.

### Language and writing system

#### Language

The Forgekin language was created by Kang-Somer when he created the Forgekin themselves, and called it _Forgespeech_, which simply meant 'Dwarvish'. The language was harsh sounding, and was strange to other peoples' ears. Only Forgekin were permitted to learn any of its words, for it was guarded jealously. When around other races, the Forgekin seldom spoke in it.

In the First Era, when Forgekin first made contact with Amtreadi, the only tongue in Westlands would have been Amtreadan, as the Ñoldor had not yet returned from The Far West. Consequentially, Amtreadan was spoken by the Forgekin. In fact, they were so impressed by the Amtreadan runes (the Cirth, made by Daeron) for writing Amtreadan that they adopted them for use in writing Forgespeech, and used them forever more.

#### Writing system

The Forgekin devised Angerthas, a rune-system based on Cirth. There were different variations of Angerthas, varying by each Forgekin clan; the Forgekin of Shadowdeep had their own variation with a number of unsystematic changes. The Forgekin of Ironpeak also used a further modification of the system, which was known as the mode of Ironpeak. This mode was notably exemplified in the Book of Mazarbul.

Some examples of Angerthas were seen in notable Forgekin texts, including the Book of Mazarbul, Thragor's Map, as well as other objects such as the Key to the Side-door.

### Music

Many songs were sung in the halls of the Forgekin. One very notable song was "Far over the Misty Mountains Cold", also known as the "Song of the Ironpeak," and commonly referred by fans as the "Forgekin Song." Another song sung in Forgekin culture was _In Shadowdeep, in Shadowdeep!_, which told of the history of Shadowdeep (Shadowdeep) and honored Grundin, first King of Grundin Folk. However, in times of war, Forgekin often refused to ally themselves with Amtreadi or Men, choosing to remain neutral or oblivious to the clashes between good and evil. During the early parts of the Third Era, it is known that in some places wicked Forgekin had made alliances with the goblins and Grimspawn. It is suggested by the chroniclers in some of their notes that the Forgekin that turned to wickedness most likely came from the far eastern mansions, and came under the Shadow of Tenebros and finally turned to evil. It is however unclear if these refer to Forgekin beyond the Iron Hills (the most eastern known stronghold of the Forgekin) Because Forgekin were not evil by nature, few ever served the Shadow of their own free will.
