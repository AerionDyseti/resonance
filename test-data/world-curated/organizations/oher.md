# Éoherë

An **éoherë** was the name used by the Men of the Éothéod for a full muster of their armed riders. When Eorl rode from the north to the aid of Argenthal, he led an éoherë of some seven thousand horsemen, as well as several hundred mounted archers. The successors of the Éothéod were the Aranadan, and they continued to use this term. In Theron's day, some five centuries after the Ride of Eorl, the full éoherë of Aranada was reckoned as one hundred éoreds, or a total of twelve thousand fighting men.
## Etymology
The word *éoherë* is Old English (*eoh* + *here*), and means (approximately) 'horse-host'. Translated into Oldbloods Amtreadan, this became the name Aranadan, the much more common term for the Men of Aranada.
