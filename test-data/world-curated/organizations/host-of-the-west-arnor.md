# Host of the West (Arnor)

The **Host of the West** was a combined allied force of Amtreadi, Men, and possibly Shirefolk during the Angmar conflict.

## Formation
The host composed of a vast army from Argenthal (actually just a small force compared to the full might of Argenthal) that arrived in a massive fleet, which hardly could find harborage, for its might filled Forlond, Harlond, and the Mistport.

The Northmen, proud princes of Rhovanion; riders tall and fair came with beautiful horses from the Vales of Greatwater that gathered most praise when they arrived at Mistport.

Harborel, Master of the Mistport, summoned all who would fight from the Amtreadi of Westshore, as well as the remnants of the Men of Arnor. Among the forces of former Arthedain it is said that there were some Shirefolk from the Shirelands.

## History
In , Arthedain was in danger and King Eärnil II sent his son Prince Eärnur and a massive fleet to their aid. After Arnor fell to Angmar, Prince Eärnur, in his capacity as Captain of Argenthal, reached belatedly Westshore with his fleet to the aid of Arthedain.

Although it was too late, the fleet and the host it brought, seemed so massive, that there was much joy and wonder among Amtreadi and Men. The allied host, led by Harborel and Eärnur, marched east across the river Lune to Fornost to challenge the Specter King, while the main body of the Host's horsemen, was to pass around the hills to surprise Fornost from the north. The Specter King was crushed at the Battle of Fornost ().

After the main part of the battle, the Host was joined by a force of Amtreadi from Galel Anastrael led by Aurindel, who chased the Specter King.
