# Tenebros's army

'''Tenebros's army''' was made up of many dark creatures. Tenebros used it to make war on the Amtreadi and Edain (Men) of Westlands in the First Era. His high-ranking officers were the fallen Ascended Gorthak and Malachar. Tenebros's main warriors were Grimspawn, which comprised the bulk of the army. At one stage they were so numerous they spread across the whole of Anfauglith. Werewolves were occasionally used as mounts. Gorthak led a grand portion of this army at times, and later Malachar.

The army consisted of:
- Grimspawn
- Stonelurks
- Dragons
- Flamefiends
- Spiders
- Vampires
- Werewolves
- Easterlings ("Swarthy Men")
- Things of Tenebros
