# Union of Maedhros

The **Union of Maedhros** was a short-lived alliance formed by Maedhros after the Battle of Sudden Flame. It sought to unite the Fëanorians with the other peoples of Westlands, including the Amtreadi of Hithlum, the Forgekin, the Edain and the newly arrived Easterlings. Due to tensions with the sons of Faenor, Deephold and Greyvale only sent small forces. The alliance was defeated at the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.

## Structure
The Union of Maedhros was divided into two armies in the east and west, led by Maedhros and High King Fingon respectively.

### Eastern army
- Amtreadi of Himring (Maedhros)
- Easterlings under the service of Maedhros (Bór)
- Easterlings under the service of Caranthir (Ulfang)
- Forgekin of Belegost (Azaghâl)

### Western army
- Amtreadi of Hithlum (Fingon)
- Men of Dor-lómin (Huran)
- Haladin (Vorniel)
- Amtreadi of Deephold (Gwindor)
- Some Falathrim
- Mablung and Beleg from Greyvale

## History
After the Battle of Sudden Flame, the Amtreadi had lost control over northern Westlands, and were mostly reduced to enclaves in Hithlum and Deephold, including the hidden Hidden City. When Maedhros heard of the heroic deeds of Beren and Luthiel new hope came to him. Maedhros decided to unite the peoples of Westlands to assail Iron Fortress.

Amtreadi, Men and Forgekin joined the alliance. The Forgekin of the Blue Mountains supplied both armed forces and forged weapons. Even to Hidden City came word of the Union and Turgon the Hidden King secretly made his own preparations. Other Amtreadi, like Orodreth, refused to join because of the evils of Celegorm and Curufin, while Thingol had sworn never to fight alongside the Feanorians; only a few representatives came from Greyvale and Deephold. 

Maedhros' plans were to lead his army (with some assistance from the western army) to Anfauglith in order to draw out the armies of Tenebros, and then flank with the hidden forces of Fingon that would emerge from the Ered Wethrin.

Initially, the forces managed to clean of evil creatures West Westlands and Dorthonion, and the final assault was planned for Midsummer. However, Tenebros had time to prepare his forces as Maedhros revealed himself too early, and then Uldor, who was an agent of the Shadow, delayed Maedhros' forces by giving false reports of enemy presence. A small force of Grimspawn managed to provoke the western army prematurely, instigated by Gwindor. As a result, the armies of the Union were themselves outflanked in the ensuing battle, which, despite Turgon's timely and unexpected arrival, would prove disastrous, and would be known as the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.
