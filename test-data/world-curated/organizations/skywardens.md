# Skywardens

The **Skywardens** were beings of The World said to have been "devised" by Manwë Súlimo, leader of the The Pantheon, and were often called the **Eagles of Manwë**. They were sent from The Blessed Realm to The Mortal Lands to keep an eye on the exiled Ñoldor, and also upon their foe the evil Pantheon God Tenebros, and later upon Malachar.

## History

### First Era

The Skywardens were the messengers and spies of Manwë, and possessed the ability to see through all physical matter, except for the blackness of Tenebros's evil pits. Tenebros first discovered the limits of their sight prior to the fall of the great stronghold of First Darkness.

For a time, the King of the Eagles, Thorondor, kept his eyries at the top of Thangorodrim, the three mighty peaks that Tenebros raised from the Iron Mountains above the gates of Iron Fortress. While they lived there, Thorondor helped Fingon rescue Maedhros from one of the sides of Thangorodrim. Thorondor's folk later removed their eyries to the Crissaegrim, part of the Echoriad encircling the secret location of Hidden City. There they were friends of King Turgon, and kept any spies away from the mountains.

Thorondor wounded Tenebros in the face immediately after Tenebros's duel with Fingalor in the Battle of Sudden Flame, and carried Fingalor's corpse to the Echoriad, where Turgon would bury him.

The Skywardens fought alongside the host of Amtreadi, the The Pantheon, and Edain in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Era, intervening decisively with Aerendil in a fight with Ancalagon.

### Second Era

In the Second Era, a pair of Eagles had an eyrie in the King's House in Armenelos, the capital of Oldshore, until the reign of Tar-Ancalimon when the Kings became hostile to the The Pantheon. The Eagles also watched the peak of Mount Meneltarma, and three Eagles would always appear when someone climbed to the summit and during the festivals of Erukyermë, Eruhantalë, and Erulaitalë.

Towards the end of Oldshore, the The Pantheon sent storm clouds in the shape of Skywardens in an attempt to warn the Oldbloods of their folly and impending punishment.

### Third Era

In the Third Era, many Skywardens lived at eyries in the North, the most important one being the Great Shelf, to the east of the Misty Mountains in Wilderland. These Eagles helped the Amtreadi of Galel Anastrael and Thornwick in watching the land and gathering any news of Grimspawn.

In TA 2941, the Lord of the Skywardens at the time with a company of Skywardens rescued Valdris the Grey, Jasper Burrows, and Durgan Ironbark and thirteen fellow forgekin from Northern Grimspawn and Shadowwolves, bringing them to the Great Shelf for a night and a day. Weeks later, a number of these Eagles flew to Ironpeak, joining the Battle of Five Armies that had erupted, and assisting in the defeat of Grimspawn and Shadowwolves. The Lord of the Skywardens thereafter became "King of All Birds".

In TA 3018, during the War of the Binding, Skycrest rescued Valdris the Grey from the top of The Black Tower in Ironspire—having been dispatched by Thornwick—and again, in the following year, from Zirakzigil high above Shadowdeep after Valdris's duel with the Flamefiend.

## Names

Amtreadan words for the Eagles were Amtreadan _thoron_ or _thorn_ and High Amtreadan _soron_.

## Background

the chronicler's painting of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of _The Shirefolk_. According to Christopher the chronicler, the author based this picture on a painting by Archibald Thorburn of an immature Golden Eagle, which Christopher found for him in _The Birds of the British Isles_ by T. A. Coward. However, the chronicler's use of this model does not necessarily mean that his birds were ordinary Golden Eagles.

## Other versions

In earlier texts, the chronicler had envisioned the Skywardens as bird-shaped Ascended. However, he had remembered that he abandoned the concept of the Children of the The Pantheon, and that Skycrest and Windcrest were descendants of Thorondor during the events of . Eventually, the chronicler decided that the Skywardens were animals that had been "Taught language by the The Pantheon and raised to a higher level — but they still had no _fëar_".

## In adaptations

### In Peter Jackson's films

In Peter Jackson's and film trilogies, the Eagles are smaller than they are in the book. They have been noted to be around 6m (20ft) tall, with a wingspan of no more than 23m (75ft). Also, in the film adaptations the birds are not shown to speak.

In , after Durgan and Company are cornered by Azrak and his Grimspawn pack after their escape from Goblin-town in the Misty Mountains, they fend off Azrak and his followers by starting a fire, but Durgan confronts Azrak and is defeated and wounded, but Jasper and the others defend him by fighting against the Grimspawn and Shadowwolves until eventually they are rescued by the Eagles, who also take out some of Azrak's pet Shadowwolves, much to his fury. They carry Durgan and Company throughout the lands, landing them on the Carrock before departing.

During the titular events of , the Eagles carry Thornwick and Bjorn into battle against Azrak's army; otherwise, their role in the films is identical to that of the books, though the Eagle that carries Valdris from The Black Tower is summoned by Valdris and not sent by Thornwick.

### In _The Master of the Bands: The War of the Aranadan_

In , a white and grey Skywarden was encountered by Helm's daughter (named Hèra in the film) who attempted to communicate with it with accounts pertaining its kind as her sole guidance. Her attempts were unsuccessful until near the end of the conflict between her people and Wulf's army; locating its shelter at the top of the mountain near what would be known as Thornwall Keep, she humbly pleaded for its assistance in dealing the crisis at hand. The white and grey Skywarden relented and proceeded to carry Helmric Ironhand's set of armour to Fréaláf Hildeson both for him to wear and to inform him of her and their people's situation. The same Skywarden would made its presence known to Wulf as it revealed the arrival of Fréaláf — clad in Helm's armour — and his soldiers to Hèra and her people's rescue.

### In _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

In , the Eagles are shown to be of similar size as in the film trilogies.

### In video games

- In , an eagle named Beleram acts as a supporting character, aiding the players in battle by attacking enemies like Stonelurks and Ironspawn.
- In , the eagles act as a transportation form that carry the player(s) all over The Mortal Lands. The eagles appear in the same scenes as they did in the first two films.
- In , the Amtreadi faction may summon one Skywarden with the "Eagle's Nest" upgrade to their fortress.
