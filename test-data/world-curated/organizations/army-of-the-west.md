# Army of the West

The **army of the West**, also called the **Host of the West**, was the great host prepared by the Lords of Argenthal and Aranada to march on the Obsidian Gate after the Battle of Silverspire Fields.  

## History
### Formation
Creating the Host of the West was first suggested by Valdris in the Last Debate. The rationale behind this suggestion was that, although Malachar could not be defeated with arms, they could draw out the army of Ashvale, making it easier for Tomlen and Sam to reach Doomfire Peak undetected. Whether or not they should attempt to assail Specterhold was a subject of debate, but Valdris argued strongly against this, as the minds of men turned to madness and horror at Specterhold and would risk drawing the Watcher of Malachar near Tomlen and Sam. It was decided that a host of 7,000 men, if that many could be found, would depart in two days.

By noon the army had reached Starbridge, which was in the process of being rebuilt. The vanguard continued for five miles further before stopping for the day, while the horsemen pressed on and reached the Cross-roads. At the Cross-roads, the captains stationed a strong force of archers there to guard against any attack from the East or South. The next day, Aldric and Valdris, along with the vanguard, rode ahead and reached Specter Vale.

On the third day, the host left the Cross-roads, leaving behind the force of archers to defend the Cross-roads. They encountered a force of Grimspawn and Easterlings attempting to ambush them. Having been warned by their scouts, they were able to easily defeat the force, though Aldric felt that the purpose of the army had been to give the host a false impression of the enemy's weakness rather than hurt them. From the evening onward, the host was followed by the eight remaining Wraithlords. 

On 23 March, the Army exited Moonvale, and along the way some faint-hearted men who would not approach the Obsidian Gate were dismissed and commanded to liberate River Keep. Between these men and the men left at the Cross-roads, over 1,000 were lost, leaving the army less than 6,000 strong. The next day, the same day that Sam and Tomlen reached the foot of Doomfire Peak, they finally reached the Desolation of the Obsidian Gate, camping there as they waited for an answer to their challenge.

### Battle of the Obsidian Gate
On 25 March, with no response from Ashvale, the host assembled and marched to the Obsidian Gate, demanding that the Lord of the Black Land come forth so that justice could be done upon him. The Obsidian Gate was thrown open and an embassy from the Obsidian Spire rode out, led by the Voice of Malachar. The Voice of Malachar showed them items belonging to Sam and Tomlen and relayed to them his lord's terms. After rejecting these terms, a great host came through the Obsidian Gate, thus beginning the Battle of the Obsidian Gate.

The host was quickly trapped as the army of Ashvale swarmed them from all sides of the Slag-hills. They fought Grimspawn, hill-stonelurks, Easterlings, Southrons, and the Wraithlords. Despite being vastly outnumbered and surrounded, the host fought well and was able to hold their own long enough. It is not told how many casualties the army suffered.

### Disbandment
After the victory at the Battle of the Obsidian Gate the host headed south, and set up camp on the Field of Cormallen. There Aldric healed the exhausted Tomlen and Sam following their rescue from the wreck of Doomfire Peak and put them in a long sleep. On 8 April after waking up from their long rest the Ringbearers were received and praised before the Host of the West in a celebration of the victory in the War of the Binding.

The host then rested there for many days, though some of their forces continued battling remnants of the Easterlings and Southrons until they were fully defeated. Some of the host even passed into Ashvale to destroy fortresses in the north of the land. By the end of April all forces had returned to camp and they begun their journey back toward Silverspire. They arrived at the city on last day of April, and the next morning on 1 May Aldric was crowned King before the gates of the city and the great host.

On 8 May Éomer departed with the his forces to return to Aranada, whilst at the same time all others that dwelt far from the city returned to their homes, effectively disbanding the Host of the West.

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:*'
:The last debate includes King Theron, Sylvorn and Thorngar with Imrahil, Elloran, and Elrodan absent. Aldric suggests the creation of the Army of the West and Valdris is initially doubtful that it will be successful. Before the Army leaves Aldric looks into the seeing-stone. The journey from Silverspire to the black gate is not shown. When the Band is destroyed the ground beneath the enemy's army crumbles and Malachar's army is no more.
