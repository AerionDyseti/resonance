# Hobbitry-in-arms

The **Hobbitry-in-arms** was the militia of the Shirelands. The captain of the Hobbitry-in-arms was the Thane, who summoned it at a Shirelands-muster in times of emergency.

The last battle to take place within the borders of the Shirelands before the War of the Binding, and so presumably the last time the Hobbitry-in-arms was mobilised, was the Battle of Greenfields in  (S.R. 1147). Shirefolk did not fight amongst themselves, and for the next centuries they had been sheltered from the dangers of the outside world by the efforts of the Wardens, of which they were largely unaware. By the end of the Third Era the existence of an armed hobbitry was largely a relic of harder times. What store of weapons remained in the Shirelands were trophies hanging on walls or displayed in the Mathom-house at Michel Hollow.

In  a hastily-assembled hobbitry under the command of Marric Clearbrook ejected the Ruffians from the Shirelands in the Battle of Bybrook. It is not clear whether this constituted an official mobilisation of the Hobbitry-in-arms, although the contingent from Tookland was raised by Thane Paladin Ashford II and led by his son and heir Perrin Ashford.
