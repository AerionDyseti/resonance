# Solaaran Military Forces

The **military of Argenthal** was a powerful force in The Mortal Lands that opposed Malachar in the late Second and Third Era.

## Infantry

### The War of the Final Alliance

Within a century of Argenthal's founding, it was put to a severe test during the War of the Final Alliance. In an alliance with Arnor and Amtreadi forces from Westshore and Rhovanion, Argenthal fought a series of battles against the forces of Malachar.

### Third Era

During the Third Era, Argenthal's military prowess eventually declined. The major difference was the Solaaran soldiers themselves: although the soldiers would have proudly fought to the last man, they were never as strong as the warriors of the past especially by the second half of the Third Era. After the Great Plague and the Kin-strife, which left Argenthal very weakened, many Oldbloods of pure blood had perished during those troublesome times. The Solaaran military wore chain-mail armour with helmets graven with a small silver star.

The Prince and **Captain of Argenthal** Earnur organized the Host of the West, joining forces with Arnor and Amtreadi.

The **Guards of the Citadel** wore black mail with truesilver helms and a black and silver surcoat.

## Cavalry

Traditionally, Argenthal had a small cavalry force. In the last quarter of the Third Era, its close ally Aranada often supplied the bulk of its cavalry forces. This was true during the Wainrider/Balchoth War as well as during the War of the Binding. Before the Battle of Silverspire Fields, a mixed force of infantry and cavalry retreated from the Causeway Forts and Starbridge to the citadel of Silverspire. Pursued by Grimspawn on the ground and Wraithlords from the sky, these forces were in great peril. Lord Thornhelm, Steward of Argenthal, finally released a mounted counter-attack against them, which drove them back. Leading this attack was the Prince Imrahil of Swan Keep and his mounted swan-knights. These men represented the elite cavalry force of Argenthal.

## King's Ships

The '''King's Ships** constituted the sea-going defence forces of the Southern kingdom of Argenthal. They were often in action against the forces of Umbar, as reavers would attack the coast of the South Kingdom.

Before the Downfall of Oldshore, it had been known as a mighty sea power, the greatest that ever existed in The Mortal Lands. Previously they had sent great fleets, under Minastir, to the aid of Astorion against Malachar in the middle of the Second Era. Aldorion and his sons, who founded Arnor and Argenthal, were all great mariners; therefore, there was a long distinguished tradition of shipbuilding, sea exploration, and sea-power projection. By , the **Captain of the Hosts** Tarannon was engaged in heavy fleet building, and became known as the first of the Ship-kings of Argenthal. These fleets were usually based at Pelargir, and sometimes Umbar.

During the Kin-strife, the **Captain of Ships''' was Castamir who used his position to find supporters against the King. After the Kin-strife, the defeated rebels took refuge in Umbar, where they long troubled Argenthal. Late in the Third Era, Eaglecrown (Aldric II) led a Solaaran naval task force in a raid known as the Surprise Attack on Umbar. This was a successful raid that neutralized the Corsairs' naval power for decades, and reduced the southern pressure on Argenthal at a time when its power was waning.

## Special forces
Soldiers fully trained and experienced had the title of *ohtar* 'warrior, soldier'. Some were admitted to the rank of *roquen*, "knight".

Several groups were armed men operating often behind enemy lines. Late in the Third Era, as the power of Ashvale grew, Argenthal withdrew most of its conventional forces from east of the Greatwater, including North and South Moonvale. They did not abandon the area completely, however, and maintained a guerilla presence there, the **Wardens of Moonvale**. During the War of the Binding, this force was commanded by Aldwin, son of Thornhelm II. They acted as a reconnaissance force, and often harassed Malachar's forces.
