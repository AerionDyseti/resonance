# Host of The Blessed Realm

**NOTOC**
The **Host of The Blessed Realm**, also known as the **Host of the West**, was a great force that crossed the Sea from The Far West and defeated Tenebros in the War of Wrath, which ended the First Era.

## History

Moved by the words of Aerendil the Mariner, the The Pantheon agreed to come to Westlands and confront Tenebros. In FA 545, they assembled a great force led by the Ascended Bahamet that consisted of Luth and all of the The Pantheon, the Amtreadi and Ñoldor Amtreadi of The Blessed Realm (under Ingwion and Finarfin) and a great many of the Ascended. The Liinadi agreed only to provide and sail the ships bearing across the Sea but would not participate in any other way due to their bitterness over the infamous kinslaying.

In Westlands the The Blessed Realm host was quickly joined by the assembled Edain, Forgekin from all seven clans and the remaining Ñoldor and Liinadi of The Mortal Lands. It was said to have been the greatest force of arms the world had ever seen, and would only be rivaled by the Great Armament of Ar-Pharazôn millennia later.

They met the forces sent by Tenebros in Anfauglith and warred with them there for nigh on forty years, but at last were able to secure victory. As they approached the Gates of Iron Fortress, they were suddenly driven back by the assault of a fleet of great winged Dragons led by Ancalagon the Black. Aerendil came forth in Vingilot, and was joined by the Eagles led by Thorondor; they reinforced the Host of the The Pantheon and defeated the forces of Tenebros. Ancalagon himself was slain, and destroyed the towers of Thangorodrim in his fall. Finally, the host routed all remaining foes in the pits of Iron Fortress, and captured Tenebros, effectively ending his reign in The Mortal Lands.

This Host was prophesied to assemble once more for the Dagor Dagorath at the end of days (after Tenebros's return from behind the Door of Night), in which they would be victorious.
