Relationship to Party: Neutral

The **Kingdom of Hyria** was an independent human kingdom that existed before the **Unification Crusades (625-705 MR)**. Its capital, **Highwind City**, would eventually become the heart of the **Grand Republic of Highwind** after the kingdom was forcibly united with other human territories.

## Pre-Unification Period

**Independent Kingdom:**

- **Sovereign territory** during the **Age of Expansion** and early **Age of Conflict**
- **Capital at Highwind City** - a major center of commerce and politics
- **Republican tendencies** even before the formal republic was established
- **Resistance** to the Unification Crusades' forced integration

## The Unification Crusades (625-705 MR)

**Forced Integration:**

- **Prompted by prophecy** - the King of Hyria received visions of unity
- **Military conquest** - Hyria used force to unite human kingdoms
- **80-year campaign** that reshaped the political landscape
- **Formation** of the Grand Republic of Highwind as the end result

## Transformation to Republic

**Political Evolution:**

- **Kingdom dissolved** into republican structure
- **Highwind City** remained the capital of the new republic
- **Democratic institutions** replaced monarchical rule
- **Cultural continuity** - many Hyrian traditions persisted in republican form

- **Cautionary tale** about the costs of forced political change
