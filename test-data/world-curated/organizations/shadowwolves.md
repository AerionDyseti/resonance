# Shadowwolves

**Shadowwolves** were a breed of wolves, commonly living in the Misty Mountains, that served Malachar the Shadow Lord and his agents in the conflicts of the Third Era. Often in league with the nearby Northern Grimspawn, they were also used as mounts by the Grimspawn of Ironspire and Ashvale.

## History

In TA 2941, a group of Shadowwolves made a pact with the Grimspawn of Goblin-town to raid the villages of the Woodmen of Western Gloomwood, whom they planned to expel or enslave. As the great grey chief wolf and his pack approached the meeting-place east of the mountains, they happened upon Durgan's Company along with Valdris and Jasper Burrows, who had just escaped from the same Grimspawn. The Wizard had anticipated this, suggesting the Company climb up a nearby stand of trees. This was done, and Dori helped Jasper out of the Shadowwolves' reach just in time.

Thinking the Forgekin were spies of the Woodmen, the Shadowwolves surrounded the glade and prevented them from descending. Valdris lit up pine-cones and hurled them against the Shadowwolves, until they were driven out. The wolves that had caught fire fled into the forest and had set it alight in several places, as it was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. Grimspawn soon appeared, and set the trees on fire. However, the Skywardens soon arrived and rescued the Company.

Not long after the news of the Dragon Scorath’s death spread throughout The Mortal Lands, legions of Grimspawn, Shadowwolves and Bats gathered at Gundabad in a bid to avenge the Great Goblin and claim the north, including the Ironpeak, as their own. The host was defeated in the ensuing Battle of Five Armies by the allied forces of Forgekin, Amtreadi, Lake-men, and Skywardens, while the Grimspawn leader, Bolgrak, was slain.thumb|250px|A Shadowwolf eyeing Thorngar in Peter Jackson's films|alt=
Even decades later, Shadowwolves were still counted among Malachar's minions, alongside Grimspawn, wraiths, and werewolves; Valdris mentioned them as such to Tomlen Burrows. Around July 10 of TA 3018, Malachar's vassal Morvain gathered Shadowwolves and some Northern Grimspawn at Ironspire; he was building an army, both to "deliver" Aranada to his "dark master" and to try  claim the Binding Band for himself.

On January 13 of TA 3019, the Company of the Band was attacked by a group of wolves sent by the Shadow Lord to waylay them after the failed attempt to cross the Redhorn Pass. The Shadowwolves fled after their first attack, in which one of their chiefs, the "Hound of Malachar", was shot in the throat by Sylvorn. Returning with reinforcements, the Shadowwolves made another sortie upon the company, but this second attempt also failed, with the last three leading wolves meeting their end at the hands of Aldric, Valdric and Sylvorn. By morning the Company noticed that the carcasses of the slain had vanished and Valdris concluded that their attackers were likely Shadowwolves and not ordinary wolves. Aldric knew them to be from "the mountains".

That same year during the War of the Binding, Wolf-riders were among the forces Morvain sent against Theron's son, Theodric, and the Aranadan in the Battles of the Fords of Iron. Later during the king's retreat to Thornwall Keep, a scout reported that Wolf-riders were abroad in the valley. Though the mounts were likely Shadowwolves, the wolves were not specifically identified as such.

## Physical attributes

Shadowwolves are described as being larger, intelligent, and more malevolent wolves.

## Etymology

The word ***shadowwolf*** comes from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Old Norse] *vargr*, meaning "wolf". The Old Norse word is a stand in for a word in one of the Northern languages.

## In adaptations

### *The Shirefolk* (1977 animated film)
In the 1977 animated adaptation of *The Shirefolk*, Valdris, Jasper, and the Forgekin are being chased by Wolves (Shadowwolves) and like the book, are chased up a tree. The Wizard defends the group from the wolves, using magic infused pinecones, until Grimspawn wolf-riders begin to burn the tree. However, they are soon rescued by Skycrest and his Eagles.

### Peter Jackson's films
#### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
The Gundabad Shadowwolves are wolf-like with grey fur, and are bred by the Grimspawn of Mount Gundabad. Throughout the events of *The Shirefolk* film trilogy, a large pack of these Shadowwolves are in the service of Malachar's agent Azrak, who had survived the battle at Shadowdeep. Among these Shadowwolves is a larger one with a white pelt that Azrak rides, revealed in *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey Chronicles: Creatures & Characters* guide book to be the Shadowwolf Matriarch of the Gunbabad Shadowwolves. Although more prominent, her role is based on that of the great grey chief wolf that appears in the source material. Valdris states in *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey* that the Gundabad Shadowwolves are faster than any other breed.thumb|right|260px|Azrak's female white Shadowwolf

In the events of *An Unexpected Journey*, a pack of Shadowwolf-riders led by Azrak's lieutenants, Yazneg and Fimbul, stalk the company of Durgan Ironbark before making their presence known in the Trollshaws. Though Thornwick offers to distract their pursuers by riding on his sled pulled by Rhosgobel Rabbits, the Shadowwolf-riders spot the Company and chase after them before finding themselves ambushed by the Amtreadi of Galel Anastrael after the Forgekin flee into the Hidden Pass. At the Grimspawn camp on Windcrest, Azrak feeds Yazneg to the starved Shadowwolves for returning empty-handed. Seeking Durgan's head, the Defiler later rides the Shadowwolf Matriarch to personally hunt Ironbark, pursuing him to the Misty Mountains. Though the Hunter Grimspawn and Shadowwolves corner the Company in a pine forest, the Forgekin manage to elude them with the aid of both the Skywardens. 

In *The Desolation of Scorath*, Azrak and his horde of Shadowwolf-riders pursue Durgan's Company towards Gloomwood, but Bjorn's presence cheats them out of their quarry. Summoned by master to Dol Guldur, Azrak is charged with commanding Malachar's armies and leaves Bolgrak to lead the pack in his stead.  Trailing the company to Lake-town, Bolgrak sends several Shadowwolf-riders that Durgan has reached Ironpeak back to Malachar, before engaging Sylvorn. After their short duel, the spawn of the Defiler escapes on a wolf mount. alt=|thumb|260x260px|A Shadowwolf pack in *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey*|left

In *The Battle of Five Hosts*, Azrak rides the Shadowwolf Matriarch on the march to the Ironpeak. A Shadowwolf-mounted Bolgrak intercepts him, telling him of the Amtreadi' involvement in the Quest of Ironpeak before being sent to retrieve reinforcements from Gundabad. At the mountain stronghold, Sylvorn and Tauriel watch as Bolgrak, mounted on his Shadowwolf, calls the legions forth. In the Extended Edition, a company of forty Gundabad Shadowwolves, including between fifteen and twenty Shadowwolf-riders, are part of Azrak's massive army during the Battle of Five Armies. As Durgan's best warriors hasten to Ravenhill to confront Azrak, these Shadowwolves pursue the group on an icy lake, preying on the goats that drive the charriot in an attempt to stop the Forgekin. 
#### *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy

The eastern Shadowwolves seen in the *Master of the Binding* film trilogy are noticeably hyena-like in appearance. They are bred by the Grimspawn of Ironspire and Ashvale. A horde of these Shadowwolves led by the scarred veteran Sharku are in league with Malachar's agent Morvain. 

In *The Two Towers* film, Morvain sends Sharku and his Shadowwolf-mounted Isengarders to waylay  the people of Aranada before they reach Thornwall Keep. A Shadowwolf-rider scout ambushes Hagan and Garmund before the rest of the horde arrives to engage the Aranadan. Sharku himself battles Aldric, and his Shadowwolf falls with Aldric off of a cliff into a river. The Shadowwolves and their riders lose the battle, and the survivors flee. Theron bids his men leave the dead and carry the wounded on horseback to Thornwall Keep, as the "wolves of Ironspire will return". 

In *The Return of the King* film, the Specter King's lieutenant, Gorthak, uses a Shadowwolf as a mount during the Siege of Argenthal and several other Shadowwolves can be seen storming the city with their Grimspawn riders. In commentary in the Special Extended Edition of the film, Jackson said that the scene was chaotic to shoot, and that the Shadowwolves were the only computer-generated creatures he felt could have looked more convincing. He also thought the scene itself could have turned out better if his team had a more organized storyboard layout for the battle.
