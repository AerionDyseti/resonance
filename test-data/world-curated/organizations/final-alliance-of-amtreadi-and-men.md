# Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men

The **Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men** was formed in of the Second Era in response to the threat of conquest by the Shadow Lord Malachar.

## History

Malachar had been contending with the Amtreadi for mastery of The Mortal Lands for over 1200 years. Fearing the establishment of the powerful kingdoms in exile &mdash; Arnor and Argenthal &mdash; by his hated enemies, the Duskwardens, Malachar launched a pre-emptive attack on Argenthal in .

Valorian left Tower of Moon for the north to meet his father and High King of the Duskwardens Aldorion, whilst Anareth, Aldorion's younger son, defended Starbridge against the hosts of Ashvale. The Primordial's name was very rarely invoked in oaths, and among the Oldbloods it was held that only the King could call upon Him. This would happen again only thousands of years later during the Oath of Cirion. and marched towards Galel Anastrael in where they camped for three years, Their forces were strengthened in the Vales of Greatwater by Amtreadi from Goldwood and Greenwood under the command of Oropher and Amdír and by the Forgekin of Shadowdeep.

When Malachar learned of their advance, he burned the former Gardens of the Treewarden-wives to hinder them down the Greatwater.

Soon they reached Battle Plain where they met and defeated Malachar's army in the Battle of Battle Plain after months of fierce fighting. Malachar retreated, and the Alliance breached the Obsidian Gate into Ashvale, marching to besiege the Shadow Lord's fortress of The Obsidian Spire. The siege lasted for seven years, during which the Alliance sustained heavy losses; among others, Anareth was slain. It culminated in Malachar leaving his fortress and breaking the siege himself. Malachar's last sortie pushed the army of the Alliance back to the slopes of Doomfire Peak. Malachar's body died and his spirit fled. Without the power of the Binding Band, Malachar could not take form again in The Mortal Lands for a thousand years.

With the victory over Malachar and the death of Astorion and Aldorion, the Final Alliance was dissolved. The remaining Oldbloods resettled their kingdoms.
