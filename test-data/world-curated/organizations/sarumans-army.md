# Morvain's army

'''Morvain's army''' was the 10,000-strong army of the Wizard Morvain, treacherous agent of the Shadow Lord Malachar. Amassed at Ironspire in the years leading to the of the War of the Binding, Morvain planned to use this great force to conquer Aranada for his "new master", but also to try seize the Binding Band first and claim it for himself.

## Description

The army mainly consisted of Grim-kind creatures, ranging from the common Grimspawn to Half-grimspawn and Ironspawn. The Wizard Morvain was also allied with the wild men of Dunland, and had a number of Shadowwolves used as mounts for the Grimspawn. The primary emblem displayed by the warriors of Ironspire was the  "White Hand of Ironspire" - a white hand painted on their shields. The host was equipped with siege ladders, a battering ram, and the "fire of The Black Tower", an explosive device of Morvain's making.

## History

Betraying the Grey Council, Morvain claimed Ironspire as his seat of power and turned his sights upon Aranada. Surrounding himself with the Aranadan's enemies, he also started making his own Grimspawn around TA 2990 and eventually crossbred them with Men. By TA 3000, Morvain had become Malachar's vassal and was instructed to "deliver" the kingdom to his "dark master". Soon after, Morvain's Ironspawn began making sorties with Grimspawn from the Misty Mountains and Ashvale into eastern Aranada. The Wizard's army continued to grow, but it was "not in [Malachar's] service yet" and its goal was to claim the Binding Band for Morvain instead. During his imprisonment in The Black Tower, Valdris witnessed Morvain gathering hordes of wolves and Grimspawn in Ironspire. 

During the War of the Binding, Morvain began his open war against Theron on Malachar's behalf, and his war-bands made incursions into Aranada's lands.  In TA 3019, an Grim-host from Ironspire, reinforced by hordes from Dunland, fought with Theodric at the Fords of Iron. The First Battle at the Fords of Iron ended in the retreat of Morvain's army, which had fulfilled its orders: the slaying of Theodric. The Wizard then betrayed his new master and sent a company to hunt down the Company and capture the Band-bearer. Morvain's scouts ambushed the Company at Hill of Sight and escaped with two of the Shirefolk (neither of which actually had the Band), but were destroyed by the Riders of Aranada on the outskirts of Deeproot Forest. 

His plans for supremacy ruined, Morvain tried to appease Malachar by unleashing his army - now numbering 10,000 warriors, including many Ironspawn - upon the Aranadan. Though facing some opposition in the Second Battle at the Fords of Iron, the legions of Ironspire pressed on towards Thornwall Keep, where Theron sought to make a stand. Throughout the Battle of the Thornwall, Morvain's army dominated much of the skirmish and almost overran the Aranadan defenders, having both breached the wall with explosive craft and climbed it with ladders. However, the unexpected arrival of Aranadan reinforcements turned the tide in Theron's favour and the Ironspawn were vanquished. The last of Morvain's main army was then wiped out by the vengeful Huorns as they fled.

A small portion of Morvain's warriors stayed at Ironspire during the attack on the Thornwall, and fought the Treewardens in the march to Ironspire. By the next day, March 3 of TA 3019, this remnant was utterly destroyed by Rootbeard, Perrin, Marric, and the Treewardens, save for an unknown number of Dunlendings who surrendered to the victors.

## In other versions
In the earlier drafts of , Morvain's army was merely another division of Malachar's forces. During his imprisonment in The Black Tower, Valdris witnessed Morvain gathering hordes of Grimspawn and wolves to do the bidding of his new master. In these versions of the story, the army of Ironspire, seeing the "war-beacons afar off blazing in Ashvale", would join the hosts of Rhûn, Harad, Dol Dúghul (Dol Guldur), Shadowdeep and Ashvale in a massive assault against Ondor (Argenthal); Morvain himself would have been present at the Siege of Silverspire, commanding Malachar's armies.  

## In adaptations

In Peter Jackson's , Morvain's army is portrayed as the second army of Malachar. According to the tie-in , Malachar wanted a another force at Ironspire with which to destroy Aranada and "to form a second pincer with which to crush Argenthal", so he instructed his servant Morvain to build him one. This portrayal closely mirrors that of the earlier drafts of the novel.

In  film (2002), the culvert of the Thornwall was breached by a group of exceptionally strong Ironspawn called "Berserkers", one of whom rushes forth with a flaming torch in hand, undeterred by an wave of arrows piercing him from above. He throws himself into the culvert, and thus ignites the bomb that explodes and breaks the Deeping Wall - called only the "fire of The Black Tower" in the , by Aldric.

Many Ironspawn in the host are shown using crossbows, which were not mentioned by the chronicler. The White Wizard also used Shadowwolves that resemble hyenas more than wolves.

None of the Ironspawn soldiers at Thornwall Keep speak with Aldric, or to anyone, in the film, as some do in the book.
