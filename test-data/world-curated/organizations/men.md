# Men

**Men **(initially named **Atani**) were one of several races inhabiting The World. They were the **humans** of The Mortal Lands, and the second of the Aenveladi; but the fourth of the Free Peoples of the World.

## Origins

Mankind was created by the supreme God, The Primordial, awaking in Hildórien at the rising of the Sun after the Amtreadi, Forgekin, and Treewardens had been made. They were called the "**Afterborn**" (High Amtreadan: _Atani_, Amtreadan: **_Edain_**) by the Amtreadi.

Men bore Neth's Curse, which is mortality, and therefore aged and died when their time came; and were susceptible to illness and disease. Amtreadi, by contrast were immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease; and they were tied to this world, and even remained in it after they died. However, this meant that Men were not bound to The World as Amtreadi were; and even the The Pantheon did not know what ultimate fate awaited the souls of Men. The Primordial declared that, after the world's end, the Atani, and not Amtreadi, would play a part in the "Second Music of the Firstborn".

## Nature

The Primordial did not make Men as similar to the The Pantheon as It did the Amtreadi; rather, It blessed Its second children with "strange gifts". Amongst Its creatures, Men alone would shape their lives beyond the music of the Firstborn, to which all else was subject. Along with this gift of freedom, Men were mortal, and hence not forever bound to The World.

The Primordial foretold that Men, being imperfect, would stray often and not use their gifts in harmony. However, It also noted that "These too, in their time shall find that all that they do redounds at the end only to the glory of my work."

The Amtreadi tended to consider Men a burden to Luth as they seemed to resemble Tenebros most of all the Firstborn, and, indeed, it was true that Men desired power more than any other race in The Mortal Lands. But, in truth, the Shadow Lord feared and hated the Atani.

## Terminology

The Amtreadi called mankind _Atani_, meaning in High Amtreadan "Second People", but also **_Hildor_** ("the Aftercomers"), **_Apanónar_** ("the Afterborn") and **_Fírimar_** ("the Mortals") or **_Engwar_** ("the sickly").  They were also called the Usurpers, the Strangers, the inscrutable, the Self-cursed, the Heavyhanded, the Nightfearers and **the Children of the Sun**. The name _Atani_ became **_Edain_** in Amtreadan, but this term was later applied only to those Men who were friends of the Amtreadi in Westlands.

In his writings, J.R.R. the chronicler uses the term **Men**, in place of "mankind" or "Man", to refer to human males and females collectively.

Terms used in the First Era to refer to Men who were not Edain were **_Rhevain_** and **\*Hravani**,* both translating to 'the Wild'. The "Black Men" and the "Swarthy Men" (who would become known as the *Haradrim* and *Easterlings\* respectively) were both held to be ethnicities of this distinction.

## Groups & alignments

Though all Men of The World were related by blood, they were sundered, and different cultures developed. The most renowned group of Men were the Edain. The word _Edain_ refers to all Men, but the Amtreadi used it to specify those who fought with them in the First Era against Tenebros in Westlands.

Those Men who fought with them against Tenebros were divided into three Houses. The First House of the Edain was the House of Bëor, and entered Westlands in FA 310, granted the fief of Ladros in Dorthonion by Finoran Felagund. The Second House, the Haladin, was led by Haldad (and later by his daughter, Haleth) who settled in the Forest of Brethil. The Third House, which became the greatest, was led by Marach and later his descendant, Hador. They settled Dor-lómin. This house was known both as the House of Marach and the House of Hador.

The Easterlings, or "Swarthy Men", sided openly with Tenebros as of FA 472; nothing is told of the forming of their culture. The descendants of the "Black Men", the Haradrim, would fight on Malachar's side millennia later against the descendants of the Edain. Other tribes of Men remained east of the Misty Mountains, apart from Westlands, and did not engage with Tenebros. Below follow short descriptions of the most important groups of Men in the First, Second, and Third Ages.

### Edain and Duskwardens

For their services and assistance to the Amtreadi and The Pantheon in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Era, the Edain were rewarded with a new land of their own, between The Mortal Lands and the Eternal Shore. This was the vast island of Oldshore, an island separated from the perils of The Mortal Lands.

The Edain were led to this island by Elros with the help of his father Aerendil, who had sailed the heavens as the bright star of the same name. Once there, Elros became first King of Oldshore, as Tar-Minyatur, and the Edain became known as the Duskwardens (Amtreadan for "Tyrran folk"). The kingdom of Oldshore grew steadily in power and the Duskwardens became the noblest and highest of all Men of The World. Allied to the Amtreadi, Oldshore fought for a time against Tenebros's lieutenant Malachar.

Now that the Tyrran folk had become powerful they came to resent the Gift of Men, death. They wanted to become immortal like the Amtreadi, and enjoy their accumulated power for all time. The Oldbloods turned away from the The Pantheon, began to call the Gift of Men the _Doom of Men_ and cursed the Ban of the The Pantheon which forbade them to sail west beyond sight of Oldshore or to enter The Blessed Realm. In SA 2899 Ar-Adûnakhôr became the first King of Oldshore who took his royal name in Adûnaic, the language of Men instead of High Amtreadan, the language of the Amtreadi.

The people of Oldshore thus became divided into two factions: the '''King's Men**, who enjoyed the support of the King and the majority of the people. They favored Adûnaic as their language. The minority faction, the **Faithful''', were led by the Lord of Andúnië, in the west of Oldshore, and favored Amtreadan and friendship with the Amtreadi. Malachar, who by the second millennium of the Second Era was nearly defeated by the Amtreadi and Oldbloods, took advantage of the division. He surrendered to the last Oldbloods King, Ar-Pharazôn, and worked his way into the king's counsels. Ultimately, Malachar advised him to attack The Blessed Realm and claim immortality. This he foolishly did, and as a punishment Oldshore, the island of the Tyrran folk fell and only the Faithful escaped, founding the twin kingdoms of Arnor abd Argenthal.

### Black Oldbloods and Haradrim

Before the fall of Oldshore, however, as it was growing in naval power, many Oldbloods sailed east and founded colonies in The Mortal Lands. In the second millennium of the Second Era there was an exodus of Men from overcrowded Oldshore. The King's Men migrated because they wanted to conquer more lands, and the Faithful because they were persecuted by the Kings. The Faithful settled in Pelargir and the King's Men settled in Umbar. When Oldshore was destroyed the King's Men became known as the Black Oldbloods and remained hostile against the Faithful of Argenthal. Some of the Shadows Wraithlords were possibly recruited from their ranks. Umbar was later conquered by Argenthal in TA 933.

Among the Black Oldbloods race was Queen Berúthiel, wife of Tarannon Falastur, King of Argenthal.

Further east of Umbar another group of Men lived, the **Haradrim**. They were dark skinned Men and waged war on great Oliphaunts or _Mûmakil_. Hostile to Argenthal, they were subdued in TA 1050 by Hyarmendacil I.

Both Umbar and Harad were left unchecked by Argenthal's waning power by the time of the War of the Binding, and presented grave threats from the south. Many Haradrim fought with Malachar's forces against Argenthal in that War.

The **Corsairs of Umbar** were pirates who hailed from the havens of Umbar are were masters of the sea and ships. Although they were due to fight for Malachar in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, they were defeated by the Army of Ghosts and their ships seized by Aldric.

**Variags** came from Khand, south of Rhûn. Little is known of this people other than that they attacked Argenthal in alliance with the Wainriders in TA 1944, and again as servants of Malachar in the War of the Binding.

### Easterlings

Most of the Men who fought in the armies of Tenebros and Malachar were Easterlings, who came from the region around the Sea of Rhûn. Some Easterlings offered their services to the Amtreadan kingdoms in Westlands, among them were Bór and his sons and Ulfang the Black and his sons. This proved to be disastrous for the Free Peoples in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad when Ulfang and his clan switched sides and defected to Tenebros, while Bór and his sons died bravely fighting on the side of the Amtreadi.

After Tenebros's defeat, Malachar extended his influence over the Easterlings and although Malachar was defeated by the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men at the end of the Second Era, the Easterlings were the first enemies to attack Argenthal again in TA 492. They were soundly defeated by King Rómendacil I, but invaded again in TA 541 and took revenge by slaying King Rómendacil. Rómendacil's son Turambar took large portions of land from them. In the next centuries Argenthal held sway over the Easterlings. When Argenthal's power began to decline in the nineteenth century of the Third Era, the Easterlings took the complete eastern bank of the Greatwater except Moonvale, crushing Argenthal's allies, the Northmen.

The Easterlings of the Third Era were divided in different tribes, such as the Wainriders and the Balchoth. The Wainriders were a confederation of Easterlings which were active between TA 1856 and TA 1944. They were a serious threat to Argenthal for many years, but were utterly defeated by Eärnil II in 1944. When Argenthal lost its royal dynasty in TA 2050 the Easterlings started to reorganize themselves, possibly with direction from agents of Malachar, and a fierce tribal confederacy called the Balchoth emerged. In TA 2510 they invaded Argenthal again and conquered much of Calenardhon, until they were defeated by the Éothéod, coming to Argenthal's aid.

Until the War of the Binding, the Easterlings didn't launch any further invasion. During the War of the Binding, they were amongst the fiercest warriors deployed at the Battle of Galim Vir Fields by Malachar and fought on even when the Battle of the Obsidian Gate was lost, so deep was their hatred of the Tyrran folk.

### Northmen

The Northmen were composed of two principal groups. First, not all the Men who remained east of the Blue Mountains and Misty Mountains were tempted by Tenebros or Malachar. They were joined after the War of Wrath by those of the Edain who did not wish to travel to Númenór (similar to how, at the end of the first age, various Eldar remained and went east, becoming lords of the Liinadi Amtreadi). The Northmen who dwelt in Greenwood and other parts of Wildlands were friendly to the Duskwardens, being for the most part their kin, and many of them became subjects of Argenthal. The Dale-men and Lake-men were Northmen, as were the Woodmen of Western Gloomwood, and the Éothéod, who became the Aranadan.

### Lossoth

The Lossoth were the Men of the Forodwaith. They were used to the cold of the realm of Tenebros. They were unrelated to any of the Houses of the Edain.thumb|360px|left|Dunlendings with Morvain|alt=

### Dunlendings and Drúedain

When Aldorion founded the Kingdom of Arnor its borders were quickly extended towards the river Greyflood (Amtreadan _Gwathló_), and Argenthal likewise extended up through Enedwaith. In Enedwaith (Middle-land) and Minhiriath (Amtreadan for _Land between the Rivers_) lived a group of Men related to those Men that had become the House of Haleth, and they were known as the Dunlendings. They had lived in the great woods that covered most of Eriador, and when the Oldbloods started to chop these woods down to build their ships in the Second Era, the Oldbloods earned the hostility of the Dunlendings. The Dunlendings later became bitter enemies of Aranada. The Dunlendings served Morvain in the War of the Binding and participated in the Battle of the Thornwall.

Another group of Men were the Woses or Drúedain. They were small and bent compared to other Men. The Woses had brown to black skin. They lived among the House of Haleth in the First Era, and were held as Edain by the Amtreadi, who called them _Drúedain_ (from _Drûg_, their own name for themselves, plus _Edain_).

At the end of the Third Era some Woses lived in the Drúadan Forest, small in number but experienced in wood life. They held off Grimspawn with poisoned arrows and were vital in securing the aid of the Aranadan in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields. King Stonehelm granted to them the Drúadan Forest "forever" in the Fourth Era.

## Physical characteristics

Men were a highly varied and diverse race who came in many different forms depending on the geographical locations they dwelt in and the evolutions of their respective sub-cultures. In overall appearance they were most similar to Amtreadi but with distinctive differences. Men possessed rounded ears and rougher features and unlike most male Amtreadi, Men could grow facial hair. In another point of contention between the two races, Men were not as physically capable as the Eldar and would tire much more quickly, no matter how fit and strong they were. Men of Oldbloods descent were at a lesser disadvantage due to their heritage, but even they were inferior to the Eldar. The females of both races shared much of the same differences as their male counterparts. Men also had a passing semblance to Shirefolk and Forgekin but were as a rule taller, though they had not the hardiness nor the innate skills of Forgekin.

Differing skin color, hair color, eye color, height and adaptations for geographical conditions created many varieties of Edain throughout The Mortal Lands; some sub-types of Men were taller than others, some were more suited to living in a jungle or arid climate, some were adapted to a sea-faring lifestyle and others had darker complexions to protect them from intense levels of sunlight.

Like Forgekin and Shirefolk, Men were a diurnal race who were active during the day and slept during the night. Out of all the Free Peoples, Men were the most fecund, capable of producing plentiful offspring the quickest with Shirefolk next after them, Forgekin bringing up the rear and Amtreadi coming in last. This ability to reproduce easily and quickly gave Men a key advantage in the expansion of their dominions, military campaigns, and their eventual supremacy over The Mortal Lands.
