The company was created by King Stonehelm in to settle the complex case of Beregond, as he had abandoned his post and spilled blood, yet saved Aldwin from an early death upon doing so. Stonehelm exiled Beregond from Galim Vir, but appointed him to be the first **Captain of the Guard** of Prince Aldwin to dwell within the hills of Emyn Arnen in sight of Galim Vir.

During the early Fourth Era, Borlas and two old servants retired to Pen-arduin from the '''Prince's guard\*\*.
