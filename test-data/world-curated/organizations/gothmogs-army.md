# Gorthak's army

An **army commanded by Gorthak** was responsible for the destruction of the hidden Amtreadi city of Hidden City, and for most of the victories of Tenebros in the First Era.

## History

This army was assembled in FA 510 after Maeglin's betrayal under the leadership of Gorthak. The army appeared to be the most advanced in technology compared to the rest of the *Glamhoth*. It was made up of Grimspawn, Stonelurks, Werewolves, Dragons, and Flamefiends. They surrounded the city of Hidden City and besieged it killing nearly all in an immense battle, save for the few that followed Tuor and Idril. Gorthak, however, was slain in this conflict by Ecthelion of the Fountain.

## Weaponcraft
In older versions of the legendarium, they used iron machines fueled by "internal fire" as personnel carriers and to destroy fortifications.
