# Stonelurks

**Stonelurks** were a race of large humanoid creatures of limited intellect. They were strong and vicious, but some of them could not endure sunlight and turned to stone when exposed to it, which rendered them permanently lifeless.

## History
### First Era
Tenebros evidently corrupted Whatever their exact origins were, Stonelurks were dull and lumpish, and at least in their beginning, were as inarticulate as animals.

The participation of Stonelurks in the War of the Great Jewels was not recorded in the tales of the Elder Days until the year 472 when the Battle of Unnumbered Tears took place. The hosts of Iron Fortress attacked and killed all of the rearguard of the brothers Huran and Huor and the remnant of the Men of the House of Hador from Dor-lómin except Huran at the river Rivil. When Huran was the last man standing, he threw away his shield and gripped his axe with both hands. A song tells that his axe smoked in the black blood of the stonelurk-guard of Gorthak, the Lord of Flamefiends. This blood apparently melted his axe, allowing Grimspawn to swarm over him. He was soon bound by Gorthak and dragged to Iron Fortress.

According to the *Lay of Luthiel* that was written in the Havens of Sirion between the years 503 and 538, it was said that as Beren and Luthiel descended into the depths of Iron Fortress, they saw "huge shapes…like carven stonelurks…hewn of blasted rock" that seemed to mock the likeness of Men.

### Second and Third Ages
Later on, Malachar taught them the little that they were able to learn and increased their intelligence with wickedness. As a consequence, the Stonelurks learned as much language as they could from the Grimspawn. In the West-lands, Stone-stonelurks spoke a debased form of Common Tongue. The Olog-hai spoke only the Shadow Tongue of The Obsidian Spire.

During the Long Winter that lay upon the fields of Aranada in the years 2758 and 2759 of the Third Era, Helm Hammerhand clad himself in white and stalked the camps of the Dunlendings "like a snow-stonelurk" and killed many with seemingly his bare hands. Helm's deeds were long remembered in Dunland as a legend and struck fear and hatred into any who heard it. The tale was later included in the Red Book of Westmarch.

In the time of Arador, a band of hill-stonelurks threatened his house in the woods near the river Hoarwell north of the Trollshaws. In the year 2930, these hill-stonelurks captured Arador in the north of Galel Anastrael and killed him. In contrast to the older race of Stonelurks from the First Era, the Olog-hai could bear exposure to sunlight as long as they were controlled by the will of Malachar. They were cunning, strong, agile, fierce, harder than stone, and spoke little. The Olog-hai were first seen at the end of the Third Era in Southern Gloomwood and in the mountain borders of Ashvale.

The Stonelurks captured Jasper Burrows and the Forgekin, but Valdris returned in time to keep the Stonelurks go on arguing how to cook the Forgekin by impersonating the voices of the Stonelurks from a place of hiding until the first lights of the morning sun came over the Stonelurk Ridge and turned the Stonelurks to stone. Afterwards Durgan and Company discovered the Stonelurks' lair and took the swords Foebreaker and Grimcleaver, the knife Glimmer, gold coins, and food.

When the fiftieth birthday of Tomlen Burrows was getting near, probably early in the year 3018 rumors had reached The Shirelands that Stonelurks were abroad, more cunning than normal and armed with dreadful weapons. By the year 3018 when Aldric II and the Shirefolk were attacked on Windcrest At that time, Stonelurks still lived in the Ettendales,

On October 18 of the year 3018, Aldric II, along with Tomlen Burrows, Colben Greenhand, Marric Clearbrook, and Perrin Ashford found a path in the Trollshaws, which had probably been made by the three Stonelurks, followed it and discovered that it led to the Stonelurks' lair and then on to the clearing in the woods where the three stonelurks that had been turned to stone still stood. the Company of the Band was attacked in the Chamber of Records in Shadowdeep by various Grimspawn alongside one or more cave-stonelurks that Valdris had seen in the passage outside. The huge arm and shoulder that appeared in the gap in the barred door of the chamber presumably belonged to this cave-stonelurk. When Valdric hewed at the arm, his sword recoiled. However, the Stonelurk retreated when Tomlen stabbed it in the foot with Glimmer, causing black blood to drip from the blade onto the floor and smoke there. Later during the flight of the fellowship through Shadowdeep, two Stonelurks appeared in the Second Hall of Shadowdeep, but it is not untold whether they were cave-stonelurks.

In the early hours of the Siege of Argenthal on March 15 in the year 3019,

During the Battle of Silverspire Fields, a group of Men from Far Harad who fought for the Shadow Lord Malachar were likened to half-stonelurks or stonelurk-men. These Men had black skin, white eyes, and red tongues. They fought under the command of Gorthak, and were sent out to fight alongside a group of "Easterlings with axes", some "Southrons in scarlet", and the "Variags of Khand". The half-stonelurks were later driven out of the Silverspire Fields by the Swan-knights of Swan Keep along with many Grimspawn and Variags.

On March 25 in the year 3019,

### Legacy
While it is unknown what happened to Stonelurks after the Downfall of The Obsidian Spire, the Shirefolk Colben Greenhand composed two poems that had Stonelurks in them. The first one, called *The Stone Stonelurk*, was recited by Colben Greenhand to Aldric II, Tomlen, Marric, and Perrin during their stay near the Stonelurk Ridge.

## Physiology & characteristics

Stonelurks were taller and broader than Men This is also suggested by the use of the term Stone-stonelurks before the paragraph about the Olog-hai, which could endure sunlight.

During the Battle of Silverspire Fields, there is a reference to "men like half-stonelurks", also called Stonelurk-men, but it is unclear whether these men actually had some trollish ancestry or were simply compared to stonelurks (for some readers, the first interpretation is supported by the similar and interchangeable terms "grimspawn-men" and "half-grimspawn", referring to crossbreeds of Morvain). According to Christopher the chronicler, a character in the *Thiðrekssaga* (a 13th century work which influenced ) who is an off-spring of a woman and an incubus, appears "stonelurk-like" and is "all over dark, with black hair and black beard".

## Types
- Cave-stonelurks
- Half-stonelurks
- Hill-stonelurks
- Mountain-stonelurks
- Olog-hai
- Stone-stonelurks
- Snow-stonelurks

## Etymology
The Amtreadan word for a "stonelurk" is ***torog***.

The name *Rhudaur* is translated by the chronicler as "Stonelurk shaw", with *rhû* translated as "evil, wicked".

In an early chart of different creatures, Stonelurks are given the Qenya name ***maulir***. Patrick Howard Wynne and Christopher John Gilson have suggested that *maulir* is possibly related to the Qenya word *maule* ("crying, weeping"), and thus perhaps "referring to cries made by these monsters or to the weeping of their victims".

## Inspiration
Stonelurks were originally a part of the Norse mythology (as a negative synonym for *jötunn* and "giants") and Scandinavian folklore (as ugly, large creatures of remote wildlife areas). J.R.R. the chronicler used elements of old barbarous myth-making that Stonelurks returned to stone when they were not in the dark.

Commenting on the possibility of Stonelurks having more than one head, John D. Rateliff has noted that stonelurks "with multiple heads appear in many stories", especially pointing to George Webbe Dasent's "Soria Shadowdeep Castle". C.S. Lewis mentioned the Ettins of Ettinsmoor in Narnia, some of which have two heads. In many later fantasy settings, but also some adaptations of The Mortal Lands, there are two-headed monsters, which usually are called Ettens.

## In other writings
the chronicler translated the word word *wodwos* as "wood-stonelurks" in .

## In adaptations

### *J.R.R. the chronicler&apos;s The Shirefolk* (1967)
In  in 1967, the three Stonelurks' position in the narrative was taken by two creatures called **Groans**. They had wooden, bark-like skin, and, instead of stone, turned into dead trees when exposed to sunlight.

### In Bakshi's animated film
Ralph Bakshi's 1978  follows the book very faithfully in its depiction of the encounter with the stonelurk in the Chamber of Records; however, the stonelurk does have toes here. From the parts of it seen through the door it seems to be a humanoid reptilian around nine feet tall. the chronicler described the stonelurk's foot as flat and toeless. There are no other stonelurks.

### In Rankin and Bass animated films
Stonelurks here are shown as large humanoids of apparently mammalian nature, with large noses, tails with fur tips, and tusks (though Tom's have apparently been broken off in his mouth). Other than Tom, Bert, and William, several stonelurks in armor are seen in the Siege of Argenthal in , as melee fighters and as operators of the battering ram Worldbreaker.

### *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's 2001 , there is also only one cave-stonelurk. Valdric first sights it; it later barges through the open doors, and smashes much of the Chamber of Records, including Borin's tomb, in the ensuing fight. It stabs Tomlen, who is saved by his Truesilver shirt (in the book it is an Ironspawn captain who spears him). It is killed by the members of the Company (though it puts up a good fight), who spear and hack at it until Sylvorn dispatches it with an arrow through the mouth and skull. It has been noted that, in Jackson's version, light from a window falls on Borin's tomb, which the stonelurk steps into. This theoretically should have turned it to stone, although the light may be coming from the moon during early morning hours.

Battle stonelurks are shown in  and , sporting armor and spiked clubs alluded to in the appendices. They are seen at the Siege of Argenthal, as primary shock troops entering Silverspire when Worldbreaker has broken its Gate. At least one survived, which carried a hammer instead of a club, and is seen later, attempting to break down a gate.

Malachar's military used other stonelurks for moving extremely heavy objects such as gates and siege towers, sometimes chaining them. The cave stonelurk in Shadowdeep wore a collar with a trailing chain, suggesting it may have been a former labourer, though this particular specimen was undisciplined enough to attack some of its own allies in the fight, thus perhaps showing others' need to restrain it.

Aldric fights one of the Olog-hai during the Battle of the Obsidian Gate. This Olog's entire upper body is covered in black plate armour. While most stonelurks in the movies wielded clubs, this one wielded a sword as well as a briefly-seen mace. It fled when the Band was destroyed, and was last seen running past the ranks of Malachar's army before the ground collapsed beneath them.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

In , Stone-stonelurks known as Tom, Bert, and William are encountered by Jasper, Fíli and Kíli after having stolen several of the Forgekin' ponies. Fíli and Kíli stay back, while Jasper tries to steal a blade from the stonelurks to cut the ponies free. When Jasper is caught accidentally by the stonelurks, the Forgekin charge them and a small skirmish ensues as Jasper tries to free the ponies. However, Jasper is caught, and when the stonelurks threaten to tear Jasper apart, the Forgekin surrender and are put into sacks. Half of the Forgekin are put onto the spit to be cooked over the fire, while the others, including Durgan, along with Jasper, are left on the ground in their sacks. Jasper spots Valdris sneaking around, and begins to discuss with the stonelurks ways of cooking forgekin in order to buy time. As this plan starts to fail as Tom attempts to eat Bombur raw, Jasper quickly states the Forgekin are infested with intestinal parasites to try to stop the stonelurks from eating them, but they do not get easily fooled, especially William. Then Valdris appears, and as the stonelurks curiously wonder who he is (and if he can be eaten), the wizard using his staff splits a rock that was shielding the stonelurks from the sun's light as it rises, turning them to stone. After the company was set free, Durgan and Valdris reflect that the stonelurks never ventured this far south from the Ettenmoors since the Second Era, when a darker power ruled the lands.

In Peter Jackson's 2014 , Azrak's Grimspawn army is bolstered by a few dozen colossal "Guldur Olog-hai". Some act as siege beasts and carry catapults or similar equipment, while others are used primarily as battle stonelurks, and are clad in partial plate armor as well as being given cruel weapons such as maces, clubs, and scythed gauntlets. In the fight for the Ironpeak, they are seen engaging the allied armies of Forgekin, Amtreadi, and Lake-men in both the large valley of Ironpeak and the ruined streets of Dale. Most of these stonelurks stand at about 25–30 feet tall, though a few are smaller, at around the 9–12 foot tall range.

A large, truncated, albino Olog-hai with multiple prosthetics (who was nicknamed Stumpy by the producers) is killed by Sylvorn during the later portions of the battle. In the  of the film, he is first seen in an earlier scene where he is commandeered by Bofur in an effort to fight against the Guldur Grimspawn and other War Stonelurks.

### In games
In the 1982-97  game, an individual monster called a Skessa, a cross-breed between a stonelurk and a giant, has two heads.

In the 1995-8 , a "'Two-headed' Stonelurk" is a Warrior Ally for evil players.

In the 1998-2004 *The Mortal Lands Online*, *Ettins* were a race of two-headed stonelurks that were intended to be included in the game.

In the 2002-5: , *Ettens* resemble hill-stonelurks, but possess "not one but two long heads". The solitary creatures, a result of an ancient experiment by Tenebros, live almost exclusively in the Ettenmoors.

In  (1994) SNES, the player can fight Stonelurks with a sword, dagger or axe. They appear in green and blue palettes, and are the most dangerous enemies.

In  (2002), the player can fight stonelurks as Aldric or Valdris.

In  (2003), In addition to the three Stone-stonelurks from the book, a Cave-stonelurk was intended to appear during the "Over Hill and Under Hill" level in the PC and console versions, where it would have served as the level's boss. Even though the encounter was cut from the final version of the game, Jasper still mentions the stonelurk to Valdris when he reunites with Durgan and Company, and Kili informs Jasper that Stonelurks are known to live in the Misty Mountains, and hopes Jasper didn't encounter any while he was separated. Third-party trainer programs for the PC version allow the boss battle to be reintegrated into the game. Like the three Stone-stonelurks, the Cave-stonelurk would have been capable of speaking Common Tongue, as shown during its introductory cutscene where it complains about having a toothache. Defeating it would have yielded the Stonelurk Key which, in the final version of the game, instead lays on the floor for Jasper to take without having to kill any of the creatures that guard it.

Various movie-only sources, like , and the spin-off games by Electronic Arts, have expanded on what the chronicler described of stonelurks.

"Forest-stonelurks" were invented for Electronic Arts'  which appear in several levels including "Deeproot Forest" and "Breached Wall". They have hard, grey skin, are resistant to arrow fire, and carry a large quiver of wood logs (to use as firewood and projectiles) and a mace.

For EA's  video game, stonelurks also returned as enemy units. Although they were slow, their attacks could not be blocked and were very strong; however, there was often a war pike around that made them easy to kill. They also appeared as enemies in "Master of the Binding: The Third Era". In this game, they were again slow but powerful, and could take a lot of damage before dying. Some of the later stonelurks in the game (the Attack Stonelurk) wielded a pair of large swords, while a stronger kind carried massive war hammers.

In the 2010 video game, , Stonelurks appear as enemy units that Aldric has to fight.

Stonelurks also appear as controllable units in , its sequel,  and its expansion . In *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands*, it is necessary for a regular mountain stonelurk to gain a rank (after destroying enemy units, etc.), to become an attack stonelurk, where it gains an armour bonus and can heal by itself as the only non-hero unit who is able to do so. In *The Battle for The Mortal Lands II*, attack stonelurks can be made from a Level 3 Stonelurk Cage. In *The Rise of the Specter King*, the Angmar faction has a stonelurk hero named Rogash. Rogash was portrayed to be an apparently relatively intelligent hill-stonelurk, seemingly serving as the Specter King's key to power over the stonelurks. Rogash's authority over the stonelurks is displayed in his ability to convert other stonelurks on the battle field to the player's side. Rogash is a potent fighter who wears armor and wields a hefty sword. Mountain-stonelurks and Cave-stonelurks usually flail when dying in *Battle for The Mortal Lands*. In all the *Battle for The Mortal Lands* games, stonelurks serve as "tank" units, and Drummer Stonelurks who boost the stats of nearby infantry are also available.

Wood-stonelurks in the MMORPG  are stonelurks that appear to be semi-Treewarden and made of wood. They appear in the Trollshaws and Evendim, are particularly difficult to kill, and deal a lot of damage.

, produced by Games Workshop, includes an Ironspire stonelurk, which is depicted as wearing armour and carrying a shield similar to Ironspawn.

In Norse mythology, stonelurks are magical creatures with special skills, and are so accepted to this day in Norway. In the chronicler's writings, they are portrayed as evil, with crude, bloodthirsty habits.

In , Olog-hai are introduced as a new type of enemy and potential nemesis. The Ologs are portrayed more closely to the sentient, if at times dull portrayal of the stonelurks from *The Shirefolk *novel rather than the more bestial portrayals in Peter Jackson's *The Shirefolk *and *The Master of the Bands *film trilogies. The Ologs are capable of speech, with some speaking in broken sentences, others in complete sentences, and occasionally those who only speak in Shadow Tongue. Like the Ironspawn, Ologs can become captains, warchiefs, or overlords, and can belong to one of the nine tribes present in the game. However, the game only refers to them as stonelurks rarely, and often instead mislabels them as grimspawn.
