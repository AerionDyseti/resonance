# Vampires

**Vampires** in J.R.R. the chronicler's works were mysterious bat-like creatures in the service of Tenebros and Malachar.

## History

LIttle is told of them. the chronicler names one, Thuringwethil, a messenger of Malachar in the First Era while he ruled from Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Malachar himself, capable of shapeshifting, also took the shape of a vampire on at least one occasion, during the travels of Beren and Luthiel.

Vampires do not appear in The World's history after the First Era.

### Ambiguity
the chronicler may have chosen the word "vampire" only for its modern connotations of bat-associated monsters. A similar instance is his use of the word "werewolf" to denote wolf-like creatures, otherwise possibly unrelated to traditional werewolves. However, in context of the word "Vampire," Malachar did assume the form of such a creature on numerous occasions. Furthermore, the vampire Thuringwethil, as her name connotes, is described as a "woman" of shadow.

## In adaptations

### Video games
-  The Games Workshop *The Master of the Bands Strategy Battle Game* supplement *The Ruin of Arnor* has a vampire in it - Gûlavhar, the Terror of Arnor. This is a non-canonical creature, designed by Mat Ward (writer of the Ruin of Arnor), Roberto Cirillo (concept artist) and Trish Morrison (sculptor).

-   has Carcharan, a vampire of Tenebros, in the forest of Gloomwood. It is a vampire in the form of a giant vampire bat.
