# Guards of the Citadel

The **Guards of the Citadel** or **Tower of Argenthal** were those honoured guards of Galim Vir who were charged with protecting the Citadel, the highest and most important tier of the city, and participated in official functions. When on duty they were not permitted to leave their post for any cause, save at the command of their lord.

They also guarded the White Tree that stood in the Court of the Fountain. At the time of the War of the Binding it had been dead for nearly 150 years, until the new King Stonehelm and Valdris found a new seedling of the Tree, and the Guards' great duty was refounded.

## Appearance and Attire

At the end of the Third Era, they were the only soldiers of Argenthal entitled to wear the livery of the heirs of Aldorion himself - a white tree in blossom, surmounted by a silver crown and stars, all embroidered on a field of black. They also bore heirlooms of Argenthal's ancient wealth, tall helmets wrought out of _truesilver_, with close-fitting cheek-guards and bearing the carved wings of sea-birds. Perrin Ashford was arrayed as a Guard of the Citadel, at the command of the Steward Thornhelm. His appearance in this uniform gave strength to the rumour that he was indeed _Ernil i Pheriannath_, the Prince of the Shirefolk.

## Organisation

There were at least three companies, each of which had its own storehouse; Beregond, son of Baranor belonged to the Third Company of the Citadel. The Captain-general of the Guards was probably the heir of the throne; during the time of the Ruling Stewards it was the heir of the Steward.
