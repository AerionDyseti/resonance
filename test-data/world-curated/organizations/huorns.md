# Huorns

**Huorns** were large and wild tree-like creatures which could move and use speech, whom the Treewardens cared for and tended to in the Second and Third Ages. They were a half "awoken" race, being more sapient than trees, but not fully sentient like Treewardens.

In The Mortal Lands, they were known to dwell in Deeproot Forest and possibly the Old Forest.

## History

The origin of the Huorns is unknown. It is not clear if Huorns were Treewardens that had become tree-like, or trees that had become Treewarden. Perhaps both varieties existed, though the Shirefolk Marric Clearbrook believed the former was true. In either case, Huorns were probably a transitional creature part way between trees and Treewardens.

In the Third Era, the Huorns lived in Deeproot Forest, After Ironspire was emptied of its Grimspawn, the Treewardens directed the Huorns to help the Aranadan at the Thornwall in their battle. While at Thornwall Keep, the Huorns defeated every one of the Grimspawn fleeing the battle. Afterwards, they then gathered all the Grimspawn carcasses and buried them in the Death Down before going back into the forests. It is likely comprised of the elements *hū* ("spirit, shadow") and *orn* ("a tall tree"). It may also be related to the root *KHUG* ("bark, bay"). Carl F. Hostetter also suggested that it means "talking tree" in High Amtreadan, assuming that it is related to the root *KHOL* ("crow, cry aloud"). Mark Fisher theorized that the word is connected to *hûr* ("active") and *hû* ("dog").
