Type: Religious
Influence: Universal
Relationship to Party: Neutral

The **Pantheon of Creation** is one of three patron pantheons that shaped the mortal races of Enym. Drawing inspiration from **Atheros**, the Trinity member representing Creation, these gods embody the principles of life, growth, and freedom.

## Member Deities

- **Ehlonna (The Hearth-Keeper)** - Patron of Shirefolk
- **Corus (The Wind-Caller)** - Patron of Raptorans
- **Shir'rasha (The Far-Wanderer)** - Patron of Tabaxi and Gnomes
- **Olm (The Formless)** - Patron of Changelings

## Divine Philosophy

The pantheon represents life, growth, freedom, and creative force - channeling Atheros's legacy of bringing forth beneficial life.
