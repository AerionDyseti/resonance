# Host of the West

The **Host of the West** was the great army prepared by the Lords of Argenthal and Aranada to march on the Obsidian Gate, after the Battle of Galim Vir Fields in the late Third Era.

## History

Two days after the council of the Last Debate (March 16, TA 3019), a force of 7,000 men left Galim Vir. Under Aldric were 2,000 of those who sailed with him up the Greatwater; under Imrahil were 3,500 (probably from among the original defenders of the city); under Horsehelm were 500 Aranadan unhorsed, and another 500 horsed; and lastly another 500 horsed swan-knights, Wardens of the North, and the two sons of Thalion: 6,000 men on foot and about 1,000 on horse.

When the host reached the Cross-roads of the Fallen King, the captains stationed a strong force of archers there, to guard against any attack from the East or South.

The host came to the Specter Vale on the next day. On March 23 the Army exited Moonvale and along the way some 1,000 faint-hearted men who would not approach the Obsidian Gate were dismissed and commanded to liberate River Keep. Finally the next day they camped in the Desolation of the Obsidian Gate.

At the Slag-hills they were surrounded, and fought the Battle of the Obsidian Gate with less than 6,000 men total, but because of the destruction of the Binding Band, they were able to achieve a very decisive victory. It is untold how many were slain; it was apparently a few.

After the battle Aldric led a force into Ashvale to destroy the remaining Grim-holds whilst the wounded, including the Band-bearers were sent to the Field of Cormallen, where a celebration was held. After this the army returned to Galim Vir for the Crowning of King Stonehelm and then disbanded.
