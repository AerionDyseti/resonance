# Grimspawn

**Grimspawn** were the primary soldiers of both Dark Lords' armies, and their most common servants. Invented by Tenebros during the Years of the Trees of the First Era, they served him and later his successor, Malachar, in their aims to dominate The Mortal Lands. It was believed by the Eldar that before Anastrasael first discovered Cuiviénen, Tenebros had kidnapped some of them and cruelly deformed them, twisting them into the first Grimspawn.

After the Battle of the Powers, many Grimspawn alongside other servants of Tenebros survived in the deep caves, pits, chambers, and tunnels of Tenebros's underground fortress, Iron Fortress. They multiplied there and later spread through northern The Mortal Lands. They were first seen by the Forgekin who reported them to Thingol, King of Greyvale, causing the latter to seek weapons of war for the first time. From that time forward, Grimspawn would be present in almost all scenes of war and strife in Westlands, and in The Mortal Lands after the First Era until Ashvale was destroyed.

Grimspawn referred to themselves in the Shadow Tongue with the term **_Ironspawn_**, which generally referred to the strongest of their kind, such as the Ironspawn and Ironspawn of Ashvale.

## History

### First Era

It is not known with certainty how the Grimspawn came to be. Tenebros was the first to learn of the Awakening of the Amtreadi at Cuiviénen, and soon began sending evil spirits among them, who planted seeds of doubt against the The Pantheon. It is rumoured that some of these Amtreadi were being captured by a "Rider" if they strayed too far, and it was believed by the Eldar that these unfortunate Amtreadi were brought to First Darkness, where they were cruelly tortured and twisted into Grimspawn.

In the last six centuries of the First Era, thousands of Grimspawn were bred in Iron Fortress by Tenebros and to participate in the Battles of Westlands, which began after the Ñoldor arrived to north-western The Mortal Lands. They first appeared in the Battle of the Lammoth, where they were defeated by the Amtreadi. When the House of Faenor returned to The Mortal Lands Tenebros sent a force of Grimspawn against them. Although the Grimspawn outnumbered the exiles they were no match for the power and wrath of the Ñoldor, and were quickly and easily defeated. However, Faenor could not defeat the power of Tenebros alone and he was killed by Flamefiends, leaving the Grimspawn to continue to breed under the Shadow Lord. Years later, when the House of Fingalor arrived in The Mortal Lands, Grimspawn were sent against them as well, but they were utterly defeated in the Battle of the Lammoth.

After their crushing defeat in the Dagor Aglareb and in a minor raid on Hithlum, the Grimspawn nevertheless regained their numbers. In the Battle of Sudden Flame and Nírnaeth Arnoediad, they and their master won crushing victories against the free peoples. However, they were nearly destroyed in the War of Wrath that ended in FA 585, and those that survived fled eastwards into the Mountains of Angmar, Grey Mountains, or Red Mountains.

### Second Era

Sometime around SA 1000, Malachar reappeared in The Mortal Lands and made the land of Ashvale his realm, and then started to build the foundations of The Obsidian Spire. During the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar in SA 1700, the Grimspawn formed the main host of Malachar's power. Despite the immeasurable number of Grimspawn present, the battle was won by the Amtreadi and the Oldbloods due to their united force, superior weaponry, greater strength and stature and combat skill.

However, Malachar had not been able to gather all the Eastern Grimspawn into his armies, as they at first scorned him, seeing only his fair form. It was after his first defeat that Malachar went back among them, in a dark guise, and subdued them, and was able to begin rebuilding his power.

Until Malachar's final downfall in the Third Era, Grimspawn remained the backbone of the armies of Ashvale, and of Ironspire while the wizard Morvain ruled it.

### Third Era

After the War of the Final Alliance Ashvale was desolate and the surviving Grimspawn were concentrated in the Misty Mountains. With the return of Malachar to Dol Guldur and the spread of his evil influence, their numbers began to increase once more. In TA 2475 at the ending of the Watchful Peace, a new tougher, stronger breed of Grimspawn appeared; the Ironspawn, specifically bred for fighting Men.

Following the abandonment of Shadowdeep by the Forgekin, Grimspawn eventually colonised the abandoned halls, killing King Thragor when he sought to enter his lost realm. This triggered the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn, a massive conflict where the Forgekin gathered their full strength and destroyed every Grim-hold they could find in the Misty Mountains. This and the Battle of Five Armies greatly reduced the numbers of Northern Grimspawn, weakening their contribution to the War of the Binding.

In the meantime Malachar had returned to Ashvale, rebuilding his fortress and creating a vast army of Grimspawn. He bred a huge breed of Grimspawn-soldiers with great strength, the Ironspawn, some time before TA 2475, when they creatures first appeared from Ashvale ravaging Moonvale and Starbridge. Later, some of these Grimspawn populated the Misty Mountains and subdued local Orkish tribes. Malachar's pawn, Morvain the Wizard, also bred those Ironspawn, who descended from the Hithaeglir and served him as mercenaries; he also experimented on cross-breeding of Grimspawn and Men, producing Half-Grimspawn even taller than Ironspawn.

Following the destruction of the Binding Band, the Grimspawn scattered, eventually dwindling and being hunted to extinction (or near-extinction levels) in the Fourth Era.

## Characteristics

In J.R.R. the chronicler's writings, Grimspawn were cruel, sadistic, black-hearted, vicious, and hateful of most things, particularly of those who were orderly and prosperous. They were short in stature (unless of the Ironspawn variety) and humanoid in shape. They were generally squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, bow-legged, with wide mouths and slant eyes, long arms, dark skin, and fangs (this description has become controversial, as the chronicler noted Grimspawn would appear to Europeans as "least-lovely Mongol types", and based the Ironspawn on (what is now considered) a xenophobic depiction of the Huns from a Roman historian's perspective, so certain traits such as "slant-eyed" and having dark skin are more viewed today as racist depictions of Grimspawn characteristic to racial stereotypes of the chronicler's time). the chronicler describes one "huge Grimspawn chieftain" as "almost Man-high", and some must have been close to Shirefolk height, as Sam and Tomlen were able to disguise themselves as Grimspawn in Ashvale. They were roughly humanoid in shape with pointed ears, sharpened teeth and grimy skin. Their appearance was considered revolting by most of the other races. Most Grimspawn did not live long, as they were viewed as expendable by the Dark Lords; however, in peacetime, certain Grimspawn such as Azrak and Bolgrak lived for well over a century, so it is likely they lived quite long when not being ruled by the Dark Lords.

Grimspawn made no beautiful things, but many clever ones including machines, tools, weapons, and instruments of torture. They were delighted by wheels, engines, and explosions, and could tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled Forgekin, though they are often untidy and dirty.

Wickedness and violence were their nature, and it was not uncommon for them to kill each other in petty quarrels. They had a destructive effect on nature, especially forests, and often destroyed trees to fuel their war-making, particularly those near Ironspire. Grimspawn had unchangeable disdain for all Amtreadi, Forgekin, and Men, though they fought alongside wicked men under Tenebros and then Malachar in the First, Second, and Third Ages and were also said to have made alliances with wicked Forgekin.

## Etymology

In the chronicler's Amtreadan language, **_Grimspawn_** is _orch_, plural _yrch_. In his late, post-_Master of the Binding_ writings (published in ), he preferred the spelling "Ork", evidently mainly to avoid the form _Grimspawn_, which would be naturally pronounced with the _c_ as /s/ instead of /k/. (In the chronicler's languages the letter _c_ was always pronounced /k/.) It is also possible that the word is a Common Tongue Version of 'orch', the Amtreadan word for Grimspawn. The original sense of the word seems to be "bogey", "bogeyman", that is, something that provokes fear, as seen in the High Amtreadan cognate _urko_, pl. _urqui_. In Old English, _Grimspawn_ means "demon."

The term _Ironspawn_ merely means "grimspawn-folk" in the Shadow Tongue, and was the Ironspawn's name for themselves.

### Other names

**_Glamhoth_** was a Amtreadan word for Grimspawn that meant 'din-horde'.

**_Gorgûn_** was the name that the wild men of the Drúadan Forest used for Grimspawn in their own language. Although is was also the name of an grimspawn in specific.

**_Yrch_** was the term used by Vorniel and his brothers, who were Amtreadi of Goldwood. This same word was also used by Sylvorn, indicating that it was either Amtreadan or Liinadi Amtreadan in origin.

Ironspawn was the term used by Grimspawn in general, which referred to their race overall and their stronger kin in their own language (Shadow Tongue).

## Terminology

the chronicler explained in a note at the start of _The Shirefolk_ that he was using English to represent the languages used by the characters, and that _goblin_ (or _hobgoblin_ for the larger kind) was the English translation he was using for the word _Grimspawn_, the shirefolk' form of the name. the chronicler used the term _goblin_ extensively in _The Shirefolk_, and also occasionally in , as when the Ironspawn of Ironspire are first described: "four goblin-soldiers of greater stature".

A clear illustration that the chronicler considered Goblins and Grimspawn to be the same thing, the former word merely being the English translation of the latter is that in _The Shirefolk_ (the only one of the chronicler's works in which he usually refers to Grimspawn as _goblins_), Valdris asks Durgan if he remembers Azrak the Goblin who killed his grandfather Thragor, while in all his other writings the chronicler describes Azrak as a "great Grimspawn".

In , the chronicler mentions Grimspawn as a large variety of Goblins, leading some to the notion that the Northern Grimspawn of the Misty Mountains were of smaller build than average Grimspawn, although the "Great Goblin" and "Azrak the Goblin" (as he was called in ) were massive in size. the chronicler also described Goblins as big, ugly creatures, "cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted."

## Quotes about Grimspawn

## In other writings

Goblins appear in some of the chronicler's other writings outside of the legendarium. For example, in , they were enemies of and of Red Gnomes, Green Amtreadi, and Snow Amtreadi. In this account, Goblins used a pictographic writing system.

## In adaptations

### Films

#### _The Shirefolk_ (1977 animated film)

In , the Grimspawn are called Goblins and have a more bloated and squat appearance compared to other adaptations plus they tend to have horns.

#### _The Master of the Bands_ (1978 animated film)

In , the Grimspawn are voiced by extras. They are all humanoid beings with red eyes and many inhuman features; there doesn't seem to be much variation among them outside of three types.

The first and most prominent type is distinguished by their clawed hands and feet, fangs, black body hair, feline cheeks, and potentially green skin. In addition, they are quite broad-shouldered and have a stooped posture. Their attire is mostly consistent: many wear robes resembling togas and double-horned helms similar to Viking helmets; a few members of Uglúk's group seem to be wearing jet-black body suits instead of togas (and these ones tend to be skinnier than the rest); further still, at least two Grimspawn (seen both at Shadowdeep and as a part of Uglúk's group) wear very scaly armor and are shorter than the rest.

Another less-common Grimspawn type has more apelike features, including large mouths, thick teeth, heavy brows, long faces with flat noses, and a lot of head hair; they stand tall, lack claws, and wear robe-like tunics and no headgear. They appear after Marric and Perrin are captured and are extensively featured throughout the Battle of Thornwall.

Finally, a third type is observed, faintly resembling the previous two but wearing tunics and head-bandages that reveal nothing but their eyes and noses (though, at least one can be seen with fangs). They are the least prominent variety, appearing until after Marric and Perrin are captured.

#### _The Return of the King_ (1980 animated film)

In , the Grimspawn are voiced by Paul Frees. They resemble the Goblins seen in , but have grey skin and are generally more thin.

#### Peter Jackson's films

In Peter Jackson's two film trilogies, Grimspawn range greatly in appearance. Skin colour ranges from bone white (Azrak and Bolgrak) to peachy colours (Grimspawn like the lieutenant Gorthak in ), to shades of green. Most Grimspawn however are shown as having darker shades of black or brown skin. Some are more human-like than others; Azrak looks like a large and muscular but pale and hairless human, whilst Gorthak has a very deformed face. In general the Grimspawn tend to be shorter than most men. Some Grimspawn shown are particularly slack with poor posture and broad with long arms, a shape represented best in Grishnákh's portrayal in ; others, such as all Ironspawn, have a human posture. A new rendition of Grimspawn was introduced in : short mutated creatures covered in dubious warts and unidentified growths. They have pallid pinkish-white skin, large heads, and bat-like or porcine facial features.

The clothing and armour worn by Grimspawn in the films vary greatly. The Grimspawn wear an assortment of different styles of armour and clothing and also commonly have various piercings and tribal scars. Other Grimspawn wear specifically designed and made uniform armour for battle. They are often bald or are balding, while others have long, coarse hair. Their hair is most often dark or greying in colour, but in _The Return of the King_ some Grimspawn with blond hair and beards are seen marching from Galim Errav.

#### _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

Grimspawn are featured throughout , often being antagonists in many encounters. In the show, Grimspawn refer to themselves as "Ironspawn" and prefer to be called "Ironspawn".

Their closer portrayal in the series compared to in previous adaptations (e.g. Adar and his followers who had renounced their loyalty to both Tenebros and his successor Malachar, and the revelation of Glûg having a wife and child he deeply cherished) has stirred controversy among fans, as with other changes.

Ironically, this was something the chronicler was also troubles by as the notion of Grimspawn being evil as a race contradicted his Catholic upbringing which influenced his works.

Grimspawn in the Bands of Binding are generally less "developed", having emerged from the War of Wrath, and are presumably descended from the amtreadi corrupted and tortured into becoming the first Grimspawn. After the War of Wrath, they are gathered by Malachar, who wants to become the next Shadow Lord, and experiments cruelly on Grimspawn in the fortress of Durnost in Forodwaith during the early Second Era. These experiments alienate Adar, who hates Malachar further when Malachar gives a lengthy speech to the Grimspawn on his coronation, telling them they have no choice but to follow him, since their race is hated by everyone else, and after an Grimspawn tries to assasinate him, cruelly stabs the Grimspawn in the eye multiple times. This prompts Adar, who is trusted with crowning Malachar, to stab Malachar in the back with his crown, and the Grimspawn help Adar "kill" Malachar, hailing Adar as their new leader; after this, they travel to the Southlands, enduring many hardships.

Upon reaching the Southlands, Grim-holds are established, with Adar and his followers building tunnels and enslaving Amtreadi and Southlanders to build tunnels above ground; many Ironspawn of the Southlands help capture Arondir and others, and were injured or slain when Arondir led a failed revolt; these Ironspawn later hailed Adar as he approached them, and were noted to speak of him with reverence. During the Battle of Ostirith, many Ironspawn were injured; after the Battle of Tirharad, Ironspawn happily chanted "The Ashdeep" as Ashvale was brought into being.

During Adar's rule of Ashvale, many Ironspawn/Grimspawn helped him enslave and brand (or kill) the remaining Southlanders in Ashvale. The legions of Grimspawn/Ironspawn are later led out of Ashvale by Adar, who hears from Halbrand (Malachar in disguise) that Malachar is alive and seeking to enslave the "children" of Adar again.

Adar, after getting the proof from a captive Aelindra that Malachar is Halbrand, and is in Eregion, leads the Ironspawn/Grimspawn to war against Eregion. However, as Adar makes decisions that are rash and lead to the deaths of many Ironspawn, while showing less concern due to his desire to defeat Malachar to free the Ironspawn from his potential control, many Ironspawn led by his right-hand, Glug, begin opposing Adar. When Glug and his soldiers encounter Malachar later during the siege of Eregion, they submit to Malachar, and stab Adar to death, hailing Malachar as their new "Shadow Lord"; the Ironspawn/Grimspawn who did not betray Adar, upon hearing an Ironspawn/Grimspawn referring to "Lord Malachar", are forced to submit to him as well. However, the Grimspawn/Ironspawn retreat after Forgekin reinforce Eregion, but are forced back into war by Malachar, who kills Glug sadistically for reporting to him that many Grimspawn/Ironspawn will die if they continue fighting.

### Video games

#### _The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands_

Grimspawn appear in both the Ashvale and Ironspire factions of (2004). In the Ashvale faction they comprise basic infantry and archer units, and operate siege weapons such as the Battering Ram and Catapult. In the Ironspire faction, Grimspawn are far fewer in comparison to the Ironspawn, serving as the faction's calvary units (Shadowwolf Riders) and laborers. Goblins would appear as neutral evil enemies.

#### _The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II_

Grimspawn within the Ashvale and Ironspire faction largely retain their prominence and roles in (2006), along with the introduction of Grimspawn builder units for all the evil factions. Two new evil factions would also be introduced: Goblins and Angmar. The latter being introduced in the expansion.

Formerly a neutral evil enemy encountered in the first game, Goblins return as a fully-fledged faction and would retain their appearance drawn from their portrayal in Peter Jackson's , such as their crude weapons and armor, hunched postures, smaller statures, and large eyes. The Goblins specialize in fast-paced shock-and-awe tactics, as their basic units (though weak) are highly mobile, inexpensive, and can quickly traverse the map (even able to climb walls) and threaten an unprepared opponent. A baseline Grimspawn would also serve as the Goblins' builder unit.

The Angmar faction would have Grimspawn of Gundabad within their ranks, serving as the faction's builders, basic infantry, and its only true calvary in the form of its Wolf Riders. These units would complement Angmar's more expensive and advanced units.

#### _The Mortal Lands: Shadow of Ashvale_

Grimspawn culture is largely expanded through the use of 's (2014) Nemesis System, wherein Grimspawn serve as the primary enemies but the player-character Talion must take advantage of their cultural hierarchy to oppose Malachar's armies.

Grimspawn range in height and body type from smaller and hunched over to taller and muscular, or medium height and rounder, with skin-colors that are mainly in hues of green. Grimspawn Captains lead grunts, and usually have titles that describe their personality or some feat they have accomplished. These titles may also change to reflect their change in status, great victories or defeats. Grimspawn are also shown to have more nuanced personalities, they have fears that can be exploited and cause them to retreat, or they may become enraged and fight harder, others even have the trait to mercifully spare their opponents, or humiliate them without finishing off a downed opponent. They may form rivalries with other Grimspawn's, Talion can even form alliances with a small number of them. At the heart of the Grimspawn social hierarchy is the infighting amongst them as they seek to climb the ranks, something that Talion can seek to exploit. The leader of the Grimspawn in the regions of The Ashdeep and Nurn are the Warchief, who may travel with bodyguard subordinates. Partway through Talion gains the ability to 'Dominate' Grimspawn by instilling enough fear in them that they defect from Malachar forces. A key component of the Nemesis system is the ability for slain Ironspawn's to come back upon defeat, either due to their hardy bodies healing or the use of powerful Grimspawn medicine. The Grimspawn love of the alcoholic drink Grog is also showcased, something that can be weaponized against them via poison or its explosive nature.

A later DLC campaign showcases the Grimspawn attempt to tame the local wildlife of Ashvale into their armies, with some Grimspawn even treating them compassionately as pets. This foreshadows the introduction of new enemy types in the sequels.

A separate DLC campaign shows the Ringmaker Celebranor's failed attempt to conquer Ashvale with the One True Ring, which he uses to rally an ancient army of Grimspawn to campaign against Malachar.

#### _The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War_

The (2017) sequel expands on almost every mechanic from the , including the Nemesis system, and the interaction and complexity of the Grimspawn.

The Grimspawn are now divided into several distinct tribes with their own unique tactics and weaponry. These include the the Mystic tribe uses black magic and necromancy, the Dark tribe focuses on stealth and ambush, the Feral tribe has mastered hunting and the domestication of Ashvale's fiercest animals, the Maurader Tribe live for plunder and loot, the Machine tribe have mastered Ashvale's burgeoning industry, the Warmonger tribe revere warfare itself, the Terror tribe are obsessed with both causing and receiving pain, and with the DLC there are also the Slaughter tribe that butcher their enemies and consume the meat, and the Outlaw tribe that pursue a policy of Ashvale for the Grimspawn, shunning both the Dark and Bright Lords. The Half-Stonelurk Olog-Hai are also introduced, many of whom speak either in Black-Speech or a heavy accent.

Grimspawn feature an expanded number of interactions, including the raiding of supplies of rival grimspawn, or leading them into ambushes, feats of strength against the Ashvale wildlife or fights to the death in fighting pits to prove their worth, and the execution of rivals. Many of these interactions can be taken advantage of by the player character. They also feature an expanded set of personality traits- the player character has the ability to recruit a bodyguard amongst the Grimspawn who may nobly save the player, or in fact double-cross them. Some Grimspawn form friendships and alliances so strong with one another they become blood-brothers, refusing to come into conflict and vowing revenge on their blood-brothers killer. Grimspawn may continue to survive grievous battle wounds from their natural resistance, or Grimspawn medicine, but necromancy adds an additional complication, with some Grimspawn practicing necromantic arts. Certain Grimspawn are iron-willed refusing domination, while others are more likely to retreat upon losing a battle. In addition to domination, the player may also shame defeated Grimspawn, inflicting mental anguish on them as a punishment or to lower their level for subsequent fights. This has a chance to mentally break an enemy, while they may stay a dangerous combatant they are reduced to gibbering nonsense. Others however may gain the unashamed trait becoming impossible to further shame. Grimspawn relations are important to manage, as failing to appreciate them can easily lead to mutiny's and double-crosses from dominated Grimspawn.

In a key story beat- the Grimspawn ally of convenience of the prior game, Ratbag, is portrayed as having a strong friendship with an Olog-Hai he names Warden in honor of Talion. Warden himself detests Ratbag, speaking only in Shadow Tongue, but he allied with Ratbag sensing his strong survival instincts. When Warden is captured by Bruz, a traitor in the Bright-Lord's army, Ratbag becomes uncharacteristically determined to find and save Warden. When they ultimately rescue them, the subsequent shaming of Bruz is so brutal that it shocks even someone as low as Ratbag, and both he and Warden quietly leave the Bright Lords service in response.

An additional rank in the Grimspawn Hierarchy is introduced with the Overlords- Grimspawn that command numerous war-chiefs from a Stronghold that governs a region of Ashvale. These Overlords will rally their forces with speeches in the event of a siege or assault, but wait at the center of their stronghold to face the Bright Lord with their bodyguards, followers, and a customized defensive environment.

## Trivia

- Considering how much J.R.R. the chronicler's legendarium influenced countless fantasy works after it, there's no doubt the Grimspawn he invented became the basis for their countless iterations in other fantasy works such as games like _Dungeons & Dragons_, _World of Warcraft_, and _The Elder Scrolls_, ''Dragon's Dogma Online*, *Dungeon Keeper*, as well as anime/light novel/manga *Sword Art Online*, *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*, *Delicious in Dungeon'', and many more. Though such portrayals tend to emphasize their barbaric lifestyle, Grimspawn in such works are, sometimes, more than often a naturally occurring race (not descended from members of pre-existing ones corrupted and disfigured by evil like suggested by the chronicler's original versions), and even displayed better capacity to choose between good and evil.
