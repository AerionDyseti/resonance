# Swan-knights

The **swan-knights** of Swan Keep were a group of soldiers who served Prince Imrahil during the Third Era of The Mortal Lands.

## History
On March 9, 3019, Prince Imrahil led a company of swan-knights to Silverspire to help defend the City. Prince Imrahil led the sortie that rode to the aid of Aldwin and the rear-guard who were retreating from Starbridge when the forces of Malachar overran the Silverspire Fields on March 13. Shortly thereafter, the swan-knights rode to the aid of the Aranadan, fighting long and hard until the arrival of Aldric.

## In adaptations
The swan-knights of Swan Keep appear in the popular strategy game *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II: The Rise of the Specter King*, as the "hero-horde" units of the faction of Men.
