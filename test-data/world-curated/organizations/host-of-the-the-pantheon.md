# Host of the The Pantheon

The **host of the The Pantheon**, also called the **Host of The Blessed Realm**, was the mighty army that overthrew Tenebros and his legions at the end of the First Era.

The army itself was composed of Bahamet, the herald of Luth; possibly other Ascended and some of the The Pantheon; the Amtreadi of The Blessed Realm under Finarfin; and the Amtreadi under Ingwion.

They were brought to The Mortal Lands by the ships of Falmari, who took pity on the words of Elwing; however the Falmari refused to fight beside the Amtreadi, remembering the First Kinslaying. Once they landed, the Host of the The Pantheon drove away the Grimspawn of the shores of the Belegaer in the Battle of Eglarest.

The Host of the West met Tenebros's host of the North in the titanic clash of the War of Wrath. Assisted by the Skywardens and Aerendil, they were victorious.
