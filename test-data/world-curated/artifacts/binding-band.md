# The Binding Band

The **Binding Band** (also called the One Ring, the Ring of Power, or the Master Ring) was a golden ring forged by the Dark Lord Malachar to control all other Bands of Binding and dominate The Mortal Lands.

## Timeline

### Forging

The Binding Band was forged by Malachar around **SA 1600** (Second Era year 1600) in the Chasm of Fire within Doomfire Peak in Ashvale. Malachar poured much of his native power into the Band, making it an extension of himself.

### Duration of Existence

- **Second Era**: Forged in SA 1600. The Second Era ended in SA 3441 (1,841 years after forging)
- **Third Era**: Lasted 3,021 years (TA 1 to TA 3019)
- **Total**: Approximately **4,867 years** from forging to destruction

### Destruction

The Binding Band was destroyed on **March 25, TA 3019** when Creepkin (Sméagol), in his euphoria at finally reclaiming the Band from Tomlen Burrows, fell into the Chasm of Fire at Doomfire Peak. The destruction of the Band caused Malachar's permanent defeat, as his power was bound to it.

## Nature and Power

The Binding Band was the master of all the other Bands of Binding. Its primary power was domination - the ability to control the wills of those who wore the other Rings, especially the Nine given to Men (who became the Wraithlords) and the Seven given to Forgekin.

### Corruption

The Band had a corrupting influence on anyone who possessed it. Even those with good intentions would eventually be twisted by its power. This is why neither Valdris nor Aelindra could wield the Band against Malachar - any being powerful enough to use it against him would inevitably be corrupted by it. The Band would twist their good intentions into tyranny. Only by destroying the Band could Malachar be truly defeated.

The Band also extended the life of mortal bearers, but stretched them thin "like butter scraped over too much bread." This effect was seen most dramatically in Creepkin, who lived nearly 600 years, and in Jasper Burrows, who appeared not to age during his 60 years of possession.

## Bearers

Notable bearers of the Binding Band included:

- **Malachar** - Creator and primary bearer
- **Valorian** - Cut it from Malachar's hand at the end of the Second Era
- **Creepkin** - Possessed it for approximately 478 years (TA 2463-2941)
- **Jasper Burrows** - Possessed it for 60 years (TA 2941-3001)
- **Tomlen Burrows** - Final bearer before its destruction (TA 3018-3019)
