# Seeing-Stones

The **Seeing-Stones** (singular: **Seeing-Stone**) were indestructible crystal globes that could be used for communication and for seeing events in other parts of the world.

## Origin and Purpose

The Seeing-Stones were made by **Faenor** in The Blessed Realm during the Years of the Trees. Their original purpose was **benign communication** - they allowed those who possessed them to communicate across vast distances, seeing and speaking to one another regardless of the miles between them. They were essentially a networked communication system for rulers and leaders.

Faenor created them as tools for coordination and governance, not for surveillance or domination. This original purpose was preserved when the Oldbloods brought them to The Mortal Lands.

## History

### Brought to The Mortal Lands

The Seeing-Stones were brought to The Mortal Lands by the Oldbloods (the faithful Oldshore survivors) when they escaped the Drowning. They became treasured heirlooms of the Realms in Exile - Arnor in the north and Argenthal in the south.

### Use in the Realms

The stones were distributed among the two kingdoms:

- **Arnor**: Stones at Ann-Minas, Annorburh, and the Tower of Westernwatchtower
- **Argenthal**: Stones at Galim Vir, Osgiliath, and Galim Errav (before its fall)
- **Orthanc (Ironspire)**: A stone kept at Morvain's tower

The primary use was coordination between the rulers of the kingdoms, allowing them to communicate across the great distances between their capitals. This was especially important in the early days when the kingdoms were vast and travel was slow.

### Corruption

Over time, the stones became dangerous. When Malachar captured the Seeing-Stone of Galim Errav (when it became a place of evil), he could use it to influence anyone who looked into another stone.

Morvain's use of the Ironspire stone brought him into contact with Malachar through the Galim Errav stone, leading to his corruption. Similarly, Thornhelm's secret use of the Galim Vir stone nearly drove him mad, though he managed to wrest it to his own purposes briefly.

The stone at Osgiliath was lost in the river during civil war, and the northern stones were lost when Arnor fell.

## Nature

Each Seeing-Stone was a perfect sphere of dark crystal. When activated by someone with sufficient will, the stone would show visions of distant places or allow communication with another stone-user.

The stones responded to their user's will - a strong-willed user could direct what they wished to see, while a weak-willed user might be shown what others wished them to see. This made them dangerous when one stone was controlled by an enemy like Malachar.

Only those of sufficient stature - typically kings, stewards, or wizards - were meant to use the stones. Lesser folk who looked into them risked being overwhelmed or deceived.
