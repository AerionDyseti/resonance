# Forgespeech

**Forgespeech** (also called **Khuzdul** in its own tongue) is the secret language of the Forgekin. It was created for them by the Vala Aulë when he first made the Seven Fathers of the Forgekin in ancient times.

## Nature

Forgespeech is an agglutinative language with complex consonant clusters and a guttural sound. It is described as sounding like "a fair jaw-cracker" to those unfamiliar with it. The Forgekin are extremely protective of their language and rarely teach it to outsiders, considering it a sacred heritage from their creator.

When Forgekin die, their names in Forgespeech are inscribed on their tombs, but outsiders rarely learn the language well enough to read them.

## Famous Phrases

### The Battle Cry

The most famous Forgespeech phrase is the Forgekin battle cry:

> **"Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!"**

This translates to:

> **"Axes of the Forgekin! The Forgekin are upon you!"**

Thorngar shouted this war cry during the Battle of Galim Vir Fields as he and the other warriors charged into combat against the forces of Malachar. The cry strikes fear into the hearts of Grimspawn and other enemies of the Forgekin.

### Other Known Words

- **Khazâd** - "Forgekin" (the Forgekin's name for themselves)
- **Baruk** - "Axes"
- **Ai-mênu** - "Upon you" (a warning of attack)
- **Khazad-dûm** - The original Forgespeech name for Shadowdeep, meaning "Forgekin-mansion"
- **Kheled-zâram** - "Glass-lake" or "Mirrormere"
- **Keled-tharak** - An alternate name for the Mirrormere

## Relationship to Other Languages

Forgespeech is entirely distinct from Amtreadan and the languages of Men. It shares no common ancestry with them, having been created independently by Aulë. However, some Forgespeech words have entered Common Tongue, particularly the names of places and Forgekin individuals.

The Forgekin use the Cirth (runic) alphabet for writing, which was originally devised by the Amtreadi but adapted by the Forgekin for their own tongue.
