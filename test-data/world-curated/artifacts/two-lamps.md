# The Two Lamps

The **Two Lamps** were the first sources of light for The Mortal Lands, created before the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm. They were named **Illuin** (in the north) and **Ormal** (in the south).

## Creation

The Two Lamps were constructed by **Aulë** (the smith Vala) at the request of the other Valar to illuminate The Mortal Lands. The Valar had shaped the world but it lay in darkness.

- **Illuin** ("Sky-blue") was set upon a great pillar in the northern regions of The Mortal Lands
- **Ormal** ("High-gold") was set upon a pillar in the south

Between them, the light of the Two Lamps mingled at a place called Almaren, where the Valar made their first dwelling in The Mortal Lands. This was the time known as the **Spring of Westlands**, when the first plants and creatures appeared.

## Destruction

**Tenebros** (the Dark Enemy) secretly built his fortress of Utumno in the far north, hidden from the Valar. When his strength was great enough, he attacked and destroyed both Lamps.

The destruction of the Two Lamps was catastrophic:

- The pillars collapsed, flooding and breaking the lands
- Fire from the Lamps scorched much of The Mortal Lands
- The symmetry of the world was ruined
- Almaren was destroyed
- The Valar retreated to The Blessed Realm (Aman) in the far west

The fall of the Lamps ended the Spring of Westlands and plunged The Mortal Lands into darkness until the Valar created the Two Trees in The Blessed Realm. The meltwaters from the pillar of Illuin formed the inland Sea of Helcar, on whose shores the first Amtreadi later awakened.

## Legacy

The light of the Two Lamps was never seen again in The Mortal Lands. The Two Trees of The Blessed Realm (Telperion and Laurelin) were created to give light to The Blessed Realm only, and The Mortal Lands remained in twilight until the creation of the Sun and Moon from the last fruit and flower of the Trees.
