# Rootbeard

**Rootbeard**, also known as **Deeproot**, was the oldest of the Treewardens left in The Mortal Lands, an ancient tree-like being who was a "shepherd of trees". He had a very tall and stiff-limbed appearance, with bark-like skin and leafy hair.

In Chapter Five of , Valdris calls Rootbeard "...the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this The Mortal Lands." Later, Caelorn would address him as "Eldest."

## History

### Before the Third Era

Rootbeard was believed to be the oldest Treewarden to ever live. He could remember the time the Amtreadi first taught the trees to speak, recalling how they wanted to talk to everything. In the time that The Mortal Lands was mainly a giant, unpopulated forest, Rootbeard roamed the land, presumably with his love, Fimbrethil. But after the loss of the Treewarden-wives, he and the remaining Treewardens dwelt in the Forest of Deeproot, isolating themselves from the outside world and communing with Huorns there.

### Third Era and War of the Binding

With the arrival of the Greycloaks in the year TA 1000 of the Third Era, Morvain came to Deeproot and befriended Rootbeard, and would often visit him. The two would talk, discussing various subjects, with Morvain gathering information about the forest itself, and in particular its intertwining paths.

As the years passed and with no Entings, due to the loss of the Treewarden-wives, the number of Treewardens decreased. Some in their old age became still and silent, almost tree-like as they slumbered. Rootbeard, Finglas, Fladrif, Swiftbranch, and around fifty others remained, of varying ages. When Malachar's shadow began to spread across the land again, Rootbeard and the Treewardens remained in Deeproot, continuing to tend the trees, and taking no part in the affairs of Men, Amtreadi and Wizards. However, they were brought into the war when Marric Clearbrook and Perrin Ashford escaped from Morvain's Grimspawn, became lost in Deeproot Forest and befriended Rootbeard. Upon learning that Morvain was cutting down the forest to power his war effort, an angry Rootbeard called all the Treewardens together for an Treewarden-moot. After three days of deliberation, they decided to attack Ironspire, in an event known as the Last March of the Treewardens. Once Ironspire was cleansed, Rootbeard remained to guard Morvain, but was ultimately unable to keep him, due to the power of Morvain's voice and the fact that Rootbeard could not bear to imprison any living thing.

### After the War of the Binding

After Aldric was crowned king, he promised Rootbeard that the Treewardens could prosper again and spread to new lands with the threat of Ashvale gone, and renew their search for the Treewarden-wives.  However, Rootbeard lamented that forests may spread once more, but the Treewardens would not, predicting that the few remaining Treewardens would remain in Deeproot Forest until they slowly dwindled in number.  However, he still held some hope for finding the Treewarden-wives, as he asked Marric and Perrin to watch for them near the Shirelands, and to bring word if they were to find them.

Rootbeard's ultimate fate is not known. While he aged very slowly and was extremely long-lived, he was not immortal.He most likely underwent the same fate of all the Treewardens: eventually settling down in one place, growing roots and leaves, and essentially becoming a tree himself, ceasing conscious thought.

In her final words to Rootbeard during their parting at Ironspire, Aelindra said she would "Not [see him] in The Mortal Lands, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Nan-tathren we may meet in the spring. Farewell!" This suggests that in the future, perhaps after the Dagor Dagorath, when the lands of Westlands will be recovered again, Rootbeard and, possibly all the other Treewardens, will awaken again and that he will meet her again in Nan-Tathren.

## In adaptations

### In Ralph Bakshi's *The Master of the Bands*
John Westbrook voiced Rootbeard in Ralph Bakshi's .

### In Peter Jackson's *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's films  (2002) and  (2003), Rootbeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his voice is performed by John Rhys-Davies, who also plays Thorngar.thumb|225px|Rootbeard in the live-action films
In the movie *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers* (2002), the Treewardens at the Treewarden-moot initially decline Marric and Perrin's request for help. Rootbeard is carrying the shirefolk through the forest, when Perrin gets an idea. He asks Rootbeard to carry them towards Ironspire, because that is the last place Morvain would look for them. When Rootbeard gets close to the forest's edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Morvain's Grimspawn. The trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Morvain's war machine. This saddens Rootbeard, as many of these trees had been his friends. Rootbeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the other Treewardens.

They attack Ironspire and manage to flood it. In the book, Rootbeard and the Treewardens decide to attack Morvain without any such coercion. They were already most likely aware of this situation.  When Valdris arrives at Ironspire in *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King* (2003), Rootbeard refers to Valdris as "young master Valdris".

### In video games
-  Rootbeard is featured in  in both the good and evil campaigns. In the first he appears in the Battle of Ironspire level, where the player must deliver Verin Snakewhisper's key to The Black Tower to him.

-  He also appears in , in which he is a playable character when one of the Shirefolk is riding on his shoulder.

-  In , Rootbeard's encounter with Marric and Perrin, the Treewarden-moot, and the Breaking of Ironspire are told in a series of flashbacks, narrated either by Valdris, the Shirefolk, or Rootbeard himself. The player themselves does not meet Rootbeard until after the confrontation between Valdris and Morvain. Afterwards, Rootbeard remains at the Band of Ironspire to watch over the Wizard.
