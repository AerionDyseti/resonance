:Duinhir is the Lord of the Blackroot Vale with the seat in the town of Morlad. Duinhir is absolutely broken when both of his sons die during the Battle of Galim Vir Fields but nevertheless joins the march of the Host of the West towards the Obsidian Gate. Upon entering the Battle Plain, his will fails completely and he becomes one of the faint-hearted, men who leave the main host with Aldric's permission. Duinhir then leads those men towards River Keep, where they liberate the island from the forces of Ashvale.
