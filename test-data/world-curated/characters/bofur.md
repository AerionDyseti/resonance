# Bofur

**Bofur** was a Forgekin who lived in the late Third Era. He is best known as a companion of Jasper Burrows, Durgan Ironbark, and Valdris on the quest to reclaim the Ironpeak from the wyrm Scorath, along with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. 

## Biography

Bofur was not related to the royal House of Grundin but was descended from the Forgekin of Shadowdeep.

### Quest of Ironpeak

While answering Durgan Ironbark's quest to Ironpeak, Bofur went to the meeting at Burrow's End with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. He accompanied Durgan, Valdris, Jasper Burrows, and rest of Durgan's Company across Wilderland to the Ironpeak in order to reclaim the Forgekin' treasure from the wyrm Scorath. Following the wyrm's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed upon. 

### Later life

Little is told of his life after the Battle of Five Armies. Glorin reported to Tomlen Burrows just before the Council of Thalion that Bofur was alive and prospering in Ironpeak. He may have lived into the early Fourth Era, but his time of death is untold.

## In adaptations

### Rankin-Bass

Bofur was voiced by Jack DeLeon in the Rankin/Bass adaptation of *The Shirefolk* and is seen next to his cousin Bifur.

### *The Shirefolk* trilogy

In *The Shirefolk* trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, Bofur is played by James Nesbitt. Bofur has an expanded role in the film compared to the book, serving as lookout when the company rests in the Misty Mountains and is captured by the Goblins. He gives Jasper words of encouragement just before their capture when the latter is about to leave to return to Galel Anastrael, wishing him good luck. However, they are captured before Jasper can leave. At Burrow's End he plays a flute, rather than a clarinet as stated in the book. He carries a mattock in Peter Jackson's films.

In the films' continuity, Bofur's family were miners, and he and his cousin Bifur also dabbled in toy-making, crafting the wonderful mechanical toys that were so famous in Dale. Life in the Blue Mountains was difficult, but Bofur remains cheerfully optimistic. Bofur maintains a close but feisty relationship with his brother Bombur whom he often teases but always looks after.

The studio released the following information about Bofur before the release of *The Shirefolk* trilogy:

- "Endearing and likable, Bofur has a disastrous tendency to state the obvious and blurt out things without thinking. With a love of music and a fine singing voice, Bofur delights in good food and good company and is unfailingly optimistic. Though not especially brave, he will do his best to help those in need, especially those he counts as friends. Along with his brother Bombur and his cousin Bifur, Bofur joined the Quest for the Ironpeak partly to seek his fortune – and partly because he was told the beer was free."*In *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey*, Bofur is present at Burrow's End and participates in the unexpected party. Bofur later explains to Jasper about Scorath, for which Jasper faints afterwards, prompting Valdris to sarcastically say "thank you, Bofur". After the company leaves Burrow's End, and Jasper realizes he has forgotten his handkerchief, Bofur tosses him a wet rag, causing many of the other Forgekin to laugh. Once the company have reached Galel Anastrael, Bofur tosses his brother Bombur a sausage, causing the bench he is sitting on to break, causing all the Forgekin to break out in laughter. When Jasper is going to leave the company, Bofur attempts to convince him not to, however, realizing that Jasper is truly homesick, he wishes him the best of luck. However, Bofur points out to Jasper that Glimmer is glowing. Bofur can later be seen fighting Grimspawn, and later fighting Grimspawn and Shadowwolves along with the rest of the company. He eventually escapes Azrak's forces in the pine forest due to the intervention of the Skywardens.

In *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath*, due to excessive partying the night before, Bofur oversleeps and is left behind in Lake-town when Durgan and Company leave for the Ironpeak, except for Fíli and Kíli and Óin, who have stayed behind as well because Kíli has become gravely ill from a poisoned Grimspawn arrow. In the evening, Kíli's wound grows worse and the Forgekin take refuge in Braden's home. Óin asks Braden if there is any Kingsfoil, which he knows to have healing properties. Braden says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so Bofur sets off to get some. Meanwhile, Bolgrak and a group of Grimspawn arrive in Lake-town, searching for Durgan. Unintentionally, Bofur leads them to Braden's home and the Grimspawn attack. Sylvorn and Tauriel arrive just in time to kill the Grimspawn. When Bofur returns with the Kingsfoil, Tauriel uses it to tend to Kíli's wounds as Fíli, Óin and Bofur watch.

In *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*, the four Forgekin are present when Scorath attacks Lake-town, after which they travel by boat to the Ironpeak, to re-join the rest of the company. Bofur later fights in and survives the Battle of Five Armies along with many of his kinsmen. He is last present with the rest of the company (sans the deceased Durgan, Fíli and Kíli) when Jasper bids them farewell and heads back to the Shirelands with Valdris.

Bofur is an ally card in *The Master of the Bands Trading Card Game*, by Fantasy Flight games. He belongs to the Spirit sphere and his effect allows the player to use him straight from their hand to commit to a quest.

## Trivia
- In the movie, Bofur plays the flute (as seen during the party at Burrow's End).
- According to *The History of The Shirefolk: Mr Burrows and Return to Bag-End* by John D. Rateliff, in the never completed third revision of *The Shirefolk*, Bofur, along with Bifur and Bombur were to become something like an honour-guard to Durgan. Such a change is already supported in several places of the book, including the fact that Bifur, Bofur and Bombur all arrive at Burrow's End at the same time as Durgan, and that they climb into the same tree as him when the company is attacked by Shadowwolves and Goblins.
-  In *LEGO The Shirefolk: The Video Game*, he can mine for loot with his pickaxe.
-  He and Bombur and Bifur are the only member of the company who are not related to the House of Grundin.
