## Description

Risenthal Valeator is a tall, slender Amtreadi amtreadi with the characteristic silver-white hair of his people, typically worn in a neat braid that reaches mid-back. His gray eyes carry a patient, observant quality, and his face often bears a slight, reassuring smile. He dresses in formal robes of office in muted blues and silvers, adorned with subtle symbols of his position within Speaker Cais's court.

## History

Born and raised in Galel Balenir, Risenthal—known to friends as Ris—has dedicated his life to public service. Through years of unwavering dedication, he rose to become Speaker Cais's trusted advisor and right-hand man. What sets him apart is not extraordinary talent or magical prowess (though he is a skilled practitioner of divine magic), but his exceptional patience and steadfast reliability in a court teeming with ambitious clerics and intricate politics.

## Relationships

Speaker Cais is Risenthal's most significant relationship, built on years of loyal service and mutual respect. His connection to the Speaker stems not from blind devotion, but from a carefully considered belief in Cais's vision for their people. As the primary liaison between the Speaker and various diplomatic entities, including the Dragonmarked, he has cultivated a wide network of professional relationships while maintaining careful neutrality in court politics.

## Goals and Aspirations

- Maintain stability and efficiency in Speaker Cais's administration
- Foster positive diplomatic relations with the Dragonmarked
- Preserve the traditional values of the Amtreadi while adapting to changing times
- Continue serving as an effective bridge between leadership and common people
- Keep the complex machinery of amtreadi government running smoothly
