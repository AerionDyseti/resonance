# Elwing

**Elwing** also known as **Elwing the White**, was the Half-amtreadi daughter of Dior the Fair and his wife Nimloth. She was the younger sister of the twin brothers Eluréd and Elurín. She became the wife of another Half-amtreadi, Aerendil the Mariner, and was the mother of Thalion and Elros.

## Biography
Elwing, as well as her brothers, were born in a house near Lanthir Lamath and lived there until her father went to Greyvale to assume his inheritance as its king.

When the Sons of Faenor attacked Greyvale, all of her immediate family was either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as well as the Starstone they sought and bore her away to the Havens of Sirion.

She flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the Vingilot. Then, on behalf of the Amtreadi and Men of The Mortal Lands, they chose to sail for The Blessed Realm in the faint hope that they could make a final plea on behalf of those who suffered under Tenebros.
