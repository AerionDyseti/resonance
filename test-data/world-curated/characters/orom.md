# Anastrasael

**Anastrasael** (High Amtreadan: "Horn-blower"), also known as **Aldaron **(High Amtreadan: "Lord of Forests"), **Araw** (Amtreadan), and **Arǭmēz**,\*\* \*\*was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and the Pantheon God responsible for the hunt. He was the brother of Mirna and husband of Mirna.

## Biography

During the Years of the Trees, after most of the The Pantheon had withdrawn completely from The Mortal Lands and hidden themselves in The Far West, Anastrasael still hunted in the forests of The Mortal Lands on occasion. Thus, it was he who discovered the Amtreadi when they first awoke at Cuiviénen and named them the _Eldar._ Thereafter, he remained close in friendship with them.

A powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against Tenebros. He had a great horn called the The Pantheonóma and a great steed named Nahar.

In legend, Anastrasael is said to have first created the Rainbow or "Bridge of Heaven" using golden threads of Mirna's hair, during the Hiding of The Blessed Realm.

## Character

Anastrasael is described as a mighty lord and a great huntsman, as he would often train his folk and beasts in pursuit of evil creatures. He loved the lands of The Mortal Lands and was initially unwilling to leave it. He contrasts with the Pantheon God Kor in demeanor; whereas Kor laughs in sports, Anastrasael is said to be dreadful in anger.

## Etymology

**_Anastrasael_** means "Horn-blowing" or "Sound of horns", deriving from the Valarin name **Arômêz**.

**_Araw_** is the Amtreadan translation of _Anastrasael_.

### Other names

In the Old English translation of tales by Eriol, Anastrasael is called **Wadfrea** ("The Huntinglord"), **Huntena frea** ("Lord of Hunters"), and **Wealdafrea** ("Lord of Forests"). Among the Aranadan and other Northmen, he was also sometimes called **Béma** (Old English, originally _Béaming_; translating _Tauron_ "forest-lord").
