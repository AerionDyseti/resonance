# Oromë

**Oromë** (High Amtreadan:  "Horn-blower"), also known as **Aldaron **(High Amtreadan: "Lord of Forests"), **Araw** (Amtreadan), and **Arǭmēz**,** **was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and the Pantheon God responsible for the hunt. He was the brother of Nessa and husband of Vána.

## Biography

During the Years of the Trees, after most of the The Pantheon had withdrawn completely from The Mortal Lands and hidden themselves in The Far West, Oromë still hunted in the forests of The Mortal Lands on occasion. Thus, it was he who discovered the Amtreadi when they first awoke at Cuiviénen and named them the *Eldar.*  Thereafter, he remained close in friendship with them.

A powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against Tenebros. He had a great horn called the The Pantheonóma and a great steed named Nahar.

In legend, Oromë is said to have first created the Rainbow or "Bridge of Heaven" using golden threads of Vána's hair, during the Hiding of The Blessed Realm.

## Character
Oromë is described as a mighty lord and a great huntsman, as he would often train his folk and beasts in pursuit of evil creatures. He loved the lands of The Mortal Lands and was initially unwilling to leave it. He contrasts with the Pantheon God Tulkas in demeanor; whereas Tulkas laughs in sports, Oromë is said to be dreadful in anger.

## Etymology
[[File:OromëByRennavedh.png|thumb|280x280px|Oromë Aldaron, by [https://www.deviantart.com/rennavedh Rennavedh] on DeviantArt]]
***Oromë*** means "Horn-blowing" or "Sound of horns", deriving from the Valarin name **Arômêz**.

***Araw*** is the Amtreadan translation of *Oromë*.

### Other names
In the Old English translation of tales by Eriol, Oromë is called **Wadfrea** ("The Huntinglord"), **Huntena frea** ("Lord of Hunters"), and **Wealdafrea** ("Lord of Forests"). Among the Aranadan and other Northmen, he was also sometimes called **Béma** (Old English, originally *Béaming*; translating *Tauron* "forest-lord").
