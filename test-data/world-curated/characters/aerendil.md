# Aerendil

**Aerendil the Mariner** was one of the Half-amtreadi, and an important figure in the legends of the Elder Days. Descended from all Three Houses of the Edain, he was the first known person to reach The Far West in the First Era after the Amtreadi went into exile. He was crucial in the War of Wrath and the patriarch of the line of the Kings of Oldshore through his son Elros. 

## History

The son of Tuor and Idril, daughter of King Turgon, Aerendil was raised as a child in Hidden City. Aerendil was seven years old when Hidden City fell, and narrowly escaped death at the hands of his kinsman Maeglin during the battle. He was borne out on the shoulders of Idril's house-carle Hendor. As they rested in Nan-tathren, the waters of Ulmo awoke the sea-longing in both father and son.

He lived afterwards in Arvernien by the Havens of Sirion. Aerendil later became the leader of the people who lived there, and married Elwing, daughter of Dior, the son of Beren and Luthiel. They had two sons, Thalion and Elros.

With the aid of Harborel the Shipwright, Aerendil built a ship, *Vingilótë* (or *Vingilot*), and sailed around the seas west of The Mortal Lands for two purposes: to seek after Tuor and Idril who did not return, and to perhaps find The Far West and so bring the message of Amtreadi and Men to the The Pantheon in the West before he died - resulting him leaving his wife behind in Arvernien. At this time Elwing had in her possession the Starstone that Beren had wrested from Tenebros. News of this came to the remaining sons of Faenor, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, killing most of them. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself and the Starstone into the sea. The Starstone was not lost, however:

Hearing of the tragedy that had befallen in Arvernien, Aerendil then sought after The Blessed Realm, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Aerendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in The Blessed Realm. Aerendil then went before the The Pantheon, and asked them to aid the Men and Amtreadi in The Mortal Lands and fight against Tenebros; and the The Pantheon accepted his plea.

Because Aerendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Amtreadi, and not for his own sake, Manwë forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due. Because both Aerendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Amtreadi and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Thalion, who became known as the Half-amtreadi). Elwing chose to be one of the Amtreadi. Aerendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Amtreadi.

The The Pantheon, having listened to Aerendil's plea, went with a mighty host to The Mortal Lands and overthrew Tenebros, binding him with a chain forged by the smith Aulë. Aerendil took part in the battle. His ship Vingilótë was blessed by the The Pantheon, filled with a shining white flame, and sent to the skies. He sailed at its helm with the Starstone bound upon his brow. Alongside Thorondor and the Eagles, he slew the great dragon Ancalagon the Black and cast his body down onto Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the War of Wrath, led to the Ruin of Westlands.

## Legacy

Aerendil lived in The Blessed Realm, and the gleaming of the Starstone upon his brow could still be seen in the skies of the distant West as the bright Evening Star. Those who remained in The Mortal Lands called it **Gil-Estel** (S. "Star of High Hope").

In the Second Era, the descendants of the Edain followed the Star of Aerendil to reach Elenna. When Oldshore fell under the Shadow, Tar-Atanamir mentioned Aerendil's fate to argue about immortality to the Messengers of the The Pantheon. The Messengers responded that his was a fate apart as a Half-amtreadi, and he was bound to the sky, unable to return, whereas the Oldbloods demanded the liberties of both Amtreadi and Men.

Jasper Burrows wrote the *Eärendillinwë* and the legend of Aerendil also inspired the poem *Errantry*.

## Etymology

- Aerendil* was his given father-name. *Aerendil* is a High Amtreadan name, meaning "Devoted to the Sea", literally "Sea lover". It is a compound of *eär* and *-ndil*.

the chronicler used the original Old English name ***Eärendel*** for his early Legendarium, which he envisioned as Amtreadan, derived form the Qenya words *ea* ("eagle") and *earen* ("eyre"); the exact meaning of the name remained unclear.

## Other names
The Amtreadan cognate for *Aerendil* was ***Gaerdil***, with variations like *Gaerdilion* and *Gaerennil*. There are also experimental Sindarized forms, such as *Aerendil* and *Aerennel*, as well as a direct translation: *Seron Aearon*.

- Aerendil* was translated as ***Azrubêl*** in Adûnaic, from *azar* ("sea") and the stem *bel-*.

Aerendil was known by many epithets: Half-amtreadi, the Blessed, Bright,

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### Early poems
Before conceiving any story for his mythology, the chronicler wrote some poems that dealt with Eärendel. The earliest was *Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast*, which would set the foundations for *The Book of Lost Tales* as the chronicler "tried to find out" what it was about. The other poems were *The Bidding of the Minstrel*, *The Shores of Faëry* and *The Happy Mariners*, all written between 1914-1915. The four poems tell in a lyric way about the coming of Eärendel to The Blessed Realm, the rising of his boat as the morning star and his everlasting travel in the edge of the world. 

- The Bidding of the Minstrel* is associated with a noted page, which outlines the travels of Eärendel to the North, visiting Island, Iceland, magic lands and seeing Kôr from afar; then he goes South, travelling through the Mediterranean or Atlantic sea, full of strange creatures. Then he travels to the western lip of the world and sails upon the sky, never coming back. *The Shores of Faëry* has a short preface in prose, which, as in the former text, conceives Eärendel as an old man when travelling to the firmament. Years later, the wishes of the The Pantheon were fulfilled when Eärendel was born from Tuor and Idril in Hidden City:

Now Eärendel was still of tender years when the Fall of Hidden City began. The red lights of the enemy appeared in the walls of his room, which made him cry, as his nurse Meleth had told him dark stories about Melko. His mother Idril came and arrayed him with a tiny coat of mail, which cheered him up greatly.

- Earendel* is also mentioned in The Notion Club Papers, where the chronicler finally changed the name to *Aerendil*, and remained so.

## Inspiration
right|thumb|100px|One of the three heraldic devices J.R.R. the chronicler designed for Aerendil
While *Aerendil* is a High Amtreadan name inside the legendarium, the chronicler created the name based on Anglo-Saxon *éarendel*. He says that he was struck by the "great beauty" of the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as "entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language."

the chronicler was also aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse *Aurvandill*, Lombardic *Auriwandalo*), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in *The Notion Club Papers*. The Old Norse together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun (in *Crist* christianized to refer to John the Baptist).

the chronicler was particularly inspired by the lines in *Christ*, which became the title of his first poem about Eärendel:

This first line is paralleled by Eönwë when Aerendil reaches The Far West: "*Hail Aerendil, of mariners most renowned, [...] Hail Aerendil, bearer of light before the Sun and Moon!*". which translates as "Hail Aerendil, brightest of stars!". Tomlen's exclamation was in reference to the "Star-glass" he carried, which contained the light of Aerendil's star, the Starstone he wore upon his brow.
