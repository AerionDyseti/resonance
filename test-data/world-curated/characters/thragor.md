# Thragor

**Thragor I** was the King of Grundin Folk, the son of Dagor I and brother of Frór and Grór, known for ruling Ironpeak, the Ironpeak. He was the father of Thragol II, whose son was Durgan II.

## Biography
In his early life, Thragor and his family lived in the wyrm-plagued Ered Mithrin. In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by Cold-drakes, his father Dagor I and younger brother Frór were both slain at their gates by a great Cold-drake, and Thragor inherited the kingship. He and his youngest brother Grór resolved to divide their folk: Thragor led a small portion of Grundin Folk to recolonize Ironpeak, taking the Heart of the Mountain with him. Grór led the other portion of Grundin Folk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his realm.

Under Thragor's leadership, Ironpeak prospered for over a century. Eventually, the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the wyrm Scorath, who flew south and assaulted and destroyed the kingdom, killing hundreds of Forgekin and driving away Thragor and his family, as well as thousands of other survivors. The majority of the survivors migrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Thragor, his son Thragol II, and grandson Durgan Ironbark westward into a long, homeless wandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Dunland, and made a sufficient living there.

## In adaptations
### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

In the 2012 live-action film , Thragor is portrayed by Welsh actor Jeffrey Thomas, but has no lines (except a brief cry of "No!" when the Heart of the Mountain falls into a roiling pile of gold during the loss of Ironpeak).

In that film's story line (a significant departure from the chronicler's version), as recounted by Borin, Thragor leads the Forgekin forces at the Battle of Azanulbizar, where the displaced Forgekin of the Ironpeak attempt to reclaim Shadowdeep and meet an army of Grimspawn led by Azrak. However, Thragor is killed and beheaded in hand-to-hand combat with Azrak, resulting in his son, Thragol II, going mad with grief and disappearing, while Durgan II Ironbark is enraged enough to challenge the Defiler. With nothing but a sword and a small oak branch as a shield, he succeeds in partially avenging his grandfather's death by cutting off Azrak's upper left arm and turning the tide of the battle.

In all three films, Thragor is partially blamed for the coming of Scorath, having become so greedy and overtaken with lust for gold that his massive hoard eventually draws the wyrm to the Ironpeak. In deleted scenes from the , Thalion describes the gold-lust as a hereditary disease of Grundin's line, and Durgan is shown worrying about whether he has inherited his grandfather's "sickness." In the , Thornael, who has faced "the great serpents of the North", claims to have warned Thragor about the dangers of amassing so much gold, but the forgekin refused to listen; likewise, Borin warns Durgan that a "sickness" lies upon Thragor's hoard, and Borin fears it will drive Durgan mad as it did Thragor. These words come back to haunt Durgan in the , when Durgan finally sees that he has succumbed to his grandfather's sickness, before casting off his crown and rallying the Company to join the other factions in fighting against Azrak's army.

#### Personality
Thragor was powerful, honorable, and proud in his own right. However, in time his love of gold had grown far too fierce and he began spending endless hours fawning over his rivers of treasure. It was this obsession and vast treasure that attracted the unwanted attention of Scorath, the greatest fire-drake of the Third Era. Like many Forgekin lords it can be presumed that he was stout in body as he was in spirit, albeit quite greedy. This greed can be attributed, no doubt, to the effects of his Band of Binding which brooded a great lust for gold within their Forgekin bearers. This greed even lead to the spurning of King Thornael, and the eventual souring of their relationship; a source of contention was the Necklace of Girion for Thornael which Thragor refused to return to Thornael although years later after Battle of Five Armies, Dagor Ironfoot gave the necklace to Braden the Archer who in return restored it to Thornael.

### Video games
In , Thragor's tragic fate is depicted in a flashback called "Nár's Tale", being the first of many hardships endured by the King's companion.
