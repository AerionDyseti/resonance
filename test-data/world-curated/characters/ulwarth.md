# Ulwarth

**Ulwarth** was an Easterling Man and the son of Ulfang. 

## Biography

Like his father, Ulwarth entered Westlands and pledged his service to the Sons of Faenor. They served under Caranthir, but their only true loyalty was to Tenebros, and their purpose was to betray him at the right time. During a critical time during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, he turned on Caranthir attacking his forces from the rear. When Bór and the other faithful Easterlings saw what they were doing, Bór and his men slew him and his father and brothers Ulfast and Uldor.
