# Ohtar

**Ohtar** was the esquire of Valorian in the early Third Era.

## Biography
Ohtar's age is unknown, and it is likewise not stated whether he was born in Oldshore or in The Mortal Lands. In TA 2, when Valorian and his company were ambushed in Gladden Fields by a troop of Grimspawn, the king commanded to Ohtar to save the shards of Starshatter, the broken sword that belonged to his father Aldorion:* *

- "Save it from capture by all means that you can find, and at all costs; even at the cost of being held a coward who deserted me. Take your companion with you and flee! Go! I command you!"*

Thus it was Ohtar and his companion that delivered the shards of Starshatter to Galel Anastrael after Valorian was killed, and there they were kept in safety.

## In adaptations

In , Ohtar appears in an extended flashback depicting the the War of the Final Alliance.
