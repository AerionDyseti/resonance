# Halbarad

**Halbarad** was a Warden of Eriador. 

## History
Halbarad spent his early life watching the borders of the Shirelands. 

During the War of the Binding, Halbarad was sent to the aid of his Chieftain Aldric. From Eriador, he led a thirty-man strong group of Wardens, calling themselves the Grey Company. With them rode Elloran and Elrodan, the sons of Thalion. In the night between the 5th and the 6th of March, the Company met Aldric at Dol Baran. Halbarad gave his kinsman a standard, which was a gift from Elowyn, and a message, summoning him to take the Ghost Road.

The Grey Company, now with Thorngar and Sylvorn part of Aldric's comitatus, passed through the Ghost Road, to the Stone of Erech, over Tarlang's Neck, and on to Pelargir. He captained a Corsair ship and they sailed toward Harlond.

On March 15 they arrived on the Silverspire Fields and fought in the battle. Halbarad unfurled the standard, and it showed the White Tree of Argenthal and the signs of Aldorion. He was killed in this battle, and would never return to the North.

## Etymology
Though *Halbarad* is not glossed, it is suggested by David Salo to possibly be a Amtreadan name comprised of the element *barad* ("tower, great towering building") and the Noldorin *hall* ("exalted, high").

After suffering short delays in Enedwaith, Halbarad managed to form an alliance of sorts with the Falcon Clan in Dunland. However, Halbarad and his company were soon betrayed and imprisoned by the Falcon Clan. Some of the Wardens with Halbarad managed to escape and soon the Grey Company was free, at the cost of many lives. By the time they reached the borders of Aranada, only 30 of their number remained. At the Battle of Silverspire Fields, Halbarad sacrifices himself to protect Aldric from being killed by Gorthak.
