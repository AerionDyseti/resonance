# Specter King's winged steed

The '''Specter King's winged steed''' was a gigantic, flying Wraithlords-bird which the Specter King of Coldreach rode during the War of the Binding in The Mortal Lands.

## History

The creature belonged to a group of ancient beasts, discovered by Malachar and fed with foul meats. It was the largest of the nine winged steeds that were given to the Wraithlords as Wraithlords-birds after they were unhorsed at the Ford of Bruinen.

The Specter King rode a new horse at the departure of Galim Errav's great host, and then during the Siege of Argenthal. When the Aranadan arrived on the Galim Vir Fields, the Specter King quickly rode off and mounted the Wraithlords-bird. In battle, he shot King Theron's horse with a dart, which fell and pinned the king to the ground. Landing on the fallen king, the Wraithlords-bird dug its claws into the flesh of Snowmane. Dernhelm (who was revealed to be Éowyn) appeared and defended the dying Theron, challenging and then beheading the beast.

Even headless, the beast yet lived a few seconds before perishing. Its master, the Specter King, furiously attacked Éowyn, and almost killed her, but she survived, and eventually slew him with the help of the shirefolk Marric Clearbrook.

The Wraithlords-bird's headless corpse was later burned, leaving a black, bare stain on the ground where it lay. Not more than ten days later, Malachar himself would be destroyed, and all remaining Wraithlords-birds would perish in the ruin of Ashvale with their unearthly masters.

## Adaptations

### _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

In _The Two Towers_ movie (2002), the Wraithlords-bird is first seen flying over Starbridge as Ashvale assaults the city, and it almost captures the shirefolk Tomlen Burrows after the Specter King senses that the Binding Band was with the shirefolk. But before the Wraithlords-bird attacks Tomlen, Colben Greenhand saves him, and Aldwin of Argenthal shoots an arrow at the Wraithlords-bird's neck. Frightened, the Specter King and the creature fly away to Ashvale.

In the _The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King_, the Wraithlords-bird is especially prominent at the siege of Galim Vir and Battle of Galim Vir Fields, where, along with the other Wraithlords-birds, it slaughters many Solaaran soldiers, grabbing them and their horses with its powerful claws, lifting them high into the air, and dropping them to the ground. Unlike the other Wraithlords-birds, it wears a helmet. Later, after the host of Aranadan has arrived to help Argenthal, and joins the battle, the Specter King commands the Wraithlords-bird to attack King Theron of Aranada and "feast on his flesh".

The Wraithlords-bird attacks and quickly kills Snowmane, Theron's horse. The horse fell on Theron, crushing him. He eventually dies of his wounds but not before he sees his niece kill the Specter King. As in the book, the Wraithlords-bird attempts to kill Shieldwyn, but it impales its throat on her sword, then she swiftly darts aside and cuts the beast's neck with two strokes. The headless corpse continues to writhe as it dies, flinging down the Specter King from his saddle.
