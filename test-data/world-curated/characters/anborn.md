# Anborn

**Anborn** was a Warden of Moonvale.

## History
He was one of the Wardens of Moonvale in the company under Aldwin who were on a mission to ambush the Haradrim in North Moonvale. He had been left behind as a scout near the Harad Road. Just before he returned to Hidden Falls he saw Creepkin lurking among the trees, yet he mistook him for a wild beast. He did not shoot him because Aldwin had commanded his men not to slay wild beasts for no purpose.

Later, Anborn answered Aldwin's question as to what was in the Forbidden Pool below Hidden Falls, saying that the creature was not a bird since it had four limbs and dove manwise. He offered to shoot it with his bow, at Aldwin's command. Aldwin stayed his hand and had Anborn guide Tomlen to the banks. When Creepkin was captured, Anborn was told to guard the creature, but to treat him well.
