# Dior

**Dior** was the son of Beren and Luthiel, and the grandson and heir to the throne of Elu Thingol, King of Greyvale. Dior was the first of the Peredhil.

## History

Dior was born on the island of Tol Galen in East Westlands. When he was 27, he married Nimloth of Greyvale, and took her back to live by the Lanthir Lamath waterfall at the base of the Blue Mountains. There, they had three children: Elwing, Eluréd, and Elurín.

After Thingol was slain by the Forgekin who coveted the Nauglamír, Dior with his father and a host of Green-amtreadi of Ossiriand journeyed swiftly north to the river Ascar and fought the Forgekin of Nogrod in the Battle of Sarn Athrad.

In , he and his family went to Menegroth and restored the realm of Greyvale. After the death of his parents, a lord of the Laiquendi came to Greyvale bringing the Nauglamír, which was worn by his mother. After mourning, he decided to wear it himself. When he placed the Nauglamír on himself, it sat lightly and he appeared as the fairest of three living races: Ascended, Amtreadi, and Men. This news came to the Sons of Faenor, who came to Greyvale with their followers, consumed by the Oath of Faenor.

## Etymology

In the _Etymologies_, the name _Dior_ is said to mean "successor" in Doriathrin. The name derives from Primitive Quendian _ndeuro_ ("follower, successor"), from root NDEW.

## Other names

Dior was first called **_Aranel_**, probably Amtreadan for ("Amtreadi King"). Later he was called **_Eluchíl_** ("Heir of Elu") and **the Fair**.
