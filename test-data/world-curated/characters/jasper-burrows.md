# Jasper Burrows

**Jasper Burrows** was a Shirefolk who lived in The Shirelands during the final years of the Third Era. His adventure with the forgekin Durgan and Company earned him a fortune, and brought the Binding Band of Malachar back into knowledge.

## Personality

Before his adventures, Jasper was considered a very prim and respectable Shirefolk for his polite disposition and aversion to anything out of the ordinary. He had strict culinary and hygienic principles, being often less than thrilled with the rough conditions of travel at first. But, being the son of Bungo Burrows and Belladonna Ashford, Jasper had blood from two important Shirefolk families, the Burrowses and the Ashfords. Because of his adventurous "Tookish side" (which sometimes conflicted with his stay-at-home "Burrows side"), Burrows was rather restless and "strange" for a Shirefolk. After his return from Ironpeak, he was regarded much less fondly than before by his fellow Shirefolk, but paid them no mind. Though considering himself happily retired from adventures, he often left his home for many days to meet with old friends and strangers, including Forgekin.

Jasper was noteworthy as the first band-bearer in the history of The Mortal Lands to give up the Binding Band voluntarily; he surrendered the ring to Tomlen Burrows at Valdris's request.

## History

### Early life

Jasper Burrows was born on September 22 by Shirelands Reckoning, in the year of the Third Era, the son of Bungo Burrows and Belladonna Ashford. He was a grandson of the Old Ashford. about Dragons, Goblins and princesses and was impressed by the Wizard's fireworks. Jasper also saw the Fell Winter, and was the last shirefolk by the End of the Third Era to remember it. His role in the Winter is unknown. After the death of his parents, respectively in and , he inherited Burrow's End. In the eyes of his neighbours, he originally seemed just like his father, a solid, sensible, unadventurous and respectable shirefolk. But when becoming older he started to become "strange" and often left his home for many days to meet with strangers, including Forgekin.

Eventually, Valdris came to believe that Jasper was the ideal person for an important task he had at hand, for Jasper was both small-sized and adventurous. Valdris came to the Shirelands to visit him in but he had disappeared again because of Amtreadi new year. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.

#### Over the Misty Mountains

The next day the company left Galel Anastrael

When Jasper's consciousness returned he picked up a strange golden ring. After wandering through the dark passages he came to the lake of Creepkin. Creepkin, desiring to eat the shirefolk but not willing to face his blade, engaged in a riddle contest. If Jasper won, according to the predetermined rules, Creepkin would lead him to safety. If Creepkin won, Jasper would allow himself to be eaten. As Jasper saw no other way to escape, he agreed with Creepkin's proposal.

Jasper won the contest by accident, wondering out loud as he fingered the ring he had picked up, "What have I got in my pocket?" Creepkin mistook this for a question, and Jasper decided to stick to it. Creepkin lost, but went back to his little island to take the ring Jasper had picked up (as it was a magic ring) to turn himself invisible and kill the shirefolk anyway. But of course the ring was not there, and Creepkin, enraged, suddenly guessed that Jasper had it. He chased Jasper, but Jasper unwittingly used the ring and escaped his notice. Creepkin led Jasper to the eastern door of the goblin-tunnels, through which Jasper departed in safety.

The company had not journeyed long when they heard the howl of a Shadowwolf. On Valdris's order they climbed in a group of trees. Jasper, however, was not able to climb in one of the trees: Jasper did not enjoy his experience being carried by his rescuers, apparently suffering from a fear of heights.

Later, a spider attacked Jasper, who had fallen asleep. Jasper woke up in time to defend himself with his little blade. He named his blade _Glimmer_ after his first kill. Jasper discovered that his companions had been captured by the spiders and stowed in their webs. Calling the spiders' names, he lured them away (with his ring) and came back to rescue the Forgekin. When the spiders returned, the forgekin fought them in a long battle. Eventually, the company won with no serious injuries, but found out that Durgan was missing. Unknown to Jasper and the other Forgekin, he had been captured by the Wood-amtreadi whose feasts they had interrupted.

Later, exploring the amtreadi halls with the aid of his magic ring, Jasper discovered that Durgan was also captured by Thornael and devised a plan for the forgekin to escape. One day, Galion (Thornael's butler) and the head of the guard, were drunk, and Jasper was able to steal the keys. He freed the Forgekin from their cells and packed them in barrels. His plan worked, with the forgekin being packed and launched into the Forest River. Poor Jasper was forced to cling to the barrels, invisible, and grew cold and wet.

#### Encounter with the Dragon

On their way again, the party came to the Ironpeak when autumn waned. Durgan sent Borin, Fíli, Kíli and Jasper to spy the Front Gate. Jasper saw smoke coming out of the front gate, which made the party assume that Scorath was still alive. They returned to their camp and at Jasper's suggestion they started to search for the Back Door at the western slopes of the Ironpeak. Eventually, the company discovered the back door. But none of them were able to open it, and Jasper sat for days on the doorstep, thinking. Soon the forgekin began to grumble about the shirefolk, but Jasper finally solved the riddle of the thrush knocking at the last light of Grundin's Day:

The forgekin found that he was right, and with the key managed to open the passage.

Valdris had indeed done well in choosing Jasper, for the old worm did not recognise Jasper's scent, neither could see him, and was puzzled. Nevertheless he sensed the shirefolk's presence, and challenged him. Knowing that it would be unwise to reveal his true name or stay quiet, Jasper replied with a series of riddles, which no dragon can resist puzzling out. Jasper gave himself a series of names such as "Ringwinner" and "Luckwearer", referring to his adventures on the way to the Mountain. Becoming pleased with his riddling, one of the names Jasper conferred upon himself was "Barrel-rider", and flattered the wyrm:

Meanwhile, in the Ironpeak, Jasper and the forgekin decided to inspect the hoard while Scorath was away. During this time Jasper stumbled across a gigantic and beautiful gem. Recalling an earlier conversation, Jasper realised that it was the famous Heart of the Mountain, but felt strangely reluctant to give it up. Instead, he put it in his pocket and continued on. After a song and gathering of treasure, Durgan gave Jasper a beautiful coat of _truesilver_ as the first reward for his services. Durgan led the party to the front gate, and then Borin led them to the guardroom, where they sheltered.

After Jasper and his companions awoke the next morning they found that many birds, including the aforementioned Trush, assembled at the Ironpeak. Although the Thrush tried to say something to the company, none of them could understand him. Therefore the Thrush summoned the raven Roäc, who was able to speak Common Tongue. Roäc told Jasper and the forgekin about the events in Lake-town and told Durgan about the approaching armies. He counselled them to make peace with Braden and Thornael, though it cost them dearly in gold. Durgan rejected this advice and announced that he would not share the treasure with anyone. Then, Durgan sent Roäc as a messenger to his cousin Dagor, lord of the Iron Hills, to request aid. The next days they made preparations and blocked the gate with a wall, while they received news from the ravens.

#### The Battle of Five Armies and return journey

When Braden and Thornael came to the Front gate, Durgan harshly responded in polite words to Braden. Braden's reasoning did little for the stubborn King under the Mountain and Durgan rejected Braden's proposal to share the treasure.

Occasionally he received strange visitors; forgekin or Valdris, or he often left the Shirelands for journeys from time to time. Other shirefolk looked at him with amazement and suspicion, but his generous and kind nature put him high in the regard of those who knew him best especially the poorest and less significant shirefolk.

Despite his health and youthfulness, Jasper himself began to feel _stretched_ and thin. As time passed and he used his magic ring (and perhaps because of Malachar's growing power), his mind was preoccupied with it, often worrying if it is safe and checking on it; once he tried locking it somewhere but he couldn't relax if it wasn't in his pocket, and wanted to use it more often. Sometimes he felt it like "an eye" watching on him. The next year he visited Galel Anastrael and became a guest of Thalion and apparently he met Calendor once more again around there.

### End of the Third Era

He lived a very pleasant life of retirement in Galel Anastrael: eating, sleeping, writing poetry, and working on his memoir, _There and Back Again_ and wrote a book called _Translations from the Amtreadan_.

When Tomlen came to Galel Anastrael seventeen years later, they reunited in the Hall of Fire. While alone, Jasper mentioned his old ring to Tomlen, wishing to see it, but Tomlen refused and a shadow fell upon the two. Jasper briefly turned into a fleshy figure, though he quickly apologized. Shortly afterwards Jasper finishes composing (with Aldric; whom he calls the _Dúnadan_) the _Eärendillinwë_.

Jasper attended the Council of Thalion, offering to take the Band to Doomfire Peak. Nevertheless, this task fell to the younger Tomlen, and in farewell Jasper gave him Glimmer and his old _truesilver_ coat, both of which served Tomlen well in the struggles to come.

The War of the Binding was fought far from where Jasper dwelt, but successfully, and in the end Tomlen returned home. Because of the Band's destruction, that prolonged his life, Jasper started ageing again; as Elowyn told to Tomlen later, Jasper started looking ancient according to his kind.

### Passage west

Two years later, however, Jasper as a former ringbearer accompanied Tomlen Burrows, Valdris, and certain Amtreadi to the Mistport, there to take ship for the West, on 29 September, . He had already celebrated his 131st birthday, becoming the oldest Shirefolk in the history of The Mortal Lands. As a mortal, he died in the West.

While sailing west, Jasper composed a last poem looking back on The Mortal Lands in farewell.

## Legacy

Already an eccentric during his life in Willowdale, the disappearance of the "Mad Burrows" was a long-lasting discussion around the Shirelands. Many speculated that he got mad and seeking adventures he found his death in a river or pool, with Valdris being responsible for not letting him settle down. Meanwhile Tomlen, knowing that he is alive and well somewhere, continued to honor Jasper's birthday along with his, every year. or Basso Millbrook) that were taken by the 'wandering-madness', either lost for ever, or returning to remain eccentric and uncommunicable.

Many years after his second "disappearance" he became a fireside-story for shire-children, a legendary figure who used to vanish magically and reappear with bags of treasure.

Colben Greenhand named his tenth child Jasper after his hero.

The keepers of the Red Book who copied and translated it were unwilling to make alterations to Jasper's own text, out of respect for the hero of old, and stuck close to it and its faults. But other later copiers of the Book, based on other notes, wrote the true account on the finding of the Band, resulting to the two differing versions of the story.

### Literary work

- Jasper's will \*_There and Back Again_

## Etymology

Within the legendarium, "Jasper" represents a translation of the original Hobbitish _Bilba_.

It has also been noted by Paula Marmor that Jasper is a kind of Spanish sword deriving its name from Bilbao. The element _bil_ ("sword") is found in some Germanic names (such as _Bilihar_).

According to the _[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]_, a dictionary of Old English, the element _bil_ refers to either a farming or military blade, significant in that it must have two edges. The element _bó_, equivalent to _bá_, means both.

**\*Barrel-rider**, given by himself during his conversation with Scorath, used also by the wyrm.
**\*Burglar**, given by Valdris, which he wrote in Jasper's door.
**\*Clue-finder**, given by himself during his conversation with Scorath. It later became the name of a favourite character of legend who would vanish with a bang and a flash, only to reappear with bags of jewels and gold.
**\*Mr. Lucky Number**, given by Scorath.

\**1971: *Sagan om Ringen\* (1971 film):'''
:Jasper hosts an 111th birthday party at The Shirelands. He dines with Valdris, Tomlen, Sam and Marric. During the party, he dissapears, using The Binding Band. The Narrator then recounts that Jasper gifted Tomlen the Band as a birthday present. Later, in Galel Anastrael, Jasper tells of his journey and discovery of the Binding Band. Jasper tells that he discovered the curious properties of the Band and begun to understand that it was The One. On the morning following the Council of Thalion, Jasper gifts Tomlen his sword, Glimmer, and his Truesilver-coat, noting that it is strong enough even to deflect the knives of The Shadow Riders, despite its light weight. After Tomlen puts it on, Jasper remarks that he looks like a true Shirefolk. Before the Company of the Band departed, Tomlen and Jasper huddle in a cloak on the stairs to conserve heat. As the Company departs, Jasper wishes them good luck.

:The voice of Jasper Burrows is provided by Marián Labuda.

This is portrayed as Jasper reading from and commenting on the War of the Binding while writing new chapters in the Red Book of Westmarch. There is a slightly metafictional or postmodern tone to Jasper's narration, as he occasionally breaks the fourth wall and addresses his nephew Tomlen (and sometimes other characters from the Company) directly, with Tomlen or the other characters sometimes equally breaking the fourth wall and briefly responding to Jasper. Until his journey to the Mistport at the end of the story, Jasper spends almost its entirety in Galel Anastrael (from where he narrates and writes the Red Book and notes for it). The prologue about shirefolk and the events of his 111th birthday are briefly summarized by Jasper at the start of the first episode and then the action shifts towards Tomlen and Valdris, and then to Tomlen and his three shirefolk companions.
