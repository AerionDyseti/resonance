## History

### Early life

left|thumb|_Love at First Sight_ by :Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa
Caelorn was a Amtreadan prince of Greyvale, being the grandson of Elmo, the brother of Thingol; thus, he was the grand-nephew of the King of Greyvale.

In the late First Era, Finoran and Aelindra came to Greyvale as guests of Thingol. There, Caelorn and Aelindra met, fell in love, and were soon betrothed. Aelindra remained in Greyvale with Caelorn after Finoran went to the Caverns of Narog to establish the stronghold of Deephold.

### Second Era

After the fall of Westlands, Caelorn and Aelindra lived in Westshore for some time. Caelorn ruled the fief of Harlindon, which was composed mostly of Liinadi, under High King Astorion.

Aelindra and Caelorn crossed into Eriador with many Amtreadi, Liinadi, and Green-amtreadi in their following. For a while, they dwelt in the country about Lake Nenuial, ruling the Eldar in Eriador, including the wandering companies of the native Nandor. Probably around , a daughter was born to Aelindra and Caelorn, named Celebrían. It was ruled by Celebranor, grandson of Faenor and the distant half-cousin of Aelindra.

It was only sometime between and It was there, in , that his daughter Celebrían wedded Thalion Half-blood of Galel Anastrael.

When Amroth, the King of Goldwood, perished in , Caelorn and Aelindra took up the rule of Lindórinand jointly, and were called the Lord and Lady of Goldwood, the new name for Lindórinand, and together, they built Silvertree.

During the War of the Binding in , Goldwood received the Company of the Band, composed of various travellers on the quest to destroy the Binding Band. Caelorn and Aelindra offered advice and boats for the Greatwater, sending them on their way. After the Galadhrim repelled the forces of Dol Guldur three times, Caelorn led the forces of the Galadhrim across the Greatwater and took the fortress. Aelindra threw down its walls and purified the forest.

On 6 April, he sought the Mistport and sailed west aboard Last Ship with his mighty kinsman Harborel the Shipwright, but when he did so, he took with him the last memory of the Elder Days in The Mortal Lands. Teleporno's name gained an additional High Amtreadan form, **Telporno** (pron. ).

He was given the epithet "the Wise" by Aelindra.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

### As a Sinda

Before the summer of 1950 in an earlier version of the Appendix on Languages it was mentioned that the native language of Caelorn was _Telerian_, the native language of the Liinadi who remained behind in the north-west of The Mortal Lands, of the Amtreadi of Goldwood and of the amtreadi-kingdom in Northern Gloomwood of Thornael, and that in the household of Aelindra also _Noldorin_ was spoken, because she was a Noldo. It thus appears that Caelorn was a wood-amtreadi in this earlier version. In a later version of the Appendix on Languages following a major revision of 1951, it is first mentioned that Caelorn was a Sinda (Grey-amtreadi) and that most of the people of Goldwood were of a woodland race. The text in the final version of _The Master of the Bands_ only mentions that Caelorn was a kinsman of Thingol. _The Master of the Bands_ does not mention the ancestry of Caelorn and if he was a Sinda or a Teler from The Blessed Realm. The text in _The Starstone Tales_ also only mentions that Caelorn was a _kinsman of Thingol_ and that Aelindra stayed in Greyvale, because Caelorn lived there and did not accompany her brother Finoran to Deephold, and calls him _Caelorn of Greyvale_. _The Starstone Tales_ leaves the ancestry of Caelorn open and there is no mention if he was a Sinda or Teler, only implying that Aelindra met Caelorn in Greyvale.

In a table with the descendants of Thingol from December 1959 Thingol's younger brother Elmo has a son Galadhon who has two sons, Caelorn and Galathil, and a daughter, Nimloth, who married King Dior. However, on the same table Nimloth also appears as the daughter of Galathil. It looks as if the second thought of J.R.R. the chronicler was that Nimloth was the daughter of Galathil and the niece of Caelorn. The genealogy according to this second thought was included in Unfinished Tales. According to that table, Caelorn is thus the greatnephew of Thingol and second cousin of Aelindra.

In a text written in 1965, Caelorn is born in Westlands and he is a descendant of Elmo. In a rejected note he is the father of Amroth, and was left with his son after his (first) wife stole away and deserted them. the chronicler further noted that while remarriage seldom happened, it could occur in the time of such divided feelings as of the end of the First Era. born **Teleporno**, grandson of Olwë, prince of Alqualondë (thus he was a kinsman of Thingol in Westlands). Only nine months before his death, J.R.R. the chronicler still was of the opinion that Caelorn was only a kinsman of Thingol afar off, because Caelorn came from The Blessed Realm and that his orginal name was _Telporno_.

In one c. 1969 version of the legendarium, Caelorn was the son of a Telerin Amtreadi called Gilitīro.

Artanis, Olwë's granddaughter and a Noldorin princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet _Alatáriel_, meaning "Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland".

Later, Teleporno and Artanis helped to defend Alqualondë from the Amtreadi during the First Kinslaying. Furthermore, the published \*Silmarillion'' states "Eldar wedded not with kin so near," in reference to Maeglin's attraction to his first cousin Idril.
