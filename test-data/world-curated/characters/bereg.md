# Bereg

**Bereg** was a man of the House of Bëor.

## Biography

Bereg, the grandson of Baran through Baranor, Baran's youngest son, was dissatisfied with Estolad, and so he in about FA 369 led a thousand men of the House of Bëor away southwards out of Westlands, disappearing from the histories. It is possible some of his descendants were the ancestors of the later Men of Eriador.
