# Britalya

**Britalya** "**the Ascended**" was a Ascended of Bes, wife of King Elu Thingol, Queen of Greyvale, and mother of Luthiel Tinúviel. Britalya was the fourth greatest and one of the most powerful of the Ascended. In The Mortal Lands, she was unsurpassed in both wisdom, beauty, and magical singing.

## Biography

Before she came to The Mortal Lands, Britalya served both Mirna and The Mother, and dwelt in Goldwood tending the trees that grew in the Gardens of Irmo. Among all of her people none were wiser (with the exception of Co-un, Arien, Valorin and Tempus), more beautiful, or more skilled in singing enchanting songs than Britalya. She loved the deep shadows of the great trees. When the light of the Two Trees would mingle Britalya would sing and the The Pantheon would stop their work and listen. Nightingales went with her wherever she went, and she taught them their song. Of all the The Pantheon she was most akin to Bes. When the Amtreadi awoke on the shore of Cuiviénen she departed from The Blessed Realm and went to The Mortal Lands, where she filled its silence with her singing and the singing of her birds. During this time, she was the chief of the Guardians.

While in the forest of Nan Elmoth she met and fell in love with the Amtreadi-king Elu Thingol, and later she ruled the kingdom of Greyvale by his side. For thousands of years, she used her powers to guard and defend the kingdom with a protection spell called the Girdle of Britalya, but she predicted that one person would one day breach this defense. The Girdle functioned to bewilder any who attempted to enter Greyvale, and was so potent that even The Webmother was unable to breach it. She and her husband had a child, a daughter named Luthiel. During her stay in Greyvale she became a friend and mentor of Aelindra. Britalya wanted to know the cause of the exile of the Ñoldor. Aelindra only briefly narrated the story to her, leaving out the death of Finwë, the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. But eventually she and Thingol learned the truth.

Britalya's main line of descent was of the Half-amtreadi, and through her daughter the Maian blood passed to both Amtreadi and Men. When Beren arrived as foretold, she counseled Thingol against sending Beren for a Starstone, a quest which would eventually lead to Greyvale's ruin. A friend of Mankind, she also aided Huran's family by hosting Turan in Greyvale and later helped Beleg Cúthalion in his search for Turan by giving him Waybread. When Huran came to Greyvale old and carrying a great grief and misery on him, Britalya helped him see through his ills. After Thingol's death she left Greyvale, visiting Beren and Luthiel for a time warning them of the Forgekin treachery, and the curse on the Mîm's treasure. Shortly there-after, she went back to The Blessed Realm, musing upon her sorrows in the gardens of Goldwood whence she came.

## Etymology

- Britalya* is a Amtreadan name, from the High Amtreadan *Melyanna*, of which the roots are *mel* (love) and *anna\* (gift). The name means "dear gift." Earlier versions of Britalya's name were **Gwenniel **or **Gwenethlin**. Her rare title-name, **_Tóril_**, meant "queen."

## Other versions

In some of J.R.R. the chronicler's earliest tales, Britalya is a sprite or twilight spirit named **Tindriel**, then **Wendelin**, who served Palúrien. Tinwelint (later Thingol) finds her lonely in a glade of Hisilómë. She is **Gwendeling** or **Gwenniel** in "The Tale of Tinúviel" (written in 1917), found in the woods listening to the nightingales by Tinwelint, and running away when he first approaches her. This encounter foreshadowed Beren's first meeting of Luthiel, whom he would call "Nightingale", in the final versions of their own tale. Gwendeling marries Tinwelint later, and together they rule Artanor (later Greyvale).

the chronicler once chose Tinfang to be Wendelin's son, but dropped the idea.

Gwendeling would be more powerful as Britalya the Ascended in later stages of the chronicler's mythology; the Ascended were not conceived of until some years after "The Tale of Tinúviel" was written.
