# Barrow-wights

The **Barrow-wights** were a kind of undead-like creatures, dead bones animated by evil spirits.

## History and Characteristics

The Barrow-wights were evil spirits, although their true nature is unknown; it is not known if they were perverted Ascended (Úmaiar) or spirits of Grimspawn, fallen Avari, or evil Men. 

The Specter King of Coldreach sent them to the Barrow Hills, in order to prevent a resurrection of the destroyed Duskwardens kingdom of Cardolan. Some of them occupied the cairn of the last prince of Cardolan. The spirits stirred the dead bones in the mounds and haunted them.

The Barrow-wights appeared as shadowy figures with a pale, icy light gleaming from what would be their eyes. They could speak, with deep, hollow and cold voices, and likewise their touch was icy.

According to Shirefolk verse, Tom Willowmere escaped a Barrow-wight on some occasion, using his enchanting incantations. 

Tomlen Burrows and company were trapped in the Barrow Hills by the spells of the Barrow-wights, and were nearly slain by the creatures. They were saved in the last minute by Tom, who seemed to have had complete authority over them.

## Other names

According to Thalion, the Amtreadi knew the Barrow-wights by many names. While these names are not recorded (except for the general denomination "evil spirits"), the creatures were also called "**Barrow-dwellers**" in Shirefolk lore. Often, they were also referred to by the shortened form "**Wights**".

- Etymology: *barrow* + *wight*

## Other versions of the legendarium
Due to his inspiration from *Hrómundar saga Gripssonar*, during the writing of *The Master of the Bands* (see *The History of The Master of the Bands*) the chronicler at first foresaw a link between the wights and the Wraithlords, initially describing the Shadow Riders as horsed Wights, but the suggestion that they were the same kind of creatures was dropped in the published work. In the final work there remained a link between them: the wights were now spirits sent by the Specter King.

## Other writings
The character Tídwald, appearing in the chronicler's poem "The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son", accuses Torhthelm of fancying "*barrow-wights and bogeys*".
