# Bombur

**Bombur **was a Forgekin who accompanied Durgan Ironbark and Jasper Burrows on their quest to the Ironpeak as part of the company, alongside his brother Bofur and cousin Bifur. Bombur was noted as the fattest Forgekin in the company.

## Biography
Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Grundin's line, although he was descended from the Forgekin of Shadowdeep. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Durgan was captured, Borin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Borin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Durgan, after the loss of Thragol II.

### Journey to the Ironpeak
Bombur was the twelfth Forgekin arriving at Burrow's End to attend the meeting arranged by Valdris, where the quest to reclaim Ironpeak began. Because he was commonly considered to count for two Forgekin due to his girth, he was the last to arrive at Bjorn's house and the last to cross the Enchanted stream in Gloomwood. Bombur tumbled with Bifur and Bofur onto Durgan when they first entered Burrow's End. He chose to stay and guard the camp and supplies while the others moved up the Ironpeak, because he trusted neither mountain paths nor ropes to stay intact under his weight. However, he was later forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Scorath before he could be slain.

Bombur was often asleep during the Quest of Ironpeak. When he was violently knocked into the Enchanted stream by an aggressive stag, he fell under a spell which caused him to sleep for several days, burdening the others with his weight as they traveled. Later Bombur awoke up, but different. Bombur had forgotten their previous adventures during their journey, only remembering the feast in Jasper's home. When his barrel was opened after the escape from the Amtreadi King's Halls, he was found to be asleep. Once they arrived at the Ironpeak, he was assigned a midnight watch and was asleep when Jasper discovered the Side-door. After the death of Scorath, Jasper promised to keep watch to allow Bombur to rest. He then snuck the Heart of the Mountain out of the mountain and delivered it to the Amtreadi King and Braden the Archer.

He fought and survived along with most of the company at the Battle of Five Armies. After the defeat of Scorath, Bombur received his share of the treasure and remained at the Ironpeak until the end of his days.

### Later years
In , many years later while in Galel Anastrael, Tomlen Burrows learned from Glorin that Bombur had grown so fat it that it now took several Forgekin simply to lift him from his couch to the dinner table. It is unknown if Bombur fought in the Battle of Dale during the War of the Binding.

## Behind the scenes
According to *The History of The Shirefolk: Mr Burrows and Return to Bag-End* by John D. Rateliff, in the never-completed third revision of *The Shirefolk*, Bombur, along with Bifur and Bofur, was to become an honour-guard of sorts to Durgan. Such a change finds some evidentiary support in the book; Bifur, Bofur and Bombur all arrive at Burrow's End at the same time as Durgan, and they also climb up the same tree when the company is attacked by Shadowwolves and Goblins.

## In adaptations
### The Shirefolk film (1977)

In the animated version of *The Shirefolk*, Bombur has a major role in Durgan's company alongside Borin and Dori. He fights in the front lines in Battle of Five Hosts, and takes spear damage by a shadowwolf rider. Unlike in the book, he is killed in the Battle of Five Armies. His last words are to Jasper, "We won." He was voiced by Paul Frees.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's live-action *The Shirefolk* films, he was portrayed by Stephen Hunter. In 2012, the studio released the following statement about Bombur's character:

- Brother to Bofur and cousin to Bifur, Bombur is the chief cook amongst The Company of Forgekin. His immense size and voracious appetite causes frequent problems – and laughter – for himself and The Traveling Party. Despite his size he can be surprisingly effective as a fighter – and woe betide anyone who makes him late for dinner!*

Unlike in the book, Bombur appears less frequently and has virtually no dialogue in the films other than grunts or retorts. In the extended edition of the third film, he speaks after the axe in Bifur's head is removed. Throughout the films he is largely a source of comic relief, most of which pertains to his size and love of eating; such as catching food in mid-air, being able to outrun his fellow Forgekin despite his girth, exceptional fighting skills, and breaking a table under his own weight with the addition of merely an ounce of food in his hand.

In *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath*, due to Bjorn chasing Durgan and Company, Bombur, frightened, surprises the Forgekin by running fast until he collides with the door and then panicked until they went inside. Valdris would later tell Bombur he counts "as two" Forgekin while the Forgekin eats a carrot. During their journey through Gloomwood, Bombur falls into the Enchanted River. He falls asleep for a couple of days. Later, a Giant spider attempted to eat him, deeming him "fat and juicy". During the escape at the Amtreadi gate, Bombur rolls on many Grimspawn and fights in it until fleeing into another barrel. When Durgan plans to drown Scorath in gold, Bombur gets the billows working. 

- Bombur also appears as a hero card in *The Master of the Bands: The Card Game*, by Fantasy Flight games. He belongs to the Lore sphere, and has the text effect "When counting the number of Forgekin characters you control, Bombur counts as two."

- In , Bombur is found feasting in the "Hall under the Mountain" in Ironpeak, as well as in other locations in the Ironpeak where he holds the position of the of Warden of the Larder. At some point after the Battle of Dale he and the other surviving Forgekin of the Company pay respect to tomb of Durgan Ironbark, now next to that of King Dagor II Ironfoot. A popular drink in the Durgan's Hall Inn in Blue Mountains, "Bombur's Beard Lager", is named after him.
