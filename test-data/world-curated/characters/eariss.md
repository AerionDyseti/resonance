# Earissë

**Earissë** was the daughter of Lindo and the wife of Ælfwine, according to the early version of the legendarium associated with *The Book of Lost Tales*. She was the mother of Heorrenda and Hlúdwine.

Earissë only appears in two of the notes in the *Notebook C*,

Nothing else is known about her.

## Etymology
The name *Earissë* is in Qenya, probably being a phonological imitation of the English name ***Edith*** and its Old English form *Eadgyth*. *Eadgyth* consists of the elements *éad* ("riches, prosperity, good fortune, happiness") + *gyth*, a form of *gúð* ("combat, battle, war").

The first element of the name *Earissë* might be *ea(r)/earen(-d)* ("eagle"), the second being *-ssë*, a feminine name ending occurring in several other names in the early legendarium.

An earlier form of the name was *Eadissë*.
