# Bifur

**Bifur** was a Forgekin of the late Third Era. He is best known for being a companion to Jasper Burrows and Durgan II on the quest to regain the Ironpeak, along with his cousins Bofur and Bombur.

## Biography
Whilst he was a descendant of the Forgekin of Shadowdeep, Bifur was not related to the royal House of Grundin. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were driven out of their home in the Ironpeak by the wyrm Scorath, and were forced to live in exile, where the Forgekin warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Durgan II Ironbark to a new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

### Quest of Ironpeak

Answering Durgan Ironbark's Quest of Ironpeak, he went to the meeting at Burrow's End with his cousins Bofur and Bombur, where he played the clarinet. On the quest, he was nearly cooked on a spit by Stonelurks and nearly killed by Goblins, Shadowwolves, Stone giants, Great Spiders, and the wyrm Scorath himself. A valiant and brave warrior, Bifur never gave up, and fought in the Battle of Five Armies with all his strength, killing numerous enemies. In the fallout of the great battle, Dagor II gave him his share of the treasure, and he retired to live at the Ironpeak.

## Development
In the earliest partial manuscript of *The Shirefolk,* much of the dialog later assigned to a few of the Forgekin is more evenly distributed. In the opinion of John Rateliff (author of *The History of The Shirefolk: Mr Burrows and Return to Bag-End*), this streamlining strengthened the story through simplification, but at the cost of relegating some of the Forgekin to obscurity since they barely speak at all. Bifur is one of these "silenced" members of the company. The films expanded on the fact he was "silenced" by saying that an Grimspawn axe embedded in his skull left him inarticulate and only able to communicate in dwarfish and hand gestures, this was used to explain why he did not speak throughout the film. At the Battle of Five Hosts he headbutts an Grimspawn, which results in the axe in his head being ripped out. This allows his speech to return.

According to *The History of The Shirefolk: Mr Burrows and Return to Bag-End* by John Rateliff, in the never completed third revision of *The Shirefolk*, Bifur, along with Bofur and Bombur, were to become something like an Honour-guard to Durgan. Such a change is already supported in several places of the book, including the fact that Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur all arrive at Burrow's End at the same time as Durgan, and that they climb into the same tree as him when the company is attacked by Shadowwolves and Grimspawn.thumb|200x200px|Bifur (1977)

## In adaptations

### *The Shirefolk* (1977 animated film)
In the 1977 Rankin/Bass *The Shirefolk*, the voice of Bifur is provided by Jack DeLeon.

### Peter Jackson's *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

Bifur is played by William Kircher in Peter Jackson's Shirefolk films. The studio released the following statement about Bifur:

- "Born in the West, Bifur has the rusting remains of an Grimspawn axe embedded in his forehead, which has rendered him inarticulate and occasionally feisty! He communicates only​ with Forgespeech and hand gestures [known as Iglishmêk]. Unlike most of the others in The Company of Forgekin, Bifur is not related to Durgan, nor is he of noble lineage, but rather is descended from miners and smithies – simple folk with simple tastes."*

In the extended edition of *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*, Bifur loses the axe in his head when he strikes an attacking Grimspawn with a head-butt and knocks his foe off a cliff, although Bofur and Bombur manage to haul him back to safety. Bombur retrieves the axe-head, but Bifur informs Bombur, "You know where you can stick that?" and throws the axe-head away, confirming that he gained the ability to speak in the Common Tongue.

### Voice dubbing actors

### *The Master of the Bands Online*
In , Bifur lives in Ironpeak during and after the War of the Binding, holding the position of the Keeper of the Hammers. His son Bósi and grandson Bori play a major part in the *Mines of Shadowdeep* expansion in which they lead an expedition to reclaim Shadowdeep on the orders of King Dagor II. Along with his cousin Bofur he appears in the "The Fires of Scorath" instance, which takes place during the Siege of Ironpeak. After the battle Bifur and the other surviving Forgekin of the Company join Dís in paying respect to tomb of Durgan II. When Nori goes on an unauthorized expedition to the Ered Mithrin, his brother Dori recruits his old companions Bofur and Glorin to go after him, but Bifur declines, saying that his adventuring days are behind him.
