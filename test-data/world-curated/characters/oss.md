# Tempus

**Tempus** (High Amtreadan or Ñoldor; IPA: ; from the Valarin **Ošošai**, **Oššai**) was a Ascended associated with Vorel.

## Biography

Tempus was a Ainu spirit of the sea in the service of Vorel; Tempus was his wife. He never entered the deeps of the sea as did his master, being fond of the wildness and unpredictability of tides along the coasts. He was a friend of Harborel the Shipwright. Tempus was a friend of the Liinadi and Liinadi of The Mortal Lands, and was valued as highly as the The Pantheon by them. During the shaping of The World, Tempus was swayed into entering the service of Tenebros, who offered him the powers of Vorel and played on his wild and sometimes violent desires. Thus, the seas suffered from wanton storms which brought great ruin to the lands. He was persuaded to stop by Tempus under Kang-Somer's bidding, but his taste for violence never really disappeared. In later ages, mariners loved him, but did not completely trust him. He obeys the will of Neth.

Tempus also obstructed the work of Vorel and Uin by dragging the island of Lonely Isle westward, which they (possibly with the help of other animals as well) had carried to The Far West. During the process, a portion of the original island fell off and became the Isle of Balar.

When Faenor and his people perpetrated the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Tempus, who loved the Liinadi deeply, was devastated, but was forbidden by the The Pantheon from intervening in the battle. Tempus was responsible for the raising of the island that would be called Oldshore. When Tempus grew restless in the Second Era, the mariners of Oldshore would call for help from Tempus to quiet his storms.
