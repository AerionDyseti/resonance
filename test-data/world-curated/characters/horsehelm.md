# Horsehelm

'*Horsehelm *Éadig'''\* of the House of Eorl was the eighteenth King of Aranada and first of the Third Line. He was the son of Théodwyn, sister of King Theron of Aranada, and Éomund, a Chief Marshal of the Aranada. After he and his sister Shieldwyn were orphaned, Theron adopted them as his own children.

## History

### Youth

Horsehelm was born in as son of Éomund and Théodwyn. When he was eleven years old, his father was slain by Grimspawn raiders in the Stone Hills. His mother fell ill and died soon after. His uncle Theron adopted him and his sister Shieldwyn as his own children and they went to live at Goldenhall.

Horsehelm grew strong and tall and became a valiant and skilled warrior and rider. Theron made him Marshal of the Aranada and he was in command of the East-mark like his father. He had his home at Oldfort in the Folde, one of the oldest towns of Aranada. With his Éored he defended Aranada mainly against Grimspawn from Ashvale. They surrounded them and remained watchful throughout the night. With several small attacks they weakened the troop until another Grimspawn band from Ironspire arrived. The Aranadan defeated them and surrounded the first troop even closer.

With the first light of the new day the Aranadan proceeded to attack. They killed all the Grimspawn and Horsehelm himself slew their leader Uglúk. The shirefolk meanwhile were able to flee into Deeproot Forest.
Fifteen men and 12 horses did not survive the assault. They were buried in a mound encircled with fifteen spears.

On the way back to Horsehold, the Aranadan met Aldric, Thorngar, and Sylvorn. Horsehelm demanded their names and business. Fighting almost broke almost out between them, but Aldric prevented this. He then told Horsehelm his true name and showed him his sword, Dawnblade. Horsehelm now listened to the story of their journey, and learned about the losses of Valdris and Valdric. When Aldric revealed that they had tracked the band of Grimspawn all the way from the Stone Hills in the hope of rescuing the shirefolk, Horsehelm was astonished and gave Aldric the name "Wingfoot", recognizing the difficulty of crossing so much terrain in so little time. He revealed that his men had destroyed the band of Grimspawn, and that it was fruitless to go searching for his friends. He instead urged Aldric to return with him to Horsehold to help the people of Aranada in their need, but Aldric refused and insisted that he be able to continue his search for the shirefolk. Although he was counteracting the law of Aranada by letting Aldric go free, Horsehelm decided to trust him and he even lent him and his companions two horses, Hasufel and Arod, to help them in their search, but he asked them to prove his trust by bringing them back to Horsehold when their search was over.

Upon his return to Horsehold, Horsehelm threatened Verin, but Verin arrested him and accused him of breaking the law because he had pursued the Grimspawn and had allowed strangers to roam freely without Theron's permission.

Horsehelm was released after Valdris healed Theron from the influence of Verin. He was delighted to see that his king was recovering quickly from his weakness. Now Verin's treachery was revealed, but due to Valdris's intervening he was not killed, but rather expelled from the Golden Hall. Theron, now realizing the situation, decided to lead the Aranadan into battle against Morvain instantly. The Three Hunters and Valdris accompanied them when they left Horsehold the same day.

The following day they met the scout Ceorl who had been sent out by Erikbrand to warn Horsehelm. He was surprised to come across King Theron's army riding north and brought news that Morvain had let loose his forces and that the Aranadan had been forced to retreat across the Isen with great losses. These tidings caused Theron to reconsider his strategy. After consulting with Valdris he decided to ride to join Erikbrand at Thornwall Keep while the wizard left them, saying that he would meet them there.

They arrived at Thornwall Keep on the night of 3 March and Horsehelm oversaw the preparations for the great battle. In the middle of the night, the siege began, and when battering rams attacked the gates, Horsehelm and Aldric led a sortie through a passage on the side of the Thornwall that drove the enemies threatening the doors away. In the course of this Thorngar saved Horsehelm's life when he killed two Grimspawn who had ambushed Horsehelm. The battle continued throughout the night and ever more attackers scaled the walls with large ladders. Aldric and Horsehelm had to repeatedly move the defenders, who were getting weary, to repel the Grimspawn. With the help of a device of Morvain's the Grimspawn caused an explosion under the wall that made a wide hole in it. From then on the attackers could not be stopped and the defenders were separated. Horsehelm and Thorngar retreated to the Glittering Caves whereas Aldric and Sylvorn defended the Thornwall.

The battle seemed lost when at dawn Valdris returned with Erikbrand and 1000 riders from the Westmark. Together they drove the enemies out of the deep and into a forest of Huorns that had arrived during the night and from which no Grimspawn returned.
After the end of the battle Horsehelm accompanied his king to Ironspire. There they met Morvain who tried to enthral Theron with his magic voice, but both Horsehelm and Theron saw through him and his dark designs. Theron said that Aranada would have no peace until Morvain and his works had perished. Valdris then broke Morvain's staff and cast him from the Order of Wizards and the Grey Council.

### The Battle of Galim Vir Fields

On 5 March the company set out to Thornwall Keep. While they rested in the night Perrin took the _seeing-stone_ of The Black Tower from the sleeping Valdris, looked in it, and was confronted by Malachar. Knowing the peril Perrin was in, Valdris said farewell to the others and departed with Perrin towards Galim Vir. The Three Hunters and the Aranadan continued their journey towards Thornwall Keep where they arrived on 6 March. Now Aldric looked into the seeing-stone and revealed himself to Malachar. Because of what he glimpsed in the _seeing-stone_, he left the Aranadan, and took the Ghost Road with the Grey Company. Horsehelm was afraid of never seeing him again, but Aldric predicted that they would "meet again, though all the hosts of Ashvale should stand between." before setting out.

Horsehelm accompanied his king to the muster of Darkharrow where he met his sister Shieldwyn again. Then the Red Arrow of Argenthal, which requested Aranada's aid, was brought by a messenger and the Rohhirim set out in great haste to Galim Vir. They used narrow mountain paths and on 13 March reached Drúadan Forest where they met Ghân-buri-Ghân, the chief of the Drúedain. He agreed to lead the Aranadan by a secret road past the Grimspawn hosts that laid siege to Galim Vir.

The Aranadan arrived on the battleground of the Galim Vir Fields at dawn on 15 March. Horsehelm led the first Éored that should follow the king's banner in the centre. The Aranadan were strong and filled with wrath and many enemies were slain. The Aranadan went hither and thither at their will and so Horsehelm was only brought to Theron when the king was already mortally wounded. Before his death Theron hailed Horsehelm as Lord of Aranada and Horsehelm and those who stood by wept. When Horsehelm recognized Shieldwyn lying nearby, a cold fury rose in him and without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of the City he led his men across the field, slaying all enemies in their path. As they charged he shouted out "Death! Ride, ride to ruin and the world's ending!".

But soon fortune turned against Horsehelm and he and his men were encircled. Just in time came the aid of the horsemen of Argenthal, among them Hirluin of the Green Hills and Imrahil prince of Swan Keep. But ever more enemies came from Starbridge, and when the black ships of the Corsairs came up the Greatwater, the battle seemed lost. Horsehelm rallied the Aranadan for a last fight against the Corsairs when he realized the standard of Aldric unfurling on the first ship.

The enemies fled when they saw that their own ships were filled with foes and so Horsehelm met Aldric in the midst of the battlefield as Aldric had predicted.

The battle ended in victory and Horsehelm learned that Shieldwyn was not dead, but lay gravely ill in the Houses of Healing. He also learned that the contact with the Lord of the Wraithlords was not the only reason for her sickness but that also her despair had worsened it. Aldric managed to heal Shieldwyn and she awoke at her brother's call. Marric Clearbrook was also healed and Horsehelm made him a Knight of the Aranada in return for his aid for Shieldwyn and Theron.

The next day, Horsehelm took part in the debate of the Captains of the West. There Valdris told that their hope now lay with Tomlen Burrows and Colben Greenhand, who had gone to Ashvale to destroy the Binding Band wrought by Malachar. Valdris counselled that they should ride to the Obsidian Gate in order to force Malachar to empty his land and take the Shadow Lord's attention away from his search for the Band, giving the Band-bearers their only chance. Aldric agreed and Horsehelm followed his friend in return for his aid in their time of need.

On 18 March the Host of the West, Valdris, the Three Hunters, and Horsehelm among them, set out towards the Obsidian Gate. They fought there on 25 March and withstood the forces of the enemy until the Band was destroyed and Malachar and his servants and works perished.

### Lord of Aranada

After the great victory, Aldric set up his camp on the Field of Cormallen in North Moonvale and Horsehelm took part in the celebrations there.
Together with the other Captains of the West he returned to Galim Vir and attended the coronation of Aldric on 1 May. A week later he renewed the Oath of Eorl for Aldric and both swore everlasting friendship between Aranada and Argenthal. On 8 May he, with his sister, set out to Aranada, for there was much to organize and to set in order.

Horsehelm returned to Galim Vir on 18 July and set out the next day, bringing Theron's body back to Horsehold. On 10 August the funeral of Theron took place

But though Malachar had perished, the King of the West had many enemies to destroy before the White Tree could grow in peace. So Horsehelm often fulfilled the Oath of Eorl and went with King Stonehelm far into the East and South of The Mortal Lands. He was known as **Horsehelm Éadig**, or "the Blessed", because during his reign Aranada recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again. In he wedded Princess Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil of Swan Keep, whom he had met during his stay in Argenthal, and she bore him a son Elfwine the Fair.

He kept his friendship with his knight Marric Clearbrook and when he became Master of Brookshire in , the King sent him great gifts, as did his sister from Moonvale.

In Horsehelm, presumably feeling death coming near him, asked Master Holdwine to visit him one last time. Both Marric and his friend Perrin came to Aranada and stayed with him until the autumn of that year, when King Horsehelm died.), due to his grandmother Morwen Steelsheen, who was of Oldbloods descent.

## Weapon

Horsehelm's sword was called Gúthwinë,

## Etymology

His name is likely derived from the Anglo-Saxon words _eoh_ ("war-horse"), and _mǣre_, ("grand, excellent, famous"). Éo- sounds like "eh-ah" with the "ah" just barely pronounced.

He adopted the epithet _Éadig_ during his kingship, which is an Old English word meaning "happy, wealthy" and usually translated as "blessed", used for saints in medieval literature.
