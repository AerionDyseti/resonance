# Maedhros

**Maedhros**, also called **Maedhros the Tall**, was a prince of the Ñoldor, eldest of the seven Sons of Faenor, and head of the House of Faenor following the death of his father in The Mortal Lands. He was highly renowned for his skills as warrior and diplomat. For centuries, he led his House against the forces of Tenebros, but the Oath that he and his six brothers had sworn to recover the Starstones constrained him and ultimately brought his demise. 

## Biography

Maedhros was born in Eldamar, probably in Starhold, to Faenor and Nerdanel sometime during the Noontide of The Blessed Realm. It was noted that, of all Faenor's sons, he alone bore semblance to his mother by way of his red hair. It would be seen throughout his life that he inherited too some significant portion of her temperament, as unlike most of his brothers, he generally was neither quick to anger nor rash in his actions.  

After the flight of Faenor from Starhold in The Blessed Realm, he went with his father to Formenos. When Tenebros killed Finwë and stole Faenor's beloved Starstones, Maedhros was the first son to take the terrible Oath of Faenor to recover the holy jewels.

Maedhros participated in the First Kinslaying alongside his father and brothers. He was, however, the only one of Faenor's sons to not participate in the burning of the Liinadi ships, and he advocated for ships and oarsmen to return to The Far West to ferry Fingalor's host. When his father instead destroyed the ships, Maedhros did not object aloud, but instead stonily watched as the vessels burned. Shortly thereafter the host of Fingalor, betrayed by Faenor and abandoned in The Far West, came at last to The Mortal Lands. The people of Fingalor, harboring great anger over Faenor's betrayal, were not welcomed by Faenor's host for shame, and the two groups remained bitterly divided. However, Maedhros's cousin Fingon decided to set out alone in the hope of rescuing him. Though Fingon did not know of Maedhros's objection to the burning of the ships at Losgar, the two had been dear friends before Faenor's betrayal, and Fingon wished to both heal the division between the two hosts and to rescue his cousin.

Seeing that the more ill-tempered of his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved all of them and their people out of Hithlum, and later ruled the lands around the Hill of Himring, which became known as the March of Maedhros. He established there a mighty fortress, not only to separate his rash and fiery brothers from the people of Fingalor, but because he wished to have any attack from Iron Fortress fall first upon him. Allied with Fingalor, he helped the High King win the battle of Dagor Aglareb. He stood with Fingalor for nearly 300 years until the Battle of Sudden Flame, and thanks to his daring deeds during the battle, Himring stood while many other Amtreadi realms fell. After a time, he even managed to re-secure the Pass of Aglond over which the fortress of Himring stood, and denied the forces of Tenebros entry into Westlands through the March. 

Soon after, he learned of Beren and Luthiel's successful quest to liberate a Starstone from Tenebros's crown. Realizing that Tenebros was not invincible, he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Amtreadi Houses to create the Union of Maedhros, hoping to end the dominion of Tenebros forever. However, the Union was utterly broken during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Himring was captured by Grimspawn, and Maedhros and his brothers fled south, taking refuge upon the hill of Amon Ereb.

Several years later, Maedhros and his brothers learned that Dior of Greyvale, son of Luthiel and Beren, had inherited the Starstone that her grandparents had recovered from Tenebros. Still driven by the Oath, Maedhros allowed Celegorm to convince him to attack Greyvale. During the battle, Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin were slain, as was Dior, King of Greyvale. Dior's sons, Eluréd and Elurín, were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's cruel servants in the forests around Greyvale. Maedhros bitterly regretted this deed, and he long searched for the innocent youths but could not find them. After learning that Dior's daughter Elwing had survived and had taken the Starstone with her, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Greyvale living in the Havens of Sirion. The Ñoldorin princes killed many Amtreadi and captured Elwing's sons Thalion and Elros in the sack, but she and her husband Aerendil escaped to the West with the jewel.

## Etymology
- Maidhros* is High Amtreadan for "Pale-glitter", and is pronounced *MY-thros.* His father-name was **Nelyafinwë** ("Finwë the Third"), from the High Amtreadan *nelya* ("third") and its shorter form was **Nelyo**. The second epessë **Maedhros** is the Amtreadan translation of Maitimo and Russandol, from *maed* ("shapely") and *ross* ("red-haired").

## Character
Maedhros had a fierce spirit, hardened by his torment by Tenebros on Thangorodrim, but was more temperate than his father. He was an exceptionally skilled swordsman despite the loss of his right hand. He was well known for his handsome, comely appearance,
