## History

## Overview

Judicator Prefect of Lux and pragmatic arbiter. Leverages favors and quiet influence to defuse feuds before they ignite; prefers discretion and results over spectacle. Serves as the party’s primary patron and point of accountability in Keys to Perfection.

Bastien Amun-Ro was born into a minor branch of the Steward Caste in the Solaaran Empire. From an early age, he displayed the meticulous attention to detail and unwavering commitment to order that would define his career. At 15 years old, he tested into the Judicator Caste, where he rose through the ranks of the empire's legal enforcers and earned a reputation for fairness tempered with pragmatism.

Now in the autumn of his years, Prefect Bastien has served the Judicator Caste for over three decades. His position as Judicator Prefect places him as a mediator between the empire's powerful Houses, particularly in matters that might otherwise escalate into destructive feuds. Though he works directly under House Medjay, the Steward Paragon family, Bastien has cultivated a reputation for impartiality that allows him to navigate the complex politics of Solaaran society.

Over the years, Bastien has developed a network of capable individuals who owe him favors—a system he employs when official channels would only complicate sensitive situations. He prefers solving problems quietly and efficiently, avoiding the rigid bureaucracy that might impede practical solutions.

## Personality

Prefect Bastien is a study in controlled weariness—a man who has seen enough of the world to be tired by it, but not enough to become cynical. He speaks with a gentle baritone that belies his authority, preferring straightforward communication over flowery rhetoric. Though he represents the law, he recognizes its limitations and isn't above seeking unconventional solutions when traditional approaches would fail.

He treats others with respect regardless of their station, valuing competence over credentials. Bastien is patient but not indulgent, willing to give second chances but not third ones. His years of service have taught him when to push and when to relent, a wisdom that makes him effective where more dogmatic officials would falter.

Despite his pragmatism, Bastien maintains a core of idealism—a belief that the system, for all its flaws, can still serve the greater good when guided by the right hands.

## Appearance

Prefect Bastien is a man in his early sixties, with close-cropped silver hair and a clean-shaven face weathered by years under the harsh Solaaran sun. His eyes, a deep amber, retain their sharpness despite the crow's feet that frame them. He carries himself with the quiet dignity of one who commands respect without demanding it.

### Notable Characteristics

- Tall and lean with the straight posture of a lifelong civil servant
- Wears simple but immaculate robes of office with subtle gold accents that denote his rank
- Hands bear the calluses of someone who began in more humble positions
- Speaks with deliberate pacing, each word carefully chosen

## Relationships

Bastien has cultivated a complex web of relationships throughout his career, each serving different purposes in his mission to maintain order:

- **House Medjay** - His direct superiors, whom he serves loyally while occasionally working around their more cumbersome protocols
- **Elder Yara Senet** - A respected but demanding Cultivator Paragon whom Bastien has dealt with on multiple occasions
- **The Network** - Various individuals from different walks of life who owe him favors, including adventurers and specialists he calls upon for delicate matters
- **Junior Judicators** - Bastien serves as a mentor to many younger members of his order, teaching them the unwritten rules of effective governance

## Goals and Aspirations

- Maintain peace between the major Houses without resorting to heavy-handed enforcement
- Cultivate a new generation of Judicators who understand both the letter and spirit of the law
- Preserve the stability of the Solaaran Empire through periods of tension and change
- Resolve disputes efficiently before they grow into lasting feuds
- Build a legacy as a fair arbiter who served the greater good rather than rigid doctrine

## Session Role — KtP #1: The Case of the Missing Gyr Falcon

- Commissioned the party to discreetly resolve the falcon theft within two days to prevent a House feud
- Served as neutral arbiter between House Sennet and House Medjay, emphasizing quiet resolution over spectacle
- Intended recipient of the party’s interim report before notifying Elder Yara
