# Belegund

**Belegund** was an Edain man of Dorthonion and one of the XII Bëorings who followed Barahir.

## Biography

Belegund was a son of Bregolas born in Dorthonion in the late First Era. He was the father of Rían, and thus the grandfather of Tuor. He is also the great uncle of Turan. He was among the many Men of Dorthonion that went to war in the Battle of Sudden Flame. After the defeat, Belegund remained with Barahir and his armed band of men refused to surrender or submit to the will of Tenebros, thus they were declared outlaws and hunted to the death. He and the others survived for nearly five years. The outlaw band were eventually betrayed to Malachar by the unhappy Gorlim and he and his company were killed at Tarn Aeluin by Grimspawn.
