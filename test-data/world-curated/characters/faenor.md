# Faenor

**Faenor** was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi, second King of the Amtreadi. It was he who led his people from The Blessed Realm in pursuit of Tenebros after the latter destroyed the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm and stole the Starstones.

He was born in The Blessed Realm, the only child of Finwë (High King of the Ñoldor) and Finwë's first wife Míriel Therindë. He was a craftsman, gem-smith, warrior, maker of the Starstones, and inventor of the Tengwar script. He was also the creator of the Seeing-Stones.

Faenor was said to be the mightiest in all parts of body and mind; countenance, understanding, skill, and subtlety, of all the Children of Ilúvatar. However, his personality was riddled with flaws, foremost among them selfishness and pride. These flaws would lead ultimately to his own downfall, bring his kin untold anguish, and condemn his people to a hopeless war against Tenebros that lasted many millenia after his death.

## Biography
### Early life
[[File:Faenor by LuisFBejarano.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Faenor, by [https://www.deviantart.com/luisfbejarano Luis F. Bejarano] ]]
Faenor was born during the Years of the Trees in The Blessed Realm to Finwë and Míriel. He drew so much of Míriel's life energy when he was born that she grew weary of living and her spirit voluntarily left her body, leaving her family for the Halls of Mandos. After a time, Finwë remarried and had four more children; Faenor's half-brothers Fingalor and Finarfin, and half-sisters Findis and Irimë. Though he loved his father as dearly as a son could, Faenor was not fond of his stepmother Indis nor her children and so lived apart from her and his half-siblings. In his youth, he quickly discovered his outstanding talents for craftsmanship and language. In his youth, he improved upon the work of Rúmil and created the system of writing known as Tengwar, used by the Ñoldor in The Mortal Lands until the Third Era. He also became a student of Mahtan, a great smith who had learned his craft at the feet of Aulë himself. From Mahtan, he learned much of metallurgy, and at some point, he wedded Mahtan's daughter Nerdanel, who bore him seven sons: Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, and Amras. He spent most of his time either alone or with his sons, such that they were all completely loyal to him. In addition to his work as a craftsman, smith, and linguist, Faenor was possessed of exceptional oratory skill, and could persuade virtually anyone through speechcraft. He also was known to have been restless, exploring as much of The Far West as he could and constantly crafting new works. One of these works was believed to have been the seeing-stones.

### The making of the Starstones
By far the greatest of Faenor's crafting achievements was the creation of the Starstones, also called the Great Jewels. To make them, Faenor captured some of the intermingled light from the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm and by unknown means contained it, imperishable, into three large diamond-like gems. His creations garnered him great praise, and he came to prize the Starstones above all else. As time went on however, he began to covet the gems with a greedy love, and he increasingly ignored the fact that the light which lay in the gems and gave them their beauty was not of his own making. Faenor alternated between vainly displaying the jewels and jealously guarding them from all but his immediate family, though eventually he came to the point where they almost always remained under lock and key.

### The wiles of Tenebros
[[File:Faenor by kimberly80-d6lvfsk.jpg|thumb|260px|Faenor, by [https://www.deviantart.com/kimberly80 kimberly80] ]]
After three ages of imprisonment, Tenebros, mightiest of the The Pantheon and the world's primordial source of evil, deceived his fellows with a false show of repentance. Pardoned and residing in The Blessed Realm, his malice had in fact reached hitherto unprecedented levels, and its primary target quickly became the Amtreadi, as it had been for their sake that he had been overthrown. He found that, of the three primary groups of Amtreadi in The Blessed Realm, the Ñoldor were the easiest to manipulate due to their thirst for his knowledge and their willingness to listen. Focusing his efforts solely on the Ñoldor, he subtly spread lies amongst them that, amongst other things, the The Pantheon were keeping them imprisoned in The Blessed Realm so that the race of Men might inherit The Mortal Lands and claim the glory that could have been theirs. Although Faenor mistrusted and feared Tenebros, in his arrogance and impatience he often unwittingly repeated the lies of Tenebros. Faenor quickly became the most prominent of the rebellious Ñoldor, to the point where the other The Pantheon, not knowing of Tenebros's influence, saw him as the source of the Ñoldor's distemper.

Tenebros coveted the Starstones and hated Faenor, but cunningly hid all semblance of his true intentions as the situation continued to deteriorate. Tenebros's influence eventually came to the point where rumors began to circulate amongst some that Faenor's half-brother Fingalor was planning not only to usurp his place as heir to Finwë, but also to seize the Starstones for himself. In his pride and vanity, Faenor took little convincing, and his hostility grew to the point to where he threatened Fingalor with violence. The The Pantheon, having been patient with Faenor's rabble-rousing until that point, could not ignore the transgression of breaking the peace of The Blessed Realm. Faenor was immediately summoned to the Band of Doom to explain himself. Faenor's testimony revealed the malice of Tenebros and his lies, and Tulkas immediately left the Band to apprehend him again. Despite Tenebros having been the true root of the Ñoldor's unrest, Faenor's crime had been of his own making, and for this the The Pantheon exiled him for twelve years' time from Starhold. Faenor went to the stronghold of Formenos and took a substantial treasure with him, including the Starstones, which he put in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë also withdrew to Formenos and renounced the kingship so long as Faenor remained in exile.

Sometime later, Tenebros unexpectedly appeared at Formenos where he tried to sway Faenor to his side, proclaiming that the The Pantheon had treated him unjustly. However, Faenor realized that Tenebros's true goal was to obtain the Starstones, and he vehemently dismissed the fallen Pantheon God. Tenebros left in a rage and fled from The Blessed Realm. Though Faenor thought little of the incident, Finwë was filled with foreboding and reported Tenebros's visit to the The Pantheon immediately. However, they were unable to find so much as a trace of him, and after a time the The Pantheon were forced to give up the search. Seven years later, the The Pantheon announced a great feast at The Blessed Realm with the intention of repairing their relationship with the Ñoldor. Faenor's exile was temporarily rescinded, and both he and Fingalor were invited to attend. Though the The Pantheon had intended for Finwë to come as well, he refused the invitation of the The Pantheon due to Faenor's continued exile and remained at Formenos. During the reconciliatory feast, Fingalor extended a hand to his half-brother and openly recognized Faenor's place as the eldest, but it was returned by Faenor somewhat grudgingly.

### The Flight of the Ñoldor

Faenor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Starstones, named Tenebros "Tenebros", or "Black Foe of the World" (literally "Black Enemy"). Consumed by rage and despair, he fled the Band of Doom. His grief quickly turned to bitterness against the The Pantheon themselves, and he cursed the summons which had brought him away from his father. For in his despair, he believed that had he been present at Formenos when Tenebros had come, he could have saved his father. Realistically of course the summons had saved Faenor, for though Faenor was mighty amongst his people, he was, ultimately, merely an Amtreadi. Indeed, Tenebros had planned on killing both father and son during his break-in at Formenos, for he had possessed no prior knowledge of the The Pantheon's festival and had assumed both would be present. 

Now King of the Ñoldor after the death of his father, Faenor returned to Starhold, ignoring the fact that he was still exiled, and gave one of the most impassioned speeches ever delivered in The World. But due to his rage, grief, and pride, his speech was filled with many of the lies and half-truths of Tenebros. He railed against the Shadow Lord, but he also blamed the The Pantheon in part for Tenebros's deeds, claiming that they should have been able to stop him and had failed. He expounded on his belief that, because Tenebros had attacked and badly marred the kingdom of the The Pantheon without consequence to himself, there was neither bliss nor surety of safety to be found in The Far West any longer. He evoked images of the kingdoms his people could build in The Mortal Lands, and the glory that could be theirs once they regained the Starstones. Faenor then swore an oath by the name of Ilúvatar himself that he would suffer none, no matter their race or reasons, to withhold a Starstone from him, and that he would pursue with violence any who attempted it. The Oath of Faenor was also taken by his seven sons below the tower of the Mindon Eldaliéva in the Great Square of Starhold. This terrible oath became the cause for great tragedy for Faenor's family, and for the Eldar in general. 

His impassioned speech swayed most of those present, but even with his tremendous oratory skill, dissension quickly arose regarding who should lead the hosts to The Mortal Lands. For though Faenor was now High King by right of birth, he was not well liked amongst the Ñoldor, and many of them were not of a mind to accept his rule. Greater love was given to Fingalor and his sons, and most of the Ñoldor desired greatly that Fingalor and his sons should go with them and lead them. Fingalor had little desire to go, but he had sworn to uphold his brother's rights as the eldest, and furthermore he did not wish to leave his people to the mercy of Faenor's rash, self serving tendencies. Additionally, his son Fingon vehemently wished to undertake the journey, and urged his father to come along. Thus against his wisdom, Fingalor would lead a second host, larger and not so eager to leave as Faenor's, while Finarfin would command a third host, the smallest and most reluctant of the three. However even with the sons of Finwë leading the way, about a tenth of the Ñoldor chose simply to stay in Starhold, some for the love of Starhold and others for love of the The Pantheon.

### The First Kinslaying

After delivering his speech and departing with his host, Faenor's mood cooled somewhat, and he belatedly realized that he had no practical means of transporting himself and his people to The Mortal Lands. Though The Mortal Lands and The Far West were connected in those days by the Helcaraxë, a treacherous and bitterly cold region of shifting arctic ice, it was deemed to be effectively impassable. Though Tenebros and the newly empowered The Webmother had sped across it during their escape from The Blessed Realm, even Faenor was not so rash as to believe that the Ñoldor could accomplish any similar feat. He then gave some thought to the building of ships, but knew that there were no shipwrights amongst his people. Even had there been, crafting a fleet large enough to ferry all of the Ñoldor hosts to The Mortal Lands would have been an utterly monumental task. Faenor therefore went to Alqualondë where the seafaring Liinadi lived. He attempted to persuade them to join him in his quest, or failing that, to secure the use of their ships. However, even Faenor's impeccable rhetoric was for naught, as the Liinadi had no desire whatsoever to leave The Far West, and would not be persuaded for any potential glory or adventure. Nor would they give Faenor their ships, for they held them too dearly. Faenor angrily claimed that the Liinadi owed the Ñoldor a debt for instructing them in the arts of crafting buildings and cities. But Olwë, the lord of the Liinadi, was unmoved, and in friendship he urged Faenor not to return to The Mortal Lands.

But Faenor would not take no for an answer. He understood that many of his people had been inflamed by his impassioned words, and knew that haste was essential to keep cooler heads from swaying the Ñoldor to a more reasonable course. As such, he persuaded his host to aid him in taking the ships by force. This he attempted, but the Liinadi resisted, casting many of the Ñoldor into the sea and thrice driving them back despite being far more lightly armed than the Ñoldor. However, Fingalor's host, larger and less eager to undertake the journey, had been slower in departing Starhold than had Faenor's host. Following after Faenor, Fingalor's vanguard, led by Fingon, came upon the battle after Faenor's host had been pushed back for the third time. Assuming that the Liinadi had been the aggressors, perhaps even on the orders of the The Pantheon themselves, the vanguard rushed to the aid of Faenor. The rest of Fingalor's host would follow shortly thereafter, and the Liinadi were overcome. Their ships were stolen, and many of the Liinadi mariners were wickedly slain. However, the Ñoldor did not escape unscathed by any means. In addition to taking significant losses during the battle, Ossë, who loved the Liinadi dearly, conjured terrible storms in vengeance for them. Many of the stolen ships were wrecked in these storms, and their Ñoldor crews drowned. Fingalor's host would not learn of Faenor's wickedness until after it was too late, and it caused much rancor amongst the already divided Ñoldor.

A short while after the battle, as the Ñoldor neared the Helcaraxë, they encountered a shrouded figure who may well have been Mandos himself. This figure uttered a terrible Doom, exiling the Ñoldor from The Blessed Realm and foretelling that their war against Tenebros would cause them only misery. Due to their wickedness in slaughtering their kin, they would be utterly forsaken in the eyes of the The Pantheon and would receive neither welcome nor aid from The Blessed Realm in their struggles. Additionally, Faenor and his house were cursed, and Mandos foretold great suffering, and hardship would be their lot, due in no small part to the oath they had taken to regain the Starstones at all costs. Above all, the figure made it explicitly clear that any war made by the Ñoldor against Tenebros would be entirely without hope; for Amtreadi, no matter how mighty, simply did not possess the power to overcome a Pantheon God. Upon hearing this Doom, Finarfin and his host turned back in grief, cursing Faenor.&#91;See Note&#93; They had not participated in the Kinslaying and as such were pardoned by the The Pantheon when they returned. They were gladly accepted back into Starhold by their remaining kin, whereafter Finarfin ruled as High-King of the Ñoldor in The Far West.  

Faenor however defied the Doom and proceeded onward, accompanied by Fingalor and the two remaining hosts. As such the journey northward continued, the land became ever darker, and as the Ñoldor drew ever closer to the Helcaraxë, the temperature began to precipitously drop. It was at this point that many of the Ñoldor began to openly express dissatisfaction with Faenor's leadership. Many of them had been reluctant to accept his kingship to begin with, and now the Kinslaying and the Doom had significantly decreased their tolerance for his belligerence. Additionally, the current situation presented a number of more practical issues. Not only were many of the Ñoldor suffering terribly from the arctic cold, but it had become clear that the storms of Ossë had wrecked too many of the ships to bear all of the Ñoldor at once to The Mortal Lands. However, the Doom of Mandos had kindled fear of treachery in the hearts of the Ñoldor, and none were willing to be left in The Far West while others crossed the sea first. Faenor was all too aware of both the dissatisfaction of his people and the problem that lay in ferrying all of them to The Mortal Lands, and he sought counsel with his sons. 

During this meeting, it came to light that Faenor's most loyal forces had incidentally maintained sole control of the Liinadi fleet after having seized it. As such, Faenor decided to simply abandon in The Far West all those whose loyalty to him was not absolute, and he and his followers slipped away one night in the ships. They arrived at Losgar, in the land of Lammoth, in the far west of Westlands, where Tenebros and The Webmother had passed not long before. Upon arriving, Faenor's eldest son Maedhros at once asked who would return upon the ships to ferry the rest of their people, but Faenor contemptuously decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingalor behind. This action was looked upon poorly by Maedhros, but he did not speak his mind to his father, and simply watched in stony silence as the ships burned. As the world was flat in those days, the remaining Ñoldor saw the far distant glow of the flames, and perceived that they were betrayed. Fingalor now had the choice of either returning to Starhold in disgrace or proceeding to The Mortal Lands across the treacherous and deadly Helcaraxë. Fingalor and his people chose to attempt the crossing, as many of Fingalor's host wished to continue and many, including Fingalor himself, were eager to confront Faenor and his people over their betrayal. In addition, and unlike the host of Finarfin, Fingalor's host had unwittingly participated in the Kinslaying, and they did not know how they might be judged if they were to return to the realm of the The Pantheon. The journey across the Grinding Ice was a long and terrible one, and Fingalor's host suffered great loss of life along the way, adding to the bitterness that the survivors felt for Faenor and his sons. Fingalor's descendants would reign over the Ñoldor until the death of Astorion many centuries later. 

Faenor's deeds, many of which were infamously despicable, cast a shadow over the interactions between the Liinadi and the returning Ñoldor. For Thingol, the King of Greyvale, eventually learned of the Kinslaying, the burning of the ships at Losgar, and the curse of Mandos. As the Liinadi were of Thingol's own kin, he was enraged to hear of the merciless and needless slaughter. The sons of Finarfin he came to forgive, as they were of his own kin and had not participated in the evil. Those of Fingalor's host, who had endured the horror of crossing the Helcaraxë after Faenor's betrayal, he held as having suffered enough hardship to redress their ills. But all those who had followed Faenor, were of his kin, or were friends of his kin, Thingol held in contempt and would have as little to do with as he could. Faenor's remaining sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Starstones, and this oath would eventually see two more Kinslayings come to pass, each more horrific than the last, and would work to undermine the Amtreadi war against Tenebros in many important ways. Aerendil's fate was to eternally traverse the Great Ocean with the Starstone that Beren and Luthiel had wrested from Tenebros and guard the Sun and Moon. After the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Starstones taken by the The Pantheon from Tenebros, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Starstone he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Starstone into the sea. Thereafter, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Starstone, until he faded from memory, though the circumstances and date of his death, if it ever happened at all, are unknown.

Faenor's grandson Celebranor, son of Curufin, repented of his family's actions and would remain in The Mortal Lands into the Second Era, where he founded the realm of Eregion. Like Faenor, Celebranor would be a great smith and helped create the Doors of Grundin in Shadowdeep, which would later bear the emblem of the House of Faenor: a single star with many rays. However, Celebranor, who also created the Bands of Binding, would later be killed by Malachar, ending Faenor's line.

## Prophecy
In most versions of the texts, following Tenebros's final return and defeat in the Dagor Dagorath, the world will be changed and the three Starstones will be recovered by the The Pantheon. Fёanor will break them open and with their light, Yavanna will revive the Two Trees, the Pelóri Mountains will be flattened, and the light of the Two Trees will fill The World again in a new age of eternal bliss.

## Etymology
- Originally named *Finwë* or *Finweminya* after his father, and later ***Curufinwë*** ("Skillful &#91;son of&#93; Finwë"), he was the greatest craftsmen of the Ñoldor, and very briefly their king.
- His name is a compromise between the Amtreadan *Faenor* and the High Amtreadan ***Fëanáro***, meaning "Spirit of fire". His current name, which appeared in the *Silmarillion*, is pronounced *FAY-ahnor.*
