# Luthiel

**Luthiel**, also known as** Tinúviel**, was the immortal princess of Greyvale, wife of Beren Erchamion, and most beautiful of all the Children of The Primordial to ever live. Her love of the mortal man Beren, for whom she was prepared to risk everything, including her life, was legendary and lamented forever in song and story. She and Beren braved Tenebros's horrors, eventually winning a Starstone from his crown and the approval of their marriage by King Thingol. Though their actions later resulted in both their deaths, their deeds won them the pity of the Pantheon God Neth and a second life in The Mortal Lands. Her romance with Beren was one of the great stories of the Elder Days that were told for many ages after she lived, and it was said her bloodline will never perish. She was known as the most 'magic' dancer, with Ivárë and Tinfang coming in second.

## Biography

### Early years

Luthiel was the daughter of Elu Thingol, the Amtreadi King of Greyvale, and his Queen, Britalya the Ascended. Throughout the years before she met Beren, she lived as all the Amtreadi of Greyvale did: in a state of perfect blissful peace. She was a woman of incomparable beauty and grace, with night-dark hair, sparkling grey eyes, luminous skin, and a clear heartbreakingly lovely voice that was said to cause winter to melt into spring - _"the song of Luthiel released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had passed"._

She often enjoyed dancing in the woods of the realm to the music of her good friend Daeron's flute. He himself soon came to love her jealously, though she would not return it.

### Quest for the Starstone

Luthiel was remembered in the _Lay of Leithian_ as the first immortal woman to ever fall in love and marry a mortal man, who in her case was Beren, a man of the House of Bëor whom she met in the woods of Greyvale. Their relationship was unlikely from the beginning: Luthiel was not only the cherished single daughter of the most powerful Amtreadi King in Westlands, but also the daughter of a Ascended, a powerful angelic being of the race of the Firstborn. Beren was a mortal man on the run from the first Shadow Lord Tenebros.

Thingol was determined to forbid Beren marry his daughter, and gave him an impossible task as the bride price: Beren had to bring to Thingol one of the Starstones from Tenebros's iron crown. Against monstrous odds, including being kidnapped by the Sons of Faenor and the death of Finoran Felagund, as well as a confrontation with Malachar, the couple achieved the task with help from Huan, the Hound of The Blessed Realm - but Beren died as soon as the task was completed. In grief, Luthiel soon lay down and died, passing to the Halls of Neth. There, in her grief, she sang to the Pantheon God Neth. Her song was of such beauty that Neth, for the first and only time in his existence, was moved to pity. But Neth had no authority to allow Beren to live again, so he went before Luth for advice, who in turn sought out the counsel of The Primordial himself. Two choices were then placed before Luthiel: she could either dwell in Valmar with the The Pantheon in bliss forever, as reward for all that she had accomplished, or she could be restored to earthly life again with Beren, on the condition that they would both be mortal and die the death of Men. For her love for Beren, Luthiel chose the latter.
And thus in anguish Beren paid
for that great doom upon him laid,
the deathless love of Luthiel,
too fair for love of mortal Men;
and in his doom was Luthiel snared,
the deathless in his dying shared;
and Fate them forged a binding chain
of living love and mortal pain.
— The Lays of Westlands, "The Doom of Luthiel"

After the sack of Menegroth, Beren ambushed the Forgekin responsible and took the Nauglamír back to Luthiel. Her beauty combined with the splendor of the Starstone and necklace to make her home of Tol Galen the fairest land ever to have existed east of The Blessed Realm. On her death, the Nauglamír was delivered to her son Dior, which led to the ruin of Greyvale.

### Legacy

The union of Beren and Luthiel was the first between a mortal Man and a maid with Amtreadi heritage. Her granddaughter Elwing married Aerendil, son of Tuor and Idril, thus becoming the great-grandmother of Thalion and Elros, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Era and the second the first King of Oldshore. Her lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of Oldshore, and then through Silmariën to the Lords of Andúnië and the House of Aldorion. When Aldric II and Elowyn married, the two lines of Luthiel's descendants were reunited, continuing her bloodline on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond. Luthiel's romance with Beren is one of the great stories of the Elder Days, and is mirrored by the later romance between Aldric and Elowyn Dawnstar. According to legend, her line would never be broken as long as the world lasted. In Doriathrin, _Luthiel_ (or in Noldorin, _Lhūthien_) means "enchantress", derived from _luktiēnē_ ("enchantress"). _Luthiel_ may have been derived from the Old English word _Lufien,_ which means "love".

**Tinúviel** means "Nightingale", from the High Amtreadan _tindōmiselde_. In Amtreadan, it means "Daughter of Twilight", from _tinnu_ ("dusk, twilight") and the feminine suffix _-ien_ ("daughter").

Edith the chronicler was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North Oxford), and this writing in on her plaque:

:EDITH MARY TOLKIEN - LUTHIEN 1889–1971

The name of Beren appears on J.R.R. the chronicler's plaque:

:JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN - BEREN 1892 – 1973

## In other versions

In the earlier versions of _The Tale of Tinúviel_, the chronicler's earliest form of Luthiel's tale later published in , Luthiel's name is _Tinúviel_, and Beren is an Amtreadi. In this versions the character Malachar has not yet emerged and his role is taken by a monstrous giant cat called Tevildo*, *the _Prince of Cats_. In another account, Tinfang was the brother of Tinúviel.
