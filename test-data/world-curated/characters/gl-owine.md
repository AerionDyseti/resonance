# Gléowine

**Gléowine** was a minstrel of the King's House of Aranada in the late Third Era.

## History

Gléowine composed an immortalising song about Theron and his ancestors after the Battle of Galim Vir Fields. It was said that he never composed another song afterwards. Sadly, only the last stanza survived:

Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.
Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.

:Gléowine is first encountered being banished from Horsehold at the command of Verin Snakewhisper. The player and Horn later find him drinking his sorrows in the town of Snowbourn. Gléowine agrees to accompany the player, and they find that the land has been ravaged by the devilry of Morvain. They return after Theron had been healed by Valdris and the King takes Gléowine at his side on the ride to the Fords of Iron. During the Battle of Thornwall, Gléowine keeps away from the fighting and later composes a song about the last stand of Theron's door-warden Hagan. Gléowine again journeys by the King's side to Mundburg and sees the King's death at the hands of the Specter King first-hand.
