AI summary: Vel'exzhir Shæbridin, a Dro'adi Monk from House Shæbridin, experiences significant visions during the Heroes for Hire campaign, realizing that a catastrophic event must occur to return home. Trained under Master Vhaeris, Vel'exzhir navigates complex political landscapes and successfully leads the party while grappling with the implications of their journey and the cost of returning to Vrasillex.

## Overview

Dro'adi Monk (Way of Mercy), one of the player characters in the Heroes for Hire campaign. Native to Vrasillex and member of House Shæbridin, one of the thirteen ruling matriarchal houses.

## Naming Convention

- **Given Name**: Vel'exzhir
- **House Name**: Shæbridin
- House Shæbridin is one of the thirteen ruling matriarchal houses of Vrasillex

## Time Pool Visions (Session 9)

### Present (Medium Pool)

Saw Master Vhaeris training in the present.

### Future (Fast Pool)

Saw a war-weary, scarred, hardened version of themselves wearing armor and wielding weapons of human make (which they did not recognize—also from the future).

## The Crucial Realization

Vel'exzhir made the crucial Arcana check in Session 9, putting together the pieces:

- The explosion at the Spiral Stone Grove echoes backward and forward through time
- The party rode that shockwave to arrive in the Age of Mythology
- **The only way back is to be at the epicenter when the impact happens**
- Therefore, the catastrophe cannot be stopped if they want to return home

## Background

Trained at the Monastery of the Spiral Dance under Master Vhaeris. The return to Vrasillex is particularly significant given their status as a member of one of the ruling houses.

## Campaign Highlights

### Heroes for Hire

- Escaped Ataniisti capture with Sonder and Vel'Sha
- Led the party to Vrasillex, invoking house connections for protection
- Successfully navigated Dro'adi law and politics to secure Sonder's protection
- Made the grim realization about the price of returning home
