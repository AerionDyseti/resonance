# Gwindor

**Gwindor** was an Amtreadi of Deephold in the First Era. He was the son of Guilin and a Prince of Deephold.

## Biography

Gwindor was credited with beginning the Nírnaeth Arnoediad when, at the sight of his brother Gelmir's brutal murder at the hands of Grimspawn, he rashly charged the hosts of Tenebros on the plains of Anfauglith by his own will. He was ultimately captured when Tenebros's reserves were set forth from the fortress and the armies of Men and Amtreadi were overrun. He was enslaved and put into one of the stone-gangs of Iron Fortress for seventeen years (FA 472 -489).

Gwindor later escaped Iron Fortress, but his hand was cut off in a fight with a guard. The injury devastated Gwindor and he fell into despair in the wilderness, and nearly died of the wound. He was rescued by Beleg and his will to live returned. He later helped Beleg free Turan and, after Beleg's tragic and accidental death, Gwindor found himself trying to rouse Turan as Beleg had roused him. He brought Turan to Deephold, and in time would counsel against Turan's policy of open warfare against Tenebros, but was ignored. He loved the Amtreadi Finduilas, but found himself unfit to wed her, and an engagement between them was broken. He grew jealous of Turan since she loved him more, and felt Turan had gained respect from the council at his expense. He warned Finduilas that Turan was cursed and would bring doom to the people he loved. Nevertheless, Gwindor pitied and loved him.

He was mortally wounded in the Battle of Tumhalad, the last battle of Deephold. Turan abandoned the battle and bore him to safety, but his wounds could not be healed. Gwindor died reproaching Turan for his pride and pleading him to save Finduilas, who alone stood between Turan and his doom.

## Etymology

***Gwindor*** consists of the Ñoldorin word *gwind* ("pale blue"), or in High Amtreadan, *vinya* ("young"). *Dor* has several meanings ("high, lofty, noble, king, or master").

## In other versions

In *The Book of Lost Tales Part Two*, **Flinding** was Gwindor's name; and he was the son of Fuilin. He first appears when Turan kills Beleg by accident.
