# Great grey chief wolf

The "**chief wolf**" was the great grey leader of the Shadowwolves from beyond the Edge of the Wild that were often allies of the Northern Grimspawn. The number of Shadowwolves in the chief wolf's pack was untold, but was known to consist of many hundreds of wolves.

## Biography
The early life of the chief wolf is untold. Either prior or during his leadership, the chief wolf often met with the Northern Grimspawn of Goblin-town at their meeting-place to discuss plans for raids on the Woodmen of Western Gloomwood. During these raids, the chief wolf's Shadowwolves were often prevented from devouring any Woodman that the Grimspawn wished to take away as a slave.. Occasionally, the chief wolf's words would be answered in unison by the other wolves. They discussed how the Grimspawn were late for their planned raid on the Woodmen that night. Like the rest of his pack, the chief wolf assumed that the Company were spying on them and were friends of the Woodmen. To prevent their planned raid from being leaked to the Woodmen, the chief wolf planned to keep the Company pinned in the trees until morning or until the Grimspawn arrived.
