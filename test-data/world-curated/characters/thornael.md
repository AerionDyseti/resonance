# Thornael

**Thornael**, son of Oropher, was an Amtreadi king who ruled over the Woodland Realm in the Third Era. Though inherently cautious, his army was key to victory in the Battle of Five Armies and he defended his realm against the forces of Malachar in the War of the Binding. He was the father of the Amtreadi prince of Gloomwood, Sylvorn, who was a member of the Company of the Band.

In , Thornael is referred to only as the **Amtreadi King**.

## Biography
### First and Second Ages
Thornael was the only son of Oropher, King of the Woodland Realm. He was born during the First Era, and lived in Greyvale at some point prior to the Second Kinslaying. At the beginning of the Second Era, some Liinadi traveled east and Oropher eventually founded the Amtreadi realm in Greenwood.

In SA 3434, Thornael and his father fought in the Battle of Battle Plain. Oropher was slain and Thornael returned to Greenwood with roughly a third of the army that had marched to war.

In his realm, both Amtreadan and Liinadi Amtreadan were spoken,

After the death of the wyrm Scorath, Thornael supported Braden the Archer's claim of a share of the treasure the Forgekin recovered from the Ironpeak, since Braden was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and the treasure of that town had been taken by Scorath to the Ironpeak.

Thornael led the Amtreadi forces in the Battle of Five Armies. His army was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge. 

After the battle and Durgan's death, Thornael took Grimcleaver, which was previously confiscated in Gloomwood, and laid it upon Durgan's tomb. The treasure was divided among Amtreadi and Men, and Thornael received the emeralds in the necklace of Girion, which he most desired. Jasper, Valdris and Bjorn traveled with the Amtread-host back to Gloomwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thornael asked them to.

When Jasper and Valdris bade farewell, Jasper gave Thornael a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Jasper the title of "amtreadi-friend" and returned with his host to their halls. He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Forest or left The Mortal Lands and departed to the Eternal Shore.

## Etymology
- Thornael* is a Amtreadan word for "Vigorous spring", from *tharan* ("vigorous") and *ethuil* ("spring"). It was said that the name "Thornael" was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Amtreadan names such as Sylvorn, Nimrodel, and Amroth among others.

### Titles
Thornael first appears as a character in *The Shirefolk,* where he is not named. J.R.R. the chronicler refers to him as *the amtreadi-king* or *the king*, The name *Thornael* first appears in , in which his title was given as the **King of the Amtreadi of Northern Gloomwood**. Though he was not seen afterwards, it was safe to assume that after the funerals and burials, Thornael departed for Gloomwood.

### Voice dubbing actors

### Rankin/Bass's *The Shirefolk*
In the Rankin/Bass 1977 animated version of ,, Thornael was voiced by Otto Preminger. In this version he is a golden-haired, balding, green-skinned being whose people bear little resemblance to the more human-looking Amtreadi led by Thalion. He captures Durgan's company after mistaking their approach for an attack, and despite their attempts to convince him otherwise he has them imprisoned. He and Braden later join forces to take the Ironpeak, only to quickly join forces with Durgan's army of Forgekin upon seeing the approach of the Goblin army.

### Radio
In the , he is voiced by Leonard Fenton.

### Video games
- Thornael is also one of the playable Amtreadi heroes in the real-time strategy game .

-  In , Thornael's earliest appearances are during the War of the Final Alliance. He can be found during the Battle of Battle Plain and later is seen during the Siege of The Obsidian Spire.
-  In the present time, Thornael is first encountered fighting in Gloomwood during the last days of the War of the Binding. He joins the forces of Lord Caelorn and Lady Aelindra and after a brief discussion their combined host moves on Dol Guldur where Aelindra brings down the fortress. Afterwards he and Caelorn renamed the forest Eryn Lasgalen and divide it into three parts, giving the middle section to the Woodmen of Western Gloomwood. Thornael then returns to his halls in Felegoth where his son Sylvorn and the player join him after the Binding Band is destroyed. Thornael's people have to deal with an unexpected situation when most of spiders in Gloomwood, except for the very young or very old ones, suddenly depart the forest en masse, traveling south to answer the call of the source of the new threat and preventing it from reaching his borders.
