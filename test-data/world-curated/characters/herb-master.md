# Herb-master

The **herb-master** was a title given to an unnamed character who served in the Houses of Healing in Silverspire. He was well-versed in herb-lore, particularly the many names given to different plants, as well as their uses. He disapproved of the old rhymes still repeated by the older women such as Ioreth, referring to such verses as garbled and doggerel. When Aldric sent Ioreth to acquire *athelas* for use in healing those suffering from the Black Shadow, she apparently notified the herb-master, who arrived and proceeded to irritate both Aldric and Valdris by listing off various names of the plant they sought, before eventually declaring that there was none kept in the Houses of Healing, on account of its not having any virtues known to the Solaarans, save for its mention in the black breath verse, which he thought likely to be meaningless. Valdris, in his irritation, sent him to find "some old man of less lore and more wisdom" who still kept *athelas*. Aldric, also annoyed, later made a joking remark about the herb-master's unhelpful tendencies to Marric, who had misplaced the pack containing his leafweed.

The character of the herb-master appears much the same in the earlier drafts of The Houses of Healing, aside from the fact that some of the herb-names which he mentions were later altered by the chronicler (e.g., *asea aranaite* to *asëa aranion*).
