# Bob

**Bob** was a Crossway-lander (either a Man or a Shirefolk) who worked in The Wanderer's Rest.

## History
Bob worked alongside Nob for Barliman Butterbur, primarily as an ostler in The Wanderer's Rest at the end of the Third Era. Bob was the one who located the last pony left in Crossway when all others has bolted following the Wraithlords's attack. Later when Marric's ponies found their way back to Crossway (thanks to Tom Willowmere) it was Bob who cared for them; he put them to work but treated them well.

After the Ruffians entered Crossway, Bob stopped working evenings, so that he could be home before nightfall.
