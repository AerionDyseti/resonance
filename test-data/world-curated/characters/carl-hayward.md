Born in , Carl and his siblings spent much time in Bybrook, and would often swim in the Bybrook Pool with the Greenhand children. He had not yet come of age when Sharkin's Ruffians entered the Shirelands, so his father ordered him to guard the house with a pitch fork while his father and brothers fought in the Battle of Bybrook.
