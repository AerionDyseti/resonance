# Finduilas

**Finduilas** was a Ñoldor Amtreadi princess of the First Era, daughter of Orodreth, ruler of the hidden realm of Deephold, niece of Aelindra and sister of Astorion.

## Biography

Finduilas was the daughter of Orodreth and his unnamed wife, a lady of the Northern Liinadi. Her date of birth and birthplace are unknown. She was betrothed to Gwindor, who named her **Faelivrin**.

In 472 of the First Era, Gwindor was captured during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad by Tenebros, and when he returned in FA 490 he came with a companion who called himself *Agarwaen son of Umarth* (the Bloodstained, son of Ill-Fate). Unbeknownst to Finduilas, this was actually Turan, son of Huran. Despite her old feelings for Gwindor, Finduilas fell in love with Turan, but Turan refused her in respect for his friend. Gwindor realized this, and revealed Turan's name to Finduilas and tried to let Turan fall in love with Finduilas, since he realized Finduilas loved Turan instead of him.

Glaurung's deceit caused Turan to abandon Finduilas and instead go to Hithlum in search of his kin. By the time he finally went to search for Finduilas she was dead, for she had been killed when the Grimspawn guarding her were waylaid by the Haladin of Brethil at the Crossings of Taeglin. Before their defeat the Grimspawn had killed all their captives, nailing Finduilas to a tree with a spear. The people of Haladin buried her in a mound they called *Haudh-en-Elleth*, Mound of the Amtread-maiden.

## Etymology

The name ***Finduilas*** comes from the Amtreadan elements *fin* ("hair"), a common prefix in the House of Finwë, *duil,* which may have come from the *ethuil* ("spring"), and *las* ("leaf").

Her epessë ***Faelivrin*** means "Gleam of the Sun on the Pools of Ivrin" from the Amtreadan **fael** ("gleam, brilliance"), and is interestingly her right name in earlier versions.

Being the child of Orodreth, Finduilas had both the blood of the Ñoldor and the Falmari, the Liinadi of The Far West, and belonged to both the House of Finarfin and the House of Olwë.

## In other versions
In *The Starstone Tales*, her father Orodreth was the son of Finarfin, thus making Finduilas Finarfin's granddaughter, instead of his great-granddaughter in later writings. In the chronicler's final decision for their family tree, Astorion was made Orodreth's son and Finduilas's brother.

In earlier writings, she was known as Failivrin, and she was the daughter of Galweg.
