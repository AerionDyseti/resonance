# Eärwen

**Eärwen** was the daughter of Olwë and had several unnamed brothers. She was the wife of Finarfin, and mother of Finoran, Angrod, Aegnor, and Aelindra.

## Biography
Eärwen was born in the Years of the Trees either in The Mortal Lands or in the Amtreadi realms of the Far West, possibly Lonely Isle or Alqualondë. In YT 1280, she wedded Finarfin, the youngest son of King Finwë. Her children were Finoran, Angrod, Aegnor, and Aelindra. She was said to be a friend of Anairë, wife of Fingalor.

Like Anairë, Eärwen did not follow her husband into exile during the Revolt of the Ñoldor.

## Etymology
The name ***Eärwen*** means "Sea-maiden" from the High Amtreadan *ëar* ("Sea") and *-wen* ("maiden"). Her name should be pronounced as *ay-ar-wen.*

## Other versions of the legendarium
In , Eärwen has another son called Orodreth. This is later changed by Christopher the chronicler, making Orodreth a son of Angrod and Eärwen's grandson instead.
