# Grishnákh

**Grishnákh** was a captain of Grimspawn from Ashvale. He was described as being a short, crook-legged creature, broad, with long arms hanging almost to the ground.

## History
On 26 February  Grishnákh was part of a raiding party that captured Marric and Perrin at Parth Galen. He was the captain of a group of Ashvale-grimspawn which had joined Uglúk's forces on the plains of Aranada during the War of the Binding. When Perrin awoke and heard the Grimspawn arguing he noted that Grishnákh's voice sounded softer but more evil than the others. Grishnákh threatened to report the doings of the mountain-grimspawn and of Uglúk to Lugbúrz (The Obsidian Spire).

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:No individual grimspawn are identified - or identifiable, but one grimspawn yells "Grishnákh" to another when they are surrounded by the Aranadan. Marric also tells one grimspawn (as with the book) that if the Band goes to Ironspire there will be nothing "for poor Grishnákh".

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:**
:Grishnákh is played by Stephen Ure. He is a common grimspawn who is crushed by Rootbeard after he attempts to kill Marric and Perrin. 

**2002: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):**
:The voice of Grishnákh is provided by Eduard Vitek.

**2004: *The Master of the Bands: War of the Binding*:*'
