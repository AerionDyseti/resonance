# Daeron

**Daeron** was a Amtreadan Amtreadi who dwelt in Greyvale as the chief loremaster and minstrel of King Thingol during the First Era.

He is known primarily for his role in the tale of Beren and Luthiel where, out of his own unrequited love for Thingol's daughter Luthiel, he twice betrayed her to Thingol. After Luthiel escaped and fled Greyvale, Daeron became lost in the search for her, and eventually wandered east over the Blue Mountains.

His role is primarily told within *The Lay of Leithian*, which itself is referred to within *The Starstone Tales* where Daeron's history is much more briefly given.

## History
### Early history

Though Daeron's origins were not recorded, he was known to be in Thingol's service prior to , by which time he had devised his Runes, which he would go on to greatly better with time.

At some point, after the arrival of the Green-amtreadi in  Daeron became friends with Saeros, who also was skilled in song. 

In , when Fingalor, King of the Amtreadi, held the great Feast of Reuniting, Daeron came as one of the two messengers of Thingol bringing his greetings.

Daeron was enamoured of Luthiel, daughter of Thingol and Melian, and all his thought of her was set in the music he made for her song and dance.

### The arrival of Beren
One night, in the mid-summer of , Daeron was piping his music and Luthiel came out to dance. Soon though, her feet stilled and she sang a song of such bewildering delight that Daeron ceased piping and cast his flute away, heart-broken and wonder bound as stone. As she was singing however, Beren emerged from the darkness, stumbling as if in doubt or blind. As Luthiel's song ended Daeron, released from its spell, became aware of Beren's presence. Assuming Beren to be an enemy, Daeron fled in dismay, calling for Luthiel to flee and follow him. Luthiel, who had never known fear, initially stood unmoved, but was soon seized by it and vanished.

In the following spring, of , Daeron discovered Luthiel's love for Beren when he espied them dancing together. In an act of jealousy, he then cursed a spell of silence on Greyvale, causing a hush to come over birds, trees, and even the river Esgalduin. This was brought to the attention of Thingol, and he sent for Daeron to ask what omen this silence meant; initially, he was even hopeful that it may be a sign of the return of Oromë. Daeron however disabused him of that hope, stating that another had entered Greyvale and chilled the woods by their strange deeds, and that if the king did not see not the cause, the queen might guess, and the maiden doubtless knew. Thingol, angered by this riddle, ordered Daeron to speak plainly on who was in his woods. Daeron, however, looked on Luthiel and faltered, seeing his disgrace and said no more.

### Escape of Luthiel
Later, Luthiel learned from Melian that Beren had been captured by Malachar and in her despair came upon Daeron. She asked him to play music for her heartache and dread, and Daeron reluctantly did so, playing a song of sadness which stayed all things in the woods and caused all mirth to be forgotten. Once he had finished, Luthiel then begged him to accompany her to aid Beren; at this Daeron stated he had no love for Beren nor wept for his captivity, but that he would defend Luthiel from peril and wondering into hell. Luthiel, assuming this meant he would help, thanked him and left, but Daeron instead went directly to Thingol and informed him of Luthiel's intentions. Thingol thanked Daeron, and proclaimed that love would ever be between them, and named him a prince.

Out of fear for her safety Thingol put Luthiel into captivity, placing her in a house built high within the great tree Hírilorn, intending to keep her there until she grew wiser and the spell of madness left her. Daeron, grieving for Luthiel's captivity, frequently came to the base of the tree and played melodies on his flute. Luthiel eventually forgave Daeron for his betrayal, and he alone was allowed to cross her threshold. Eventually, she asked Daeron to use his woodcraft and fashion for her a small loom in order to pass the time. Daeron did this, and after giving it to inquired what she planed on making: when she then told him it would be an enchanted thread, Daeron feared the dark purpose of her art, but spoke no word to Thingol of it.

After Luthiel departed in secret from Greyvale, Daeron sought for her in despair, and wandered upon strange paths until he eventually passed over the Blue Mountains. For many ages he made lament beside dark waters for Luthiel, daughter of Thingol, most beautiful of all living things.

Daeron was also a skilled in woodcraft, as was noted by Luthiel when she requested he make her a small loom.

In the earlier Etymologies the Doriathrin name is given as **Dairon** shown as related to the Doriathrin word for shadow, *dai*.

Consequently, Christopher the chronicler speculated in *The Starstone Tales*, that the name perhaps included the Amtreadan word *dae* "shadow".

## Other versions of the legendarium
### The Book of Lost Tales
**Dairon** is first introduced in *The Tale of Tinúviel* from *The Book of Lost Tales*. While he plays a near identical role, he is the brother of Tinúviel (Luthiel) rather than an unrequited lover. He is described as "a boy, strong and merry" and along with Tinfang Warble and Ivárë, one of the three most magical music players among the Amtreadi.

Changes made within the Lost Tales are the children of "Linwë Tinto" and "Wendelin" being originally **Timpinen** (Tinfang) and Tinúviel; and the name "Dairon" being preceded by **Tifanto**, which itself was preceded by **Kapalen**.

Tifanto had originally joined the hunting of Karkaras, for which he "cast aside his pipe and grasped a spear". As this passage was written after Dairon was already stated as becoming lost Christopher the chronicler speculated that his father, noticing the contradiction, then replaced Dairon at this instance with the new character Mablung.

In drafts of *The Master of the Bands*, other names were considered for the minstrel of Greyvale: *"Ilverin"*, *"Iverin"*, *"Neldorín"*, *"Elberin"*, and *"Diarin"*.

In earlier versions of *Narn i Hîn Huran* Saeros was said to be a kinsman, and then brother, of Daeron.

In a commentary and history on language interrelation, Celebranor was stated as a Sinda who claimed descent from Daeron.
