# Ecthelion

**Ecthelion** was an Amtread-lord of Hidden City, leader of the People of the Fountain and slayer of Gorthak, Lord of Flamefiends. He was also at one point the Warden of the Great Gate of Hidden City. Ecthelion had the most beautiful voice and greatest musical talent with the flute of all the people of Hidden City.

## History

In the year , Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon in the battle Battle of Unnumbered Tears, leading a wing of Hidden City's forces. Upon the defeat of the Amtreadi, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated. Surviving the disastrous battle, Ecthelion returned towards the Hidden City where he next appeared as Warden of the Great Gate.

Twenty-three years after Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Tuor and Voronwë traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil through the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them. He is portrayed as great and lordly, all clad in silver and having a bright glance. Upon his helm there was a spike with a diamond point, and he bore a shield which shimmered as "a thousand studs of crystal". At first denying passage for Tuor, he allows it after the latter shows the arms of Vinyamar and mentions Ulmo, saying that the Lord of the Fountains should not oppose the Lord of the Waters.

In the year , Tenebros attacked the city. Ecthelion battled there against Gorthak, Lord of Flamefiends in the Place of the Fountain, where they slew each other. The battle was well detailed in _The Fall of Hidden City_, and long remembered by the amtreadi.

## Etymology

With the development of the Amtreadan languages, the name _Ecthelion_ had its own evolution.

The early Gnomish conception meant "Lord of the Fountains", from _ecthel_ ("issue of water, spring"). Its Qenya cognate was **_Ektelion_**.

In the Noldorin stage of the name, it is composed from _ehtë_ ("spear") and _thela_ ("point" of spear). Put together they could be translated as "Spear-point" or "Spear-head".

The Amtreadan version should have been **_Ægthelion_**, derived from _aeg_ ("sharp") + _thel_ ("intent, resolve") + _-on_ (masculine suffix). However, the chronicler wrote that the early _Ecthelion_ sounded good and it had already been used in publication (with the name of two ruling stewards in _The Master of the Bands_), so he let it as a late colloquial form of the archaic Amtreadan name _Ægthelion_

## Other versions of the legendarium

### The Book of Lost Tales

The most detailed text about Ecthelion and his deeds during the Fall of Hidden City is the chapter "The Fall of Hidden City", in _The Book of Lost Tales_. There it is told that he is the lord of the house of the Fountain, one of the twelve houses of the Gondothlim. Its people found delight in diamonds and the silver of their arrays was most beautiful to the sight.

During the siege of the city, Ecthelion led his folk into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes, and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.

### A note from _The Nature of The Mortal Lands_

In a very late note dated c. 1972-3, the chronicler seemed to imply that Ecthelion and Egalmoth were of royal lineage, since some Ruling Stewards of Argenthal were named after "\*renowned heroes in the **royal lines of old\***".
