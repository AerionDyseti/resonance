# Vorniel

**Vorniel** was an Amtreadi of Goldwood, probably a Liinadi Amtreadi, and a marchwarden who guarded the forest's northern borders. 

## History
Vorniel was one of the Galadhrim; unlike his brothers, Rúmil and Orophin, Vorniel had traveled outside Goldwood and knew Common Tongue. He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded cloaks and living on *flets* in the trees. 

Vorniel was accompanied by his brothers between 15 and 16 January,  when they encountered the Company of the Band who arrived in Goldwood. His brothers interacted little with the Company because they spoke little of the Common Speech. He treated Thorngar rather poorly due to bad relations between Amtreadi and Forgekin. He made him go blindfolded through the wood until Aelindra said he did not have to. 

He had heard of Aldric, but there is no indication that they had met before. Vorniel became their guide to the city of Silvertree. 

After Caelorn and Aelindra had nourished their guests, and they were set to depart, Vorniel led them to their Amtreadi boats.

## Etymology

- Vorniel* is clearly Amtreadan, but it is never glossed. In the earlier legendarium, the chronicler glossed Noldorin *Vorniel* as "Hidden Hero", though this Vorniel refers to the (later omitted) son of Orodreth.
