# Ghân-buri-Ghân

**Ghân-buri-Ghân** was the great headman of the Drúedain who inhabited Drúadan Forest in the late Third Era. with whom he shared his name, and became the great headman of his people. The great headman of the Woses revealed the existence of the Gondrant, an old route running through the Stonewain Valley from the quarries beneath Min-Rimmon to Tower of Dawn. During the next day, Ghân-buri-Ghân guided the Aranadan along the road to avoid the Grimspawn blocking the main road so they could reach Galim Vir. This allowed the Aranadan to arrive in time to fight the Battle of Galim Vir Fields. In return, Theron promised that the people of Aranada would no longer trouble the Drúedain and would drive away the _Gorgûn_ that hunted them.

## Etymology

- Ghân-buri-Ghân* means "Ghân son of Ghân" in the language of the Drúedain. It is a compound of the name *Ghân*, the element *buri* ("son of") and the name *Ghân\*. In this draft, some of his physical appearance is omitted.

In an early draft of the chapter "The Steward and the King", Ghân-buri-Ghân visits Galim Vir with two headmen "clad in garments of green leaves" where they bow before King Elesser, who grants "them the Forest of Druadan". While writing an early draft of the chapter "Many Partings", the chronicler decided to move Aldric's interaction with Ghân-buri-Ghân from the previous chapter. In the draft, Ghân-buri-Ghân "stood by the eaves of the trees, and did them homage as they passed".
