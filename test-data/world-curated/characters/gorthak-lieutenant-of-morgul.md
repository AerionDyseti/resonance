# Gorthak (Lieutenant of Morgul)

**Gorthak** was the lieutenant of Galim Errav. It is possible that Gorthak was second-in-command to the Lord of the Wraithlords or less likely second-in-command of the troops of Galim Errav. Gorthak was also the name of the Lord of Flamefiends from the First Era.

## History

On March 15 after the Lord of the Wraithlords was slain by Shieldwyn during the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, Gorthak ordered reserves consisting of Easterlings with axes, Variags of Khand, Southrons in scarlet and black men like half-stonelurks with white eyes and red tongues, which had been accumulated at the ruined city of Starbridge to move into the Galim Vir Fields to attack the cavalry of the Aranadan and of Argenthal.

## Origin

Almost nothing is known about Gorthak. the chronicler scholars speculate that Gorthak might have been one of the following:

- A Man, in which case Gorthak was probably a Black Oldbloods like the Voice of Malachar
- One of the Wraithlords, although the chronicler never specifically mentions Gorthak among the Wraithlords.
- Gorthak could be anything from an Grimspawn or Ironspawn, (despite possessing a Amtreadan name) or a Boldog, a fallen Ascended in Grimspawn form.

'*1977: *War of the Binding\* (board game):\*\*
:Gorthak is the second most powerful Wraithlords. He begins the game at Dol Guldur.

**1982-97: _The Mortal Lands Role Playing_:**
:Gorthak is a half-stonelurk, a crossbreed of stonelurks and Variags.

\**2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:*'
:Gorthak is portrayed as an Grim-general with a misshapen face. He is played by Lawrence Makoare and voiced by Craig Parker. Peter Jackson wanted to show a hideously deformed grimspawn, one that would aptly convey the "ugliness" of Ashvale. The upper left side of Gorthak's body is swollen and pock-marked from a disease of some sort, as described by the design department. His pale, yellow skin may also be a consequence of this illness. Gorthak's intelligence is far above that of the common grimspawn and he, understandably, would be the perfect link between the Witch-King and the other planners of the siege of Galim Vir (most likely men in Malachar's service) and the mindless mass of grimspawn infantry on the front lines. While Gorthak likely did not have the intelligence to design the attack on the Silver City he certainly would have been able to ensure orders were carried out. Gorthak is clearly a brutal commander, but also an over-confident one. Peter Jackson comments that Gorthak feels powerful with Ashvale's massive army behind him, but in reality is a crippled grimspawn, as seen in his failed dismount from a Shadowwolf in the Extended edition. Gorthak does, however, seem to be a capable warrior, though somewhat inhibited by his crippled left side.

:In the midst of the chaos, Gorthak is forced into hand-to-hand combat. He sees a pocket of particularly stiff resistance, primarily from Theron and Shieldwyn, and decides to fight Shieldwyn. She is a more skilled fighter than he, however, and soon injures him on his crippled left leg, rendering him essentially unable to walk and useless to Ashvale's army as a whole. After Shieldwyn has killed the Witch-King, in an act of revenge, Gorthak attempts to kill her with a mace he finds nearby. He is, however, killed just in time by Aldric and Thorngar. As he is about to strike, Aldric cuts off his armored right arm, but Gorthak persists and Thorngar hits him in the abdomen with his axe. Aldric then cuts through Gorthak's armor on the right side with his sword to finally bring the Grimspawn down.

:In October 2021, news spread that Elijah Wood claimed on a podcast that one of the grimspawn masks in the films "was designed to look like Harvey Weinstein". While Wood did not explicitly refer to Gorthak as portrayed in the movie, Gorthak's grimspawn mask was widely identified as the grimspawn character in question.

'*2015: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Gorthak plays a major role in the game as the chief antagonist of several Epic story-lines and is also combined with the character of Eärnur. In the game's version of events, in Galim Errav Eärnur was transformed into a wraith named **Mordirith** in service of the Specter King, who in mockery of the Stewards of Argenthal made Mordirith his own Steward at Carn Dûm in Angmar. Long absent from that evil bastion, Mordirith returns to Carn Dûm shortly before War of the Binding, launching attacks against the Free Peoples of Eriador. Mordirith is defeated at the end of the game's original storyline, plunging the other servants of Malachar into a civil war over his position before he returns and his identity is revealed at the end of _Volume I_. He is defeated again, but instead of being sent back to the North he is bestowed upon the name of **Gorthak** and is ordered to lead the Witch-King's armies against Argenthal.

:The player doesn't meet him again until Starbridge, shortly before the Siege of Galim Vir. During the Battle of Galim Vir Fields Gorthak personally kills the Warden Halbarad, but when his master is undone and can no longer bring him back from the Void, he suddenly feels fear again and flees the battlefield before Aldric. Gorthak barricades himself inside Galim Errav, refusing even Malachar's muster to the Obsidian Gate. Though he outlives the Shadow Lord's demise, his other surviving servants blame Gorthak for it and combine their forces to assault of the City of the Ghosts. This gives the players and a group of Wardens of Moonvale the opportunity to sneak inside and challenge Gorthak, delivering a final defeat to him.

'*2023: *The Master of the Bands: Tales of The Mortal Lands*:*'
:Gorthak is portayed in the _Gorthak, Morgul Lieutenant_ card as a human.
