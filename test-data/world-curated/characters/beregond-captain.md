# Beregond (Captain)

**Beregond**, son of Baranor, was the first Captain of the White Company, the guard of Aldwin, Prince of Moonvale, and previously, a Guard of the Citadel in Silverspire. He is best known for rescuing Aldwin from the madness of Thornhelm during the Siege of Argenthal.

He had two sons, Bergil and Borlas, with an unnamed wife.

## Biography
At some point in his life, Beregond became a Guard of the Citadel, serving in the Third Company. He never left Silverspire during his service in the guard before the War of the Binding. He was also a great admirer of Aldwin, son of Thornhelm II, and perhaps one of his friends as well.

When Perrin Ashford came to the city in March 3019, Beregond and his son Bergil served as his guides in Silverspire.

During the Siege of Argenthal, Beregond received news from Perrin that Thornhelm intended to kill both himself and the seemingly-dead Aldwin. Leaving his post, he fought the door guards of the place where Thornhelm had taken Aldwin in order to reach him, until the arrival of Valdris and Perrin, whereupon Aldwin was saved. After protecting Aldwin, he carried him to the Houses of Healing and stood guard over him until he awoke.

Beregond traveled with Aldric's army to the Obsidian Gate of Ashvale to challenge the forces of Malachar. They served under Prince Imrahil, and during the Battle of the Obsidian Gate Beregond was nearly killed by a Stonelurk.

After the War of the Binding, Beregond was brought before the newly crowned King Stonehelm to answer for the abandonment of his post, as well as the murders of those who stood in his way as he raced to rescue Aldwin. Recognizing that what he did was out of love for his lord, he did not impose the death penalty upon him; the newly-crowned king's largesse allowed for Beregond to simply be banished from Silverspire but this was under old Argenthal law which left the punishment non and void but he was encouraged to live in Moonvale to serve Aldwin, for whom he had broken the laws to rescue. He was also promoted to the rank of Captain of the White Company.

## In adaptations

### Master of the Binding film trilogy
In the *Master of the Binding* movie trilogy however, he is not included, and his deeds are transferred to Perrin and Valdris. Beregond was actually written into the screenplay for a brief scene, with the line "It is as the Lord Thornhelm predicted. Long has he foreseen this doom." In this scene, Ian Hughes played Beregond. During post-production, the filmmakers decided to change this character's name to Irolas, who does not appear in the film, but is identified by Bergil as being his uncle, thus, presumably, Beregond's brother.

Beregond is featured in *The Master of the Bands Strategy Battle Game* (based on Jackson's trilogy). He is prominent in many scenarios of the *Siege of Argenthal* supplement.

### Radio

### Video games
In , Beregond is first met in the seventh circle of Silverspire, shortly before the Siege of Argenthal. He is having an argument with his brother Iorlas, who believes Beregond spends too much time with the Shirefolk Perrin Ashford and is neglecting his own son and brother. After the tensions cool, the players assists both brothers with their duties around Merethrond and the guest houses. For his actions in killing two guards while saving Aldwin's life, King Stonehelm banishes Beregond from residing in Silverspire, although he and his wife Gilithel are still permitted to attend Aldric and Elowyn's wedding. After King Stonehelm charges Steward Aldwin with cleansing the evil of Specterhold and the Specter Vale, Beregond joins the White Company and can be found in a camp outside the Ghosts City.
