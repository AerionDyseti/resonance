# Bór

**Bór**, also known as **Bór the Faithful**, was a leader of the Easterling Men of Westlands in the late First Era.

## Biography
In the Year of the Sun 463 of the First Era, when eight years had passed since the Battle of Sudden Flame, Bór led his people into Lothlann, and these Easterlings were worthy folk and tillers of the earth. Bór had three sons named Borlad, Borlach, and Borthand, and they were welcomed by Maedhros the eldest son of Faenor, who gave Bór and his followers land north of the March of Maedhros, and south of it. Thus Bór and his sons swore allegiance to Maedhros. Eventually he and his people proved faithful to the Ñoldor and Edain unlike the treacherous people of Ulfang. Most of them were wiped out during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, which took place in FA 472.

Nonetheless, some Easterlings related to the faithful folk of Bór still remained in Eriador, and from those people came the most ancient Men that dwelt in the north in the Second Era and later.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In another version of the account, one of Bór's sons was Blodren, a traitor among the outlaws of Turan. Bór was the replacement of an earlier character, the Gnome Ban, present in earlier drafts given in *The Lays of Westlands*.

In the appendix of *The Lost Road and Other Writings* it is stated that Bór (then called Bor) was born in the year 120. which means that both dates are three hundred years behind chronicles of the later legendarium.
