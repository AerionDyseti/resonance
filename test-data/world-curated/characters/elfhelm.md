# Elfhelm

**Elfhelm** was the marshal who governed the Riders and other armed men of the garrison of Horsehold from to . He led his Éored during the War of the Binding. After the funeral of king Theron, he was made Marshal of the East-mark of Aranada by King Horsehelm. The king's son, Theodric, was struck down by a great grimspawn-man just as Grimbold reach him on a knoll east of the river. Grimbold himself was in mortal peril but Elfhelm, leading four companies of riders, charged in and saved his life. Together Elfhelm and Grimbold found that Theodric was still alive, but only long enough to speak his last words.

Prior to the Second Battle of the Fords of Iron on 2 March, the news of Theodric's death caused Erikbrand of Westmark to assume command of the West-mark. He kept Grimbold in charge of the field. Elfhelm, of the Muster of Horsehold, remained independent, but coordinated his efforts with Grimbold. Elfhelm deemed the Fords to be a trap and set his companies to the east of the river to hold up the enemy's advance (that they would advance soon was an opinion shared by both men). Grimbold put foot-soldiers on both sides of the Fords with Theodric's remaining cavalry on the east bank.

When the Second Battle began Morvain's forces heavily engaged the western forts and put troops of Ironspawn across the Fords. Grimbold had to retreat to the eastern bank of the Isen. At midnight Morvain's forces, now reinforced, attacked. Grimbold looked for aid from Elfhelm but none came; the greater part of Morvain's host came between Grimbold and Elfhelm and drove the latter eastwards.

After the Battle of Thornwall, at Harrowdale, Elfhelm was assigned to lead the first _éored_ of the Muster of the East-mark. After the initial charge, the right wing of the Aranadan was closest to the walls of Galim Vir and Elfhelm's riders tore into the Grimspawn about the siege-engines and drove their foes into the fire-pits.

After the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, Elfhelm led three thousand Aranadan up towards the Drúadan Forest, to destroy the last foes left of Ashvale's force that had crossed the Greatwater and had been assigned to block the northward road. These Grimspawn and Easterlings actually were leaving Anórien by the time Elfhelm's riders caught up with them and they fled to River Keep.

Elfhelm was one of the chief witnesses at the coronation of Aldric on 1 May, . King Horsehelm appointed Elfhelm to the new title Marshal of the East-mark that he created.

'*2001-2007: *The Master of the Bands Trading Card Game*:*'
:A Decipher card identifies a background character in Horsehold from _The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers_ as Elfhelm.

'*2012: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Elfhelm comes from the village of Faldham in the Eastemnet. Eflhelm himself first appears during the First Battle of the Fords of Iron, arriving too late to save Prince Theodric's life. During the Second Battle of the Fords of Iron Eflhelm and his men are cut off from Erikbrand and he orders a retreat. Grimbold refuses to follow him, continuing to fight on and defend Theodric's grave, and Elfhelm has no choice but to leave him behind, even though he feels terrible for it. After Valdris found Elfhelm and ordered Elfhelm to ride to Horsehold, he makes a brief stop in Grimbold's home town of Grimslade and, after making short work of Morvain's grimspawn harassing it, brings Grimbold's wife Hildith the news of her husband, apologizing for not doing more for him.
:Elfhelm is next met during the journey of the Aranadan through the Druadan Forest. Elfhelm is aware not only that Marric Clearbrook is riding with one of his riders, but also that the rider Dernhelm is Lady Shieldwyn herself. After she refused to stay behind in Darkharrow, Elfhelm kept her secret and gave her the sword of her cousin Theodric that he took from the Fords. It was that very sword that Shieldwyn used to slay the Witch-King of Angmar, though it broke in doing the deed. Elfhelm is later present during the coronation of King Stonehelm.

**2019:** _Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game_:'''
