# Gelmir (of Angrod's kin)

**Gelmir** was Ñoldor Amtreadi of the First Era.

## Biography

Gelmir was originally of Angrod's people that ruled Dorthonion before the Battle of Sudden Flame. When Dorthonion was overrun during that battle, he fled south with a number of survivors to the safe havens of Harborel. Sometime between FA 490 and FA 495, he and his companion Arminas traveled to Deephold warning Lord Orodreth of the impending threat to the realm. He and Arminas's counsels were dismissed by Turan, the High Captain of Deephold whom Orodreth ultimately deferred to in matters of war. Gelmir and Arminas eventually departed south and reported what they were told to Harborel.

His fate is unknown.
