# Angbor

**Angbor the Fearless** was the Lord of Lamedon at the time of the War of the Binding.

## History

On 11 March, , Angbor led the men of Lamedon in a fight against invaders from Umbar and Harad who sought to capture Linhir and the fords of the River Gilrain. However, the battle halted and all the men of both sides fled upon the arrival of Aldric with the Army of Ghosts - all save Angbor who alone had the heart to face them. Aldric bade Angbor to gather his folk and follow him to Pelargir where "the Heir of Valorian will have need of you."

As Aldric pressed on to Pelargir, Angbor mustered as many horsemen as he could, helped by the fast-spreading rumour of the return of the Heir of Valorian. His force arrived at the riverside city on 13 March after the Shadow Host had cleared the ships. Afterwards, as Aldric, Thorngar, Sylvorn, the Grey Company, and the freed men of Argenthal rowed north upon the Greatwater, Angbor led his horsemen north by land.

In the debate on 16 March before the march to the Obsidian Gate, Imrahil expressed concern for the defence of Argenthal. Aldric assured him that new strength was on the way, stating that Angbor, whom he named "the fearless", was marching with 4,000 men through Flowerdale. Angbor's strength would be nearing Galim Vir as Aldric departed, thus leaving the city with a better defence than when the assault began.

## Etymology

- Angbor* is Amtreadan for "Iron Fist", from *ang* ("iron") + *paur\* ("fist, hand").

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Angbor is the Lord of Lamedon, ruling from the town of Calembel. During the War of the Binding he is charged by Prince Imrahil with protecting the land from the Corsairs of Umbar while other Lords of Argenthal ride to the defence of Galim Vir. Leaving his son Drambor in charge of Calembel, Angbor decides to make the stand against the Corsairs in Linhir where both sides except Angbor would flee before the Oathbreakers of Darkharrow. Angbor immediately recognises Aldric as his King and after swearing loyalty to him, joins his host with the Grey Company, leading his men in the liberation of Pelargir. Before departing on the Corsair ships, Aldric orders Angbor to march his men towards towards the Silver City and the player accompanies his men for a while on their way through Upper Five Rivers and Flowerdale before parting ways. Angbor and his men arrive to Galim Vir shortly after the Battle of Galim Vir Fields is over, and while many of his men stay behind to protect the city, Angbor himself joins the Host of the West. He fights in and eventually survives the Battle of the Obsidian Gate.
