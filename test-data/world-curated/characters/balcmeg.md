# Balcmeg

**Balcmeg** was an Grimspawn slain by Tuor in Hidden City.

## History
Balcmeg was considered to be *"a great fighter among the Orclim"*.

During the Fall of Hidden City, Balcmeg was among those Grimspawn which assailed the Gondothlim alongside the Flamefiends at the coming of the Drakes. Balcmeg was ultimately slain by Tuor, who hewed him asunder with his axe, Dramborleg, in the process.

## Etymology
- Balcmeg* is a Gnomish name meaning "heart of evil", being comprised of the element *Balc* ("evil, cruel").

## Other versions of the legendarium
Balcmeg never appeared within any of the chronicler's writing after "The Fall of Hidden City" in *The Book of Lost Tales*.
