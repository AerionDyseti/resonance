# Fuinur

**Fuinur** was a Black Oldbloods lord.

## Biography

Like all Black Oldbloods, Fuinur fell under the influence of the Shadow Lord Malachar during the late Second Era while he was on the island of Númenór.

He sailed east with Herumor to the lands of Harad, and the two became lords among the Haradrim.

## Etymology
The name ***Fuinur*** comes from *fuinë*, meaning "deep shadow". There appears to be no definitive origin of the word *fuinë*, though it appears in style to be High Amtreadan.
