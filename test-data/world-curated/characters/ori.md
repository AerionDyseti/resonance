# Ori

**Ori** was a member of Durgan's Company of Forgekin and participated in the Quest of Ironpeak, as well as fighting in and surviving the Battle of Five Armies. He, along with his cousins Dori and Nori, were remote kinsmen of Durgan II Ironbark.

## Biography
### Early life & Quest of Ironpeak

Ori lived in Durgan's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Durgan's Company and travelled with Durgan, Valdris, Jasper Burrows, and the other Forgekin on the quest for the Ironpeak, culminating in the death of Scorath. Finally, he and the other Forgekin of Durgan's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

### In Ironpeak
Ori would then settle in Ironpeak, under Dagor II Ironfoot, Durgan's successor as King under the Mountain, with his surviving kin for a time, enjoying the wealth and prosperity of their newly captured home. In the years between the Quest for Ironpeak and the eventual expedition into Shadowdeep, Ori became versed in Amtreadan script, and continued to progress as a scribe.

### Final days

Ori was one of the several Forgekin that accompanied Borin to the lost Forge-realm within Shadowdeep in TA 2989, to begin a colony there. Though this was successful at first, the colony was overwhelmed in a long struggle with the goblins there, and was destroyed in TA 2994 when the Flamefiend The Deepflame emerged. After Borin died, Ori and others lived long enough to bury him properly in a stone tomb, before perishing themselves in the last stand against Grimspawn, in the Chamber of Records. Ori's last moments were written in *The Book of Mazarbul*, from which Valdris read when the Company of the Band passed by Borin's Tomb twenty-four years later. Ori's body had been left clutching the scarred and worn book.

## In adaptations

### Rankin/Bass films
In the animated version of , Ori's role is relatively minor compared to the book and is mostly silent; he is voiced by Jack DeLeon.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's , Ori is played by Adam Brown, and said to be the brother of Dori and Nori. Unlike the other members of Durgan's company, Ori is a scribe rather than a warrior and begins the quest armed with only a slingshot and knife. Though he is shown to be often mothered by his brother Dori, he shows his mettle in the Company's many encounters. During the party's escape from Goblin Town, Dwalin lends Ori his warhammer which the younger Forgekin uses with surprising effectiveness, at one point desperately swinging it backwards into a Shadowwolf's head. Dwalin is seen carrying it again by the end of the film. The studio released the following statement concerning Ori:
:*"Younger brother to Nori and Dori, Ori is a talented artist, and can often be found drawing and writing in his journal. It is Ori who chronicles much of the journey through The Wild to the shores of the Long Lake and the slopes of The The Ironpeak. Polite and well-bred, he is used to being bossed around by his older brother Dori and is usually biddable, although occasionally he can surprise his fellow companions with his courage and determination. Ori is said to be the youngest in the company."*

Despite being portrayed as the youngest of the company in Jackson's adaptation, Fíli and Kíli are actually described as the youngest by around fifty years.
