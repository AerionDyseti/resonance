# Silverbrook

**Silverbrook** was the enigmatic wife of Tom Willowmere.

## History
left|175px|thumb|"Beyond the Old Forest" by Ted Nasmith
Although her origins are uncertain, it has been speculated that she is a river-spirit of the river Willowstream. However, she and Willowmere are enigmas.

According to the Bucklandish poem *The Adventures of Tom Willowmere*, Silverbrook was in the Willowstream when she pulled Tom by his beard under the water-lilies out of mischief, but he ordered her to let him free. One day, he came to the River-woman and asked Silverbrook to be his wife, and the creatures of the Old Forest (the badger-folk and other animals) attended their wedding.

In  Tom Willowmere travelled to the lower reaches of the Willowstream to gather white water-lilies for her, and it was while returning from a lily-gathering expedition that he discovered Tomlen and his companions, and rescued them from Old Man Willow. Silverbrook seems to have used her lilies to recreate her original home in the river: when Tom brought the Shirefolk back to his house, they found a seated Silverbrook surrounded by water-lilies floating in pots of earthenware.

Silverbrook welcomed and tended the travellers to their home. The shirefolk thought of her as a beautiful and calm being, with a beauty resembling an Amtreadi but less exotic to their hearts. Her voice was described as "the song of a glad water ... coming down like silver". The shirefolk would listen to her sing in a voice like rain, and they would imagine rivers and pools.

## Inspiration
the chronicler wrote that Silverbrook "*represents the actual seasonal changes in [river-lands].*"

In her first appearance in the poem, she is displayed  as a typical mischievous water-sprite, responsible for pulling and drowning humans into rivers and lakes.

'*1955: *The Master of the Bands* (1955 radio series):*'
:Because adaptor Terence Tiller thought the age difference between Willowmere and Silverbrook was too big, he made them father and daughter. the chronicler was upset by the change. No actress is credited specifically for the part, though Nicolette Bernard is the only female in the episode's cast list, making it likely she voiced Silverbrook.

'*1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Silverbrook is played by Donata Höffer.

**1992: *Tales from the Perilous Realm* (1992 radio series):*'
:Sorcha Cusack played Silverbrook in the episode "The Adventures of Tom Willowmere".

'*2001: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:Silverbrook is present in the final third of the first episode, along with her husband Tom Willowmere. Unlike Tom (played by Milan Lasica), Silverbrook has no spoken lines, and she is only heard singing harmoniously as Tom and his four shirefolk guests arrive at his house. Silverbrook's briefly heard singing vocals seem to be portrayed by Soňa Norisová (similar to vocals also used elsewhere in the series), but the actress or singer is uncredited.

'*2001-2007: *The Master of the Bands Trading Card Game*:*'
:Although Silverbrook does not appear in *The Master of the Bands* film series, Decipher produced a card for the character. She was portrayed by Amanda Niel.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):*'
:Silverbrook appears at the house of Tom Willowmere. One of the tasks the player has to accomplish is collecting water-lilies for Tom and Silverbrook. She is voiced by Kath Soucie.

'*2007-: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Silverbrook can be found at Silverbrook's Spring in the Old Forest. Silverbrook's role in the game is very minor: she is only involved in two quests and only has a few lines in both. Her origin however, is greatly elaborated upon: she is a River-maiden, a spirit that watches over the streams and rivers. Silverbrook's sisters can be found in the Lone-lands, Nenuial, the Gladden, Gilrain, Serni and Erui. Some show themselves openly, others are secretive and only reveal themselves to the Wise and the descendants of the Oldbloods who had known of River-maidens in the years of old. But some were driven mad by the bloodshed spilled over their waters, or slain and devoured by the servants of the Shadow who then take on their fair appearance.
