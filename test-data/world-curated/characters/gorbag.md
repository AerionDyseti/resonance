# Gorbag

**Gorbag** was the captain of the Ironspawn of Specterhold. He served the Wraithlords who dwelt in the Ghosts City.  

## History
During the peak of the War of the Binding, the Silent Watchers exhibited unease because a Shirefolk, Tomlen Burrows, had passed by them. Gorbag and a patrol then, left Specterhold and were sent to Spider Pass where Shagrat was in command.

On 13 March  Gorbag and Shagrat came across Tomlen, now paralyzed by Venomweave. They ordered Tomlen carried back into the Tower of Spider Pass as their prisoner.  

During their return to the tower Sam, who was wearing the Binding Band, overheard them talking. It quickly became apparent that Gorbag was the more observant of the two, and noticed that the paralyzed shirefolk's cords were cut, meaning that he had a companion: Shagrat said that the Wraithlords were uneasy and that something nearly slipped, and Gorbag corrected him saying that something *had* slipped; Shagrat pointed out that Venomweave got the shirefolk, but Gorbag pointed out that he was not alone, as someone else cut the cords from Tomlen. Shagrat dismissed Gorbag's reasoning by claiming that he always took a gloomy view.  Shagrat, who had been in the tower longer, was able to tell Gorbag that Tomlen was not dead.
