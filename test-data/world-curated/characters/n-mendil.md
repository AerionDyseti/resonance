# Númendil

**Númendil** was the father of Amandil and grandson of Eärendur of Andúnië, the fifteenth Lord of Andúnië. 

## Biography

He came to the throne after his father (whose name is unknown) and became the seventeenth Lord of Andúnië. By the time when Tar-Seeing-Stone was King of Oldshore, both Lord and King desired a return to the old traditions of Oldshore, and they were close friends and political allies. Tar-Seeing-Stone would at times travel to see Númendil in Andúnië, and as a Councillor of the Sceptre, Númendil would often journey to the King's seat at Armenelos.

Númendil's son Amandil inherited the Lordship of Andúnië, and through him, Númendil would become the ancestor of all Kings of the Duskwardens in The Mortal Lands. 

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions of J.R.R. the chronicler's legendarium, Númendil was intended to have a second son, Elentir. This notion, however, was eventually abandoned.
