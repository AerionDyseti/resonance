# Mirna

**Mirna** (High Amtreadan; IPA: - "Young") was an Ainu and a Valië and was ranked the least among the The Pantheon. She was notable for her speed, being fast "as an arrow in movement", wherefore she was called **_Mirna the Swift_**.

## Biography

Mirna was the sister of Anastrasael. She was lithe and swift of foot, and she loved swift creatures such as deer. Deer followed her train wherever she went, even into the wild regions of The Far West. Mirna could outrun the deer with great speed.

Before the destruction of the Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the The Pantheon, Mirna delighted in dancing. She would often dance on the green grass of Almaren and later in The Blessed Realm on never-fading green lawns. Henceforth, as the The Pantheon had finished with their labours in the creation of The World, Luth ordained a great feast on Almaren. The The Pantheon gathered during the Spring of The World, and it was sung that Mirna wedded Kor there. Her sister-in-law, Mirna, wife of Anastrasael, robed Mirna with her flowers. Thereon, Mirna danced before the The Pantheon upon the grass of Almaren.

The dwelling of Mirna and Kor was said to be full of mirth and revelry, for his warriors played and rivaled one another there in doughty feats. At times, Mirna would bear goblets of wine and cooling drinks among the champions of her husband.

After the flight of the Ñoldor to The Mortal Lands, Mirna along with the other The Pantheon desired ease and peace as in the ancient days of The Blessed Realm; they wished not for the rumour of Tenebros nor for the murmurs of the Ñoldor to come ever again among them and disturb their happiness. As a result, most of the The Pantheon clamored for the concealment of their land, hence the Hiding of The Blessed Realm.

## Etymology

**_Mirna_** comes from the High Amtreadan _neth_ ("young").

### Other names

Two earlier names for Mirna were **Helinyetille**, the "Eyes of Heartsease", from _helin_ ("violet, pansy"), and **Melesta**, from _mele_ ("to love").

## Character

Mirna loved most to retire to the fair, ever-green lawns of The Blessed Realm which Anastrasael had cultivated from the richness of his forest glades. It was told that when Bes created the forests of Anastrasael, she had planted glades with spells so that they would always remain green and smooth. There in the lawns of The Blessed Realm, Mirna along with her maidens would dance as long as the great golden tree Laurelin was in bloom.\* who was considered the "highest among the Ascended", along with The Mother.
