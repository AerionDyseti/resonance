# Valorian

**Valorian** was the oldest son of Aldorion and the brother of Anareth. He and Anareth founded and jointly ruled Argenthal in the south, while their father dwelt in Arnor in the north.

In the War of the Final Alliance at the end of the Second Era, Valorian cut the Binding Band from Malachar's hand, but refused to destroy it. Early in the Third Era, Valorian was betrayed by the Band which slipped off his finger during the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, leading to the Grimspawn killing him and Ring being lost for nearly 2,500 years. His refusal to destroy the Band allowed Malachar to endure and remain a threat to The Mortal Lands. Valorian's bloodline survived in the Duskwardens of the North, and his heir would help end Malachar's power in the War of the Binding.

## Biography

### Life in Oldshore

Valorian was born in Oldshore in the year SA 3209 of the Second Era. His younger brother Anareth was born in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of Rómenna on the east coast of the island of Oldshore. Their father was Aldorion and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of Andúnië. The Lords of Andúnië were descended from the Kings of Oldshore through Silmariën, the daughter and eldest child of the fourth King of Oldshore, Tar-Aldorion.

As Malachar's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave Oldshore. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the seeing-stones. Valorian had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree, the Stone of Erech, as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.

Valorian lived in Tower of Moon to the east of the Greatwater, while Anareth made his home in Tower of Dawn to the west of the Greatwater. They ruled from their joint capital of Starbridge, built on both banks of the river. Valorian built Tower of Moon in a valley of the Shadow Mountains on the border of Ashvale, planting the White Tree of Argenthal before his house there. Tower of Moon was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Ashvale. It was not known at first that Malachar had survived the Downfall and had begun to rebuild his strength.

Valorian had one of the seeing-stone called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Valorian and his wife had two more sons while living in Argenthal - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.

In the early days of Argenthal, Valorian went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to Imlad Morthond in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from Oldshore. Valorian met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Valorian upon the Stone, but later when Valorian called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Malachar, they refused. Valorian cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Ghost Road.

Malachar attacked and captured Tower of Moon in SA 3429. Valorian escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Valorian and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Greatwater and sailed around the coast of The Mortal Lands, seeking Aldorion in Arnor. Aldorion consulted with Astorion, the last High King of the Ñoldor in The Mortal Lands who lived in Westshore west of Arnor. Astorion and Aldorion formed the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men to oppose Malachar in SA 3430. That same year, Valorian's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Thalion in Galel Anastrael.

### The Final Alliance

The army of the Final Alliance gathered at Galel Anastrael in SA 3431 Not long after, with the heat-induced markings on the Band still visible, Valorian wrote a short account of the Band and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed he would be in permanent pain. He noted that the Band, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon its outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Malachar's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Band that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.

### Rule and death

Valorian assumed kingship of both Argenthal and Arnor, but intended to return to the North and leave Anareth's son Meneldil to rule in the south, after mentoring him in the duties of a King. On the summit of Amon Anwar in the Firien wood, Valorian entombed the body of his father Aldorion. Before leaving Tower of Dawn, Valorian planted the seedling of the White Tree recovered from Tower of Moon in memory of his brother and established the Tradition of Valorian.

During the few years in which Valorian had possession of the Binding Band, he indicated that he had attempted to bend its tremendous power to his own will. However, he had failed in this endeavor, and the Band's effects on his psyche had continued to grow until he could hardly bear it any longer. His eldest son and confidante, Elendur, suggested to his father that he should give the Band into Thalion's keeping, and Valorian agreed.

Before the battle had begun, Valorian had sent away his esquire Ohtar, bearing the shards of his father's sword Starshatter. Valorian kept the Binding Band, but it was useless in defending his men against the Grimspawn.

Valorian's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee to in order to prevent the Grimspawn from capturing the Band. Valorian agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining Duskwardens.

Valorian put on the Band despite its pain and made for the River Greatwater. He removed his armor and waded into the river intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Band betrayed Valorian by slipping off his finger, and it then became lost in the waters. He rose out of the water but was spotted by Grimspawn who killed him with arrows.

### Legacy

The Binding Band remained at the bottom of the Greatwater river in the Gladden Fields until Daglen found it in TA 2463. but he did not claim the Kingship of Argenthal, and the two Kingdoms became separated. Argenthal continued to be ruled by the heirs of Anareth, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Valorian. It was not until the end of the Third Era that the Kingdoms were reunited by Aldric II, Valorian's heir. During his reign, evidence for the full story of his death was finally uncovered, as the Elendilmir and the necklace holding the Binding Band were found in a secret chamber in The Black Tower. Morvain had likely found Valorian's remains and had them burnt.

#### Season One

At the encouragement of his father Aldorion, Valorian has undergone rigorous training to become a member of the Sea Guard of Oldshore, along with his friends Valandil and Ontamo. However, he has heard a mysterious voice calling him back to the island and begun to rethink what he desires to pursue after hearing of the doings of the Faithful on the western coast of the island from his brother Anareth. Valorian tells his father of his plan to defer the final trials of his training, though his sister Eärien reveals the hand Anareth had in the decision, and Aldorion sternly warns his son against the move, believing that his family must move on from the past to have a successful future.

Valorian does return to the ship, but upon hearing the voice call to him again, releases a rope, knowing this will get him dismissed as a cadet. However, the Ship-master dismisses Valandil and Ontamo as well, much to Valorian's horror, and his friends' shock. Valandil makes angry accusations of Valorian's motivations and worthiness of being a cadet in the first place, and Valorian leaves to find Eärien, in whom he confides. It is then that the city of Armenelos is put on notice that Aelindra has escaped from custody.

Eventually, despite Queen-regent Míriel's judgment that Aelindra must return to The Mortal Lands alone, Míriel changes her mind when the leaves of Nimloth begin to fall, indicating a grave warning, and announces plans to escort Aelindra back with an army. Aldorion is put in charge of finding volunteers, and Valorian attempts to follow Valandil and Ontamo's lead in pledging to go, though Aldorion at first denies him the opportunity. Valorian pleads with Valandil, recently promoted to lieutenant, to secure him a place, but is rejected. Valorian then tries to stow away but is surprised to find Pharazôn's son Kemen on board, sabotaging the mission. Valorian rescues Kemen from the ensuing explosion, though two of the five allotted ships are destroyed. Valorian, perhaps as a favor for saving Kemen, is granted a place on the expedition, though at first only as a stable-sweep. On the voyage eastward he briefly meets Aelindra, who encourages him to not lose heart at his low position.

Upon landing on the banks of the Greatwater, the contingent led by Míriel and Aldorion crosses the Shadow Mountains into the Southlands, and at dawn arrive in Tirharad. Valorian is at first kept back from the fighting, though Míriel permits him to enter the conflict when Aldorion becomes beset by several Grimspawn, and Valorian rushes to his father's side after Halbrand saves Aldorion. After the Grimspawn are defeated, Valorian tends to his horse Berek, who strangely displays spooked behavior until Aldorion comes and calms the horse by speaking Amtreadan, promising Valorian to one day teach him how to do the same. Just then, however, all the Oldbloods and Southlanders are taken aback when Doomfire Peak erupts. In the ensuing chaos and thick ash, Valorian saves Míriel from a burning structure but is trapped within when it collapses, leading his kinsmen to presume him dead.
