# Finwë

**Finwë** was the first King of the Ñoldor who led his people on the journey from The Mortal Lands to The Blessed Realm in the blessed realm of The Far West. He was a great friend of Elu Thingol, the King of Greyvale. He was the father of Faenor, Fingalor, Finarfin, Írimë, and Findis. As founder of the House of Finwë, he and his first and second wives were the sires of the three noble houses of Faenor, Fingalor, and Finarfin, who afterwards ruled great realms in The Mortal Lands and succeeded him in The Far West. His bloodline also mixed its way into the race of Men.

## Biography

Finwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and his father (although the identity of his father is largely pre-canon) was the direct descendant of Tata and Tatië. When the Pantheon God Anastrasael found the Amtreadi during his travels in The Mortal Lands, he loved them and urged them to travel with him to The Blessed Realm to see its wondrous beauty. The Amtreadi, however, were suspicious of this call and were afraid. Anastrasael chose ambassadors from the three Amtreadi kindreds—the Amtreadi, Ñoldor, and Liinadi—to return with him to The Blessed Realm. They would, in turn, report what they had seen to their kin. One of these ambassadors was Finwë, who, along with Ingwë and Elwë, went to the Blessed Realm with Anastrasael. When they returned, they were able to convince the Amtreadi to go on the Great Journey into the far west.

There was great friendship between Finwë of the Ñoldor and Elwë of the Liinadi. Then each became leaders of their own Amtreadi-kindred. Thus, Finwë became the Lord of the Ñoldor who led his people on the Great Journey. And eventually, Finwë and the Ñoldor arrived in The Blessed Realm directly behind the Amtreadi. There he and his people settled and Finwë thus became the _First High King of the Ñoldor_.

Finwë started a family, first marrying Míriel Serindë who had also come with her people the Ñoldor to The Far West. They had a son called Faenor, but her labors in giving birth to him drained her of most of her life, and she surrendered her soul to the Halls of Neth shortly after bearing him. After a long period of mourning, Finwë felt keenly the loneliness that followed, despite his son's best efforts to mitigate them.

In time, Finwë understood that he wanted more children but was once more devastated when he learned that Míriel had chosen not to be re-embodied and return to him. Finwë therefore resolved to take a new wife; this decision however created a stir within the ranks of the The Pantheon. The Primordial had originally decreed that Amtreadi marriage be, like their lifespan, unbreakable and everlasting and Amtreadi only ever married once in their immortal lives. Finwë was compelled to take his case before Luth, but the petition proved very difficult as the The Pantheon could not force Míriel to return against her will, but they also felt it was injustice for Finwë's happiness to be constrained by her choice. As a result, the Statute of Finwë and Míriel was passed, which established the precedent of an Amtreadi divorce, severed the marriage of Finwë and Míriel and allowed Finwë to remarry.

Finwë's second wife was Indis of the Amtreadi. Indis bore him four children: Fingalor, Finarfin, Findis, and Írimë.

When Tenebros, now free from the Halls of Neth, began spreading lies amongst the Ñoldor attempting to corrupt them, Finwë sought to moderate his people and lead them back to the The Pantheon. But it was too late; the Ñoldor had already begun to envision for themselves plans and new dominions they could rule in The Mortal Lands and were proud. Faenor in particular mistrusted the The Pantheon and believed Tenebros's lies. He began to hoard his treasures and would only allow his beloved father or his sons to see the Starstones. He also began to suspect his half-brother was trying to usurp him as the favored son, and made trouble in Starhold by drawing his sword on Fingalor. For this he was banished from the city, but Finwë loved his elder son greatly and shared his exile. They went northward and built the fortress of Formenos.

There Finwë lived with his son and his grandchildren and some of the rest of his house. Later, when Faenor was summoned to Valmar to make peace with Fingalor, Finwë did not go out of bitterness over the exile of his son; nor did he wish to meet the rest of his people because he no longer felt like their king. Thus he was slain in Formenos when Tenebros, seeking the Starstones, attacked it. This act was the catalyst that led to the Revolt of the Ñoldor.

## Etymology

Finwë's name is not fully translated. The glossary in translates _Fin_ as "hair"; other sources say that it means "skill".

## In other versions

The story of Finwë went through many revisions by J.R.R. the chronicler. A precursor to the character of Finwë was likely the Gnome **Nólemë**. In one of the earliest accounts, the father of Faenor was **Bruithwir**, son of Maidros. In another, the leader of Gnomes in the Great Lands was **Gelmir**, son of Golfinweg and brother of Gwindor. Thus, he had as lieutenants his sons Golfin, Delin, and Oleg. His standard "bore upon a silver field a crown of gold". Later, the name **_Golfinweg_** was reused for Finwë himself. In the battle died Fingalor and his father. Thus, Turgon, Fingalor's son, led the sons of Faenor, who was caught and tortured, and his people after the battle.

In J.R.R. the chronicler's first drafts of the genealogy, Finwë had four sons: Faenor, Fingalor, Finoran, and Finrún. However, the last son was dropped, and Finarfin replaced Finoran as Finwë's youngest son.

In a later version, Finwë had three daughters added by Indis: Findis (as their first child), Faniel (as their third), and Finvain (as their youngest). In yet later versions, Faniel was apparently dropped, while Findis and Finvain were kept. Finvain (renamed _Írimë_) was moved to being just younger than Fingalor, making Finarfin again the youngest child of Finwë.
