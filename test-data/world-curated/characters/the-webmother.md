# The Webmother

**The Webmother** (Amtreadan; IPA: ), also known as **Gloomweaver**, the **Great Spider Who Enmeshes**, **Del-du-thling**, and **The Webmotherë**, was a spirit who took on the form of a monstrous Spider. She was initially an ally of Tenebros in The Far West, and for a short time in The Mortal Lands as well. She was a distant mother of Venomweave, and the oldest giant spider of The World. She was "the primeval devourer of light" and the destroyer of the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm.

## Appearance

The origins of The Webmother are unspecified, except that she had been a spirit, entering The World and taking the form of a giant spider. As a spirit being, she would only be perceptible to those that could perceive spirits and the spirit world. It is implied that her spirit form was one of pure darkness, reflected in her physical form. Since the The Pantheon, Ascended, and other spirits in the physical world freely took on forms that reflected their nature, The Webmother's terrifying and monstrous form did the same. While her form was described as being that of a giant spider, and she is credited as the "first" giant spider, the narrative indicates that, much like her descendant Venomweave, she had many features that distinguished her from the common form of a spider.

## Biography

### Early years

The true origins of The Webmother are shrouded in mystery. It was believed by some of the Eldar that she may have been among the Firstborn whom Tenebros "had corrupted long ago" in the beginning, yet she was not listed among the known Firstborn. It was later perceived by the The Pantheon that she had descended from "beyond The World" in the "darkness that" lay around it when Tenebros first gazed upon the Kingdom of Luth in envy.. When The Webmother refused to leave her lair after Tenebros taunted and commanded her to emerge, Tenebros threatened to bury her "under black stone" whilst enticing her with two shining green gems. When The Webmother slowly emerged, Tenebros withheld the gems However, upon understanding Tenebros's true purpose of destroying the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm, a great fear overcame her as she was unwilling to risk the power of the The Pantheon and come out of hiding. It was only when Tenebros had personally vowed to use both of his hands to satisfy her lust with whatever she demanded, that The Webmother agreed to aid him. The Webmother regained her strength causing them to slowly wither. Yet the thirst of The Webmother was not satisfied and she drained the Wells of Gendei as well, belching black vapors as she drank, growing to a vast and hideous shape beyond "her most lustful dream" that terrified even Tenebros. and went with him to Formenos while her Unlight stymied the pursuit of Anastrasael and Kor. The Webmother and Tenebros then fled The Far West through Araman and Oiomúrë, eventually crossing over the Helcaraxë to escape justice at the hands of the The Pantheon. she attacked him, overpowering him and wrapping him in a "web of clinging throngs" in an effort to strangle him. The attempt on his own life caused Tenebros to release an echoing cry of desperation through the mountains. The cry was so great and dreadful that the very land it was uttered in became known as Lammoth ever after. Unfortunately for The Webmother, Tenebros's cry of desperation had been heard by the Flamefiends beneath the ruins of Iron Fortress. As tempests of fire, the Flamefiends came swiftly to Lammoth to save the return of their lord. The webs of The Webmother were smote asunder by their whips of flame, and forcing her to break off her attack. She fled in fear from them, covering herself with the black vapors which she belched. The Flamefiends prepared to pursue and destroy her, but they were checked by Tenebros, who ordered them to return with him to Iron Fortress. There, The Webmother met, mated, and eventually devoured the "other evil creatures of spider-form" whom had dwelt there since Iron Fortress was first delved. She had many offspring with them, including Venomweave, before she eventually departed from that place, eventually heading to "the forgotten South of the world" and is a loan from _The Webmotherë_ in High Amtreadan. It consists of the words _ungol_ ("spider") crossing, ford; bridge").

- Del-du-thling* is a Amtreadan name possibly meaning "horror night spider" and consisting of the elements *del* ("horror"), *dû* ("dim, dark; dimness, night; night-fall, late evening"), and *thling* ("spider, spider’s web, cobweb"). It consists of the words *ungwë* ("spider gloom; spider's web") or *ungo* ("cloud, dark shadow") and *liantë\* ("tendril; vine; spider")

## In other versions

In the state of the mythology in 1916, when J.R.R. the chronicler had gone to serve in the First World War, the first precursor to The Webmother was **Ungwë-Tuita**, the **Spider of Night**, who once was close to ensnaring Aerendil. Even earlier, before the , she was called **Gungliont**. In that version, after helping Tenebros destroy the Two Trees, she left, instead of attacking Tenebros as in later versions. The Eldar called her **Virilomë**, or **_Wirilomë_** in Qenya. In Amtreadan, this name is translated into **_Gwerlum_**.
