# Durgan II

**Durgan II** "**Ironbark**", eventually called **King under the Mountain** or **Mountain King**, was the son of Thragol II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thragor and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Durgan was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Scorath and for leading an alliance of Men, Forgekin, and Amtreadi in the Battle of Five Armies.

## Biography
### Early life

Durgan II was born in TA 2746 to the Forgekin prince Thragol II in Ironpeak. Early in his youth, Durgan and the other Forgekin of the Ironpeak were forced to flee by the wyrm Scorath, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Shadowdeep, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Forgekin armies beneath Shadowdeep's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Ironbark," which remained with him even in death.

Durgan became King-in-Exile of Grundin Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.

### Quest for the Ironpeak
In TA 2941, Valdris the Grey found Durgan in The Wanderer's Rest at Crossway and set in motion a scheme to retake the mountain. He gave Durgan a map and key that he had received from Thragol in Dol Guldur before he died. Durgan then took a contingent of twelve Forgekin to visit Jasper Burrows in order to hire him as a burglar for their mission. Durgan intended to infiltrate the Ironpeak and retake the treasure from Scorath.

The Forgekin, Jasper, and Valdris encountered many dangers on their journey to the Ironpeak, surviving Stonelurks, Grimspawn, Shadowwolves, and Spiders. He found the legendary sword Grimcleaver in a stonelurk-hoard, along with Foebreaker. In Galel Anastrael, the Company rested and Thalion translated the Moon-letters on Thragor's Map. During their journey through Gloomwood, Durgan and his Company encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Amtreadi King Thornael. They escaped in barrels and traveled down to Lake-town.

Durgan and Company were greeted warmly by the people of Lake-town and hailed as the return of the King under the Mountain. They soon reached the Ironpeak and the Forgekin sent Jasper inside, who conversed with a newly awakened Scorath. Realizing that the Lake-men must have helped the intruders, an enraged Scorath flew towards Lake-town to take revenge. There he was killed by Braden the Archer, who pierced the bare spot on Scorath's left breast with his black arrow.

Following the death of Scorath, the people of Lake-town asked Durgan for a share of the treasure, as they wanted recompense for the destruction of their home, a part of Scorath's treasure originating from their former city, and because a man of Lake-town who shot the fatal arrow that killed Scorath. Durgan, overwhelmed by greed after recovering his family's riches, and enraged by the presence of Thornael, refused to share any part of the treasure. Instead, he sent a Raven to seek aid from his relative, Dagor Ironfoot, who sent a force of Forgekin soldiers on the move to secure the reclaimed mountain city. Meanwhile, Durgan charged his companions with looking for the Heart of the Mountain of Thragol within the hoard of treasure, and gifted Jasper a Truesilver Coat for his bravery. However, Jasper had already found the Heart of the Mountain, and subsequently, brought it to Braden and Thornael in secret to use as a bargaining counter.

The growing conflict over the treasure between Forgekin, Amtreadi, and Men, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly averted by the approach of goblin and shadowwolf armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their common enemies in what was later called the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Durgan led an assault that proved his strength as a leader, striking out from the mountain and providing vital aid as the goblins threatened to overwhelm his allies. He fought courageously, but was mortally wounded in the battle, requiring Bjorn to take him to safety.

## Personality
[[File:Durgan king under the mountain by gravity zero-ddur2td.jpg|thumb|200px|left|© by [https://www.deviantart.com/gravity-zero gravity-zero] ]]
Durgan was smart, proud, brave, intelligent, vengeful, and a bit stubborn. He was sophisticated and noble but tended to treat his allies as equals. He was respected by many throughout The Mortal Lands.

While he initially shared the greed of his family and had an extensive love for gold, he valued the welfare of others as well. He was immensely brave and was willing to give himself up for a just cause, until dragon-sickness came over him.

After succumbing to Dragon-sickness, he seemed to be cruel, stubborn, and vain, and overvalued the treasure of Ironpeak. He was obsessed with possession of the Heart of the Mountain, since it was the heirloom of his family and part of the Mountain itself. However, in his last moments after the battle, his true noble self returned, and he asked Jasper for forgiveness. His death had a profound effect on Jasper, as he had considered Durgan a great friend and brother.

## Weapons
Durgan fought using typical Forgekin axes, a bow, and swords, as well as an Amtreadi blade called *Grimcleaver*, which was given to him by Valdris the Grey (Valdris had found it in a Stonelurks' lair). Under Thornael's imprisonment, the blade had been confiscated by the Wood-amtreadi. 

At Durgan's burial, Thornael decided it was more appropriate to place it on Durgan's tomb, and did so, along with the Heart of the Mountain.

Ľubomír Roman voiced the character in the 1989 Slovak two-episode radio miniseries adaptation of *The Shirefolk*.
