# Valdric

**Valdric** was the eldest son of Thornhelm II and Finduilas and the older brother of Aldwin.

Valdric was beloved by his father and was like him in face and pride, but in little else. Valdric's temperament was similar to King Eärnur of old; he took no wife and was more interested in arms and warfare. He cared little for lore, save for the tales of old battles. Between the brothers there was great love, and had been since childhood, when Valdric was the helper and protector of Aldwin. He was only ten years old when their mother Finduilas died, and after her death their father became more grim and silent than before. Near Tharbad he crossed the Greyflood using a dangerous ford formed by a ruined bridge and he lost his horse, which returned home to Aranada. The rest of the way he travelled on foot.   

When he reached Galel Anastrael, he attended the Council of Thalion. Representatives from races and lands of the Westlands spoke about the current situations, and Valdric spoke about the Council of Argenthal's vigilance and the struggle to keep the forces of Ashvale from crossing the Greatwater. However, he said, he had not come seeking military aid but counsel. When he told of the dream that had led him to Galel Anastrael the answers to its riddles were revealed: Aldric brought out the Shards of Starshatter and Tomlen Burrows the Shirefolk held up the Binding Band that was Valorian's Bane. There he attempted to persuade the Council to let him take the Binding Band to Argenthal so that it could be used in the defence of the realm. Thalion explained, however, that the Band could not be used by anyone other than Malachar. For even though one might use it for the purpose of doing good, it would twist all deeds and intentions to evil in the end. This saved the Company from freezing to death when they got caught in a blizzard on Redhorn. The next morning Valdric and Aldric ploughed their way through the snow and carried the four Shirefolk back down the mountain to safety.

As the Redhorn Pass was now blocked, Valdric proposed that they should travel southward on the west side of the Misty Mountains and then either pass through the Gap of Aranada or cross the Isen and go through the southern lands of Langstrand and Five Rivers. But Valdris opposed this saying that, because of Morvain's treachery those lands were no longer safe. He proposed that the Company should instead go through the mines of Shadowdeep, but Valdric said that he would not go that way, not unless the whole company voted against him.

Valdric finally agreed, but upon reaching the Doors of Grundin he was angry that Valdris did not know the password and he threw a stone into the Dark Water. This alerted the Watcher in the Brook. When Valdris stepped into the mines the Watcher attacked Tomlen, but all the Company were able to escape into the mines.

Aldric then led the Company towards Goldwood. Valdric advised against this, saying that the woods had a perilous reputation in Argenthal and that few escaped unscathed. Aldric replied that only those who were evil or brought evil with them had reason to fear Goldwood. After Aelindra had spoken to each member of the Company in their thoughts, Valdric was keen to know about the conversation between the Lady and the Band-bearer, but what he thought that the Lady had offered him he would not tell. When the Company were set to depart from Goldwood, Aelindra gave each of them a gift. Valdric received a golden Belt.

As the Company set out down the Greatwater, Valdric shared a boat with Marric and Perrin. As they travelled down the river, Valdric became increasingly consumed with thoughts of the Band. He muttered to himself and bit his nails and sometimes paddled closer to Tomlen's boat. His behaviour made Marric and Perrin uneasy, and Perrin noticed a strange glint in Valdric's eye as he looked at Tomlen. As the Company approached the rapids of Sarn Gebir it was Valdric who alerted them and they were able to turn back. Valdric then advised the company to leave the river and strike a westward and southward road to Argenthal. But Tomlen did not intend to go to Argenthal, hence the Company continued on their way down the river.

### Breaking of the Company
When the Company reached Nen Hithoel, it was time for the Company to decide their next course. When Tomlen wandered off into the forest to think, Valdric followed him after a while. He tried to persuade Tomlen to bring The Band to Silverspire. As Valdric spoke, the lure of the Band grew stronger in him. He envisioned himself as a mighty king who would overthrow Malachar, rescue his people beyond hope, and lead Argenthal to victory and glory. When Tomlen refused to accompany him to Silverspire, Valdric became enraged and stressed and tried to take the Band from Tomlen by force. Tomlen put the Band on and vanished. When Tomlen had gone, Valdric was overwhelmed with the realization of what he had done. He wept and called for Tomlen to return, but it was too late.

When Valdric returned to the Company he would only say that he had argued with Tomlen and that the shirefolk had disappeared. Marric and Perrin ran off looking for their friend, and Aldric told Valdric to follow them and guard them.

Valdric was still alive when Aldric found him. At least twenty Grimspawn lay slain around him. Valdric still held his sword, though the blade had been broken off at the hilt, and the Great Horn had been cloven in two. Before he died, Valdric told Aldric that he had tried to take the Band from Tomlen. He asked Aldric to forgive him, that he had fallen to the lure of the Band, but Aldric assured him that he was forgiven and that he had redeemed himself before he died. Then Aldric, Thorngar, and Sylvorn laid Valdric's body in one of the boats. His shattered horn and sword they laid across his lap and the weapons of his enemies were laid at his feet. Aldric and Sylvorn sang the Song of Valdric while they set his funeral boat adrift on the Greatwater. The river then carried Valdric's body over the Greatfalls-falls.

## Etymology
**See also: Valdric (Lord of Ladros): Etymology and Borlach: Other versions of the legendarium*

Valdric was named after Valdric (Steward of Argenthal).

- Valdric* is mentioned to be one of the few Solaaran names of mixed forms. It has been suggested that the name *Valdric* consists of Amtreadan *boro(n)* ("steadfast") and High Amtreadan *míre* ("jewel").
## Genealogy

## Inspiration

Many similarities have been suggested between Roland, the paladin of Charlemagne, and Valdric: both bore a white horn, were military leaders who defended their lord's realm, shared the flaw of pride and both died tragically away from home in the wilderness while defending their companions against an overwhelming enemy force and blew their horn before their death. Like Roland in battle with the Saracens blew his horn to call for Charlemagne, Valdric called for Aldric. In both cases, help came too late.

'*1955: *The Master of the Bands* (1955 radio series):**
:Derek Prentice voiced Valdric.

**1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:Michael Graham Cox provided the voice of Valdric. His appearance was inspired by the popular image of a Viking: he wore a fur tunic and a horned helmet. He did not have a shield.

**1979: *The Master of the Bands* (1979 radio series):**
:Erik Bauersfeld provided the voice of Valdric.

**1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):*'
:Cox reprised his role of Valdric. In the meantime, he learned to pronounce Amtreadan words correctly: he came from "My Nasty Rith" in Bakshi's film, but he uses the correct pronunciation here.

'*1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Valdric is played by Christian Redl.

**2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:*'
:Valdric is played by Sean Bean. Differing from the book, Valdric dies (killed by the Ironspawn leader Lurtz) at the end of the film instead of the beginning of *The Two Towers*. He also fights without his shield in his last battle.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):**
:James Horan provides the voice of Valdric, clad in blue and carrying a great shield. His death is not shown; he is not seen again after the first camp at the foot of Hill of Sight.

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:*'
:Extended Edition includes a scene not taken from the book in which Valdric and his brother Aldwin see each other for the last time, which displays their father Thornhelm's attitude toward his two sons. At the Council of Thalion in Galel Anastrael, Valdric says that his prophetic dream came to first his brother, Aldwin, and then to him, on the night before an attack on Starbridge. This reference to Starbridge may be the inspiration for the flashback scene in The Two Towers.

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:**
:Valdric is seen in a brief flashback being pierced by arrows, as Perrin explains to Thornhelm the circumstances of his death. In the Extended Edition, he is seen again in a vision of Thornhelm, walking proudly towards his father until he fades away.

**2001: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Valdric is provided by Jozef Vajda. The same actor also portrayed Valdric's brother Aldwin later in the radio series.

'*2004: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands*:**
:Valdric is the Hero unit of the Argenthal faction and also appears in the storyline campaign. In a notable deviation from the original story, the player may save Valdric on Hill of Sight, in which case he will accompany the Three Hunters into Aranada, participate in the Battle of the Thornwall and late journey with Valdris and Perrin back to Argenthal. He will also fight during the Siege of Argenthal and participate in the last stand of the Tyrran folk in the Battle of Obsidian Gate.

**2006: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II*:**
:Valdric is now the Hero of the Tyrran folk faction.

**2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:The players first meet Valdric in Galel Anastrael and later again during the Company's stay in Goldwood. He can also be played during his stand against the Ironspawn at Parth Galen.

'*2012: *LEGO The Master of the Bands*:*'
:A mini figure of Valdric is included in the set The Mines of Shadowdeep, he wears a sword and shield. In the *Lego The Master of the Bands: The Video Game* in 2012, Valdric's death and funeral scenes are softened by various comedic elements such as being shot by an arrow, a broom, and a banana. In the cutscene that plays after the player achieves 100%, Valdric's spirit also appears at the Mistport with the other members of the Company of the Band to see Tomlen and Valdris off on their voyage.
