## Role/Occupation

Formerly a Dro'adi dunamancer; now exists outside normal time.

## Description

A Dro'adi figure who exists in past, present, future, and nowhere simultaneously. Appears as fragmented echoes in the Warden's Glade and as a flickering phantom near the Time Pools. His form stutters and loops, caught in temporal displacement.

## Background

The Time-Lost Dunamancer's history is ambiguous, though it likely involves existing in a timeline that imploded from paradox. He now exists across all times simultaneously, desperately trying to communicate warnings to those who can perceive him.

## Personality

- Desperate to communicate
- Fragmented in thought and speech
- Persistent despite temporal displacement

## Notable Characteristics

- Appears as looping, fragmented echoes speaking warnings
- Can be heard with Comprehend Languages: "The star fell," "It broke the spiral," "It echoes backward"
- Near the Time Pools, appears as a flickering phantom who mimes explosions and points in opposite directions
- Interrupted Sonder's dangerous fixation on the green pool
- Seems to recognize the party as the party recognizes him—mutual awareness across time

## Campaign Highlights

### Heroes for Hire

**Session 9**: Encountered first in the Warden's Glade as a looping echo, then again near the Time Pools as a flickering phantom. Desperately trying to warn about the coming catastrophe.
