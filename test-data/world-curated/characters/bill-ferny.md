# Bill Ferny

**Bill Ferny** was a man of Crossway, known to be an associate of the Wraithlords and later, a ruffian of the Chief's Men.

## Description

Descriptions of Ferny's appearance are limited to his being a "swarthy Crossway-lander" or a "sneery swarthy fellow."

## History

Bill Ferny lived in the last house of Crossway, and was an opportunistic backstabber who was little liked by respectable folk of the town. He also served as a spy for the Shadow Riders, and relayed information about Shirelands-shirefolk to them.

On September 29th of , Ferny and his associate were at The Wanderer's Rest when the two of them saw Mr. Underhill vanish into thin air. They reported the information to the Shadow Riders.

After reporting to the Shadow Riders, Ferny and his allies went to the inn's stables and set all mounts loose. There was only one pony left in all of Crossway: Bill's mistreated one. He sold him for twelve silver pennies to Wanderer and the Shirefolk. As a parting gift, Colben Greenhand threw an apple at his head.

Ferny's associate was spotted inside his house when the company set out to Windcrest.

After the Ruffians among the Southerners were kicked out of Crossway, it was believed by Barliman Butterbur that Bill Ferny and Harry Goatleaf opened the gates to let them in since the two of them sided with Ruffians in the battle that followed. After fleeing Crossway with the Ruffians, he threw in his lot with the Men serving Lotho Sackwell-Burrows in the Shirelands. He guarded the outer gate at the Clearbrook Bridge as the Chief's Big Man and his command over the local Sheriffs was hard. When the four Travellers returned to the Shirelands, he attempted to threaten them, but was threatened by Marric Clearbrook in turn, and as such he fled into the night after giving him the gate key, though not until after his old pony had kicked him in his back. He was never heard of again.

## Etymology

- Bill* is a name the chronicler used to represent the Common Tongue name **Bil**, which was a short for names as *Arambil*, *Bildad* and *Bilcuzal*, all of unknown meaning. *Ferny\* is a reference to the plant, as many surnames of Crossway were botanical in nature.

## Other versions of the legendarium

In an earlier draft of The Scouring of the Shirelands, it is Tomlen who threatens Ferny rather than Marric. Later, Sam compares Ted Sandyman to Ferny.
