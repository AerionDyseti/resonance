# Éowyn

**Éowyn** was a member of the House of Eorl and the niece of King Theron of Aranada. She was renowned for slaying the Specter King of Coldreach. She was the daughter of Théodwyn, Theron's sister, and Éomund of Eastmark; her brother was Éomer. Following the end of the War of the Binding, she and Aldwin were married, and she bore one son, Elboron.

She was also known as the Lady of Aranada, Lady of the Shield-arm, the White Lady of Aranada, and Lady of Moonvale.

## History

Following the death of her parents in , Éowyn and Éomer were brought into Theron's house and raised there. Éowyn grew to be tall and slender, with a grace and pride that came from her mother.

Éowyn revealed her temperament when Aldric was to ride into the mountains and take the Ghost Road. Unable to dissuade him, she desired to accompany him, declaring herself "weary of skulking in the hills," with a "wish to face peril and battle." However, Aldric reminded her of her charge to govern the people until the king's return and left without her.

Later, when the forces of Aranada were mustered to go to Argenthal, Éowyn disguised herself as a man, and under the alias of **Dernhelm**, travelled with the Riders of Aranada, carrying with her Marric, who was also ordered to remain behind.

During the Battle of Silverspire Fields, she fought by King Theron, and when he was struck down by the Specter King of Coldreach, she took it upon herself to defend the King of Aranada. Confronting the Specter King, who boasted that "no living man may hinder me", she removed her helmet, revealing her long golden hair and declaring:

- "No living man am I! You look upon a woman."*

Though he was filled with doubt at her unveiling, the Specter King fought her, and broke her shield and arm with his mace. Yet before he could strike her down, Marric, who had not been heeded by the Specter King, struck him behind the knee with a Barrow-blade, crippling the wraith, and giving Éowyn the chance to thrust her sword between the crown and mantle, which shattered the blade. Thus Éowyn slew the Specter King with Marric's aid, and fell upon her fallen foe, seemingly dead.

She was granted the title "Lady of the Shield-arm" after the battle in recognition of her triumph, as her shield-arm had been broken in the fight.

Shortly afterwards, Éomer found Éowyn beside Theron, and, believing that both his sister and the King were dead, was filled with grief and fury. Taking the kingship of Aranada, he ordered that Theron and Éowyn be taken to the Citadel. Éowyn was borne away alongside Theron in honour, as she had fallen into a death-like sleep from the Black Breath, and was presumed dead. However, Prince Imrahil recognised then that she yet lived, and instead ordered that she be taken to the Houses of Healing, where she would receive help.

Éowyn was severely injured, and because of the Black Breath of the Wraithlords, she faced certain death; however, she was treated soon after by Aldric during his brief sojourn into Silverspire. After a while she awakened, and since she had not yet recovered fully, she was not permitted to join the Host of the West that would march on Ashvale. However, whilst recovering in the Houses of Healing, she met Aldwin, with whom she later fell in love.

Later, Éowyn settled in Moonvale, of which Aldwin was made the ruling Prince. She was thereafter known as the *Lady of Moonvale*. Éowyn and Aldwin were married, and dwelt together in the hills of Emyn Arnen in Moonvale. She kept her friendship with Marric, and when he became Master of Brookshire in , she sent him great gifts, as did her brother from Aranada.

They had at least one son (likely Elboron), and their grandson was Barahir, who wrote *The Tale of Aldric and Elowyn* in the Fourth Era.

## Etymology
- Éowyn* means "Horse-joy" or "lover of horses" in Old English (being a combination of her parents' names: Éomund and Théodwyn), the language the chronicler adapted to represent Aranadan.

Éo- sounds like "eh-ah" with the "ah" just barely pronounced, while *y* is the modified *u*,

## Other names
The "White Lady of Aranada" title was given by Aldwin to Éowyn of Aranada when they were together looking out from the walls of Silverspire and saw the huge cloud that rose above Ashvale at the fall of Malachar on 25 March . 

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In an early rough note, Éowyn was originally known as "*Shieldwyn Elfsheen daughter of Theron*". In the first drafts of her appearance, she was split into two characters: Éowyn, sister of Éomer, and Idis, daughter of Theron. the chronicler eventually discarded Idis as Éowyn overshadowed her, and planned to have Éowyn wed Aldric when he became the King of Argenthal. However, the chronicler cut out the love story, deciding to make Éowyn "*the twin-sister of Eomund, a stern amazon woman*", and possibly dying to save or avenge Theron.

## Analysis
Just as MacDuff disconcerted [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Tragedy_of_Macbeth Macbeth] by revealing he was not "of woman born", Lady Éowyn found the loophole in the 1,000-year-old prophecy by Aurindel, fulfilling that the Specter King would not be slain by a man. However, the Specter King actually recited the prophecy incorrectly: he said that "no living man may hinder me," though the prophecy actually said that "not by the hand of *man* will he fall." Aurindel's prophecy, unlike his own version, implies that the Specter King will not fall to a man. In the chronicler's writing, man and woman applies simply to the gender of any The Mortal Lands race. Only when he capitalised Man did it denote the race of Men. The Specter King may not have realised that the prophecy meant only a male, thus, his moment of doubt and hesitation when he faced Éowyn.

'*1955-6: *The Master of the Bands* (1955 radio series):**
:Olive Gregg provides the voice of Éowyn.

**1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:Éowyn is briefly seen, but has no lines.

**1979: *The Mind's Eye's The Master of the Bands*:**
:Éowyn is portrayed by Karen Hurley.

**1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):**
:Éowyn is voiced by actress Nellie Bellflower. She appears unintroduced, but Marric fills Perrin (and so the spectator) in on the details. She is not terribly wounded, and appears healthy beside Aldwin at the coronation.

**1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):**
:Elin Jenkins plays the part of Éowyn. She is introduced much earlier than in the book when Valdris escapes from Ironspire and borrows a horse from Theron. Unlike some adaptations her recovery in the Houses of Healing, and the blossoming of her relationship with Aldwin are included. She is last encountered in the penultimate episode gifting Marric the horn he would blow later during the scouring of the Shirelands.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Éowyn is played by Donata Höffer.

**2002-3: *The Master of the Bands* (film series):*'
:Éowyn is portrayed by Miranda Otto. Jackson's adaptation shows two different explanations for Éowyn's injuries after fighting the Specter King. In the Theatrical Release, her wounds are less severe than in the book; she is conscious but hurt, as opposed to unconscious. In the Extended Edition, she is near death; her brother finds her and grieves, and later she is healed in the Houses of Healing, where she meets Aldwin.

'*2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Éowyn is provided by Diana Mórová. Éowyn is alluded to in *The Two Towers*, but has no lines. She appears fully in *The Return of the King*. Her role is identical to that in the books.

'*2013: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Éowyn is first encountered in Horsehold, shortly before the arrival of Valdris and the Three Hunters. After King Theron departs with his host, the player stays behind and helps Éowyn with various preparations before moving the citizens to Darkharrow. As Dernhelm, she travels to Silverspire with permission of Elfhelm, who keeps her secret and gives her the sword of her late cousin Theodric, taken from the Fords of Iron. It is the very sword that Shieldwyn uses to slay the Witch-King of Angmar, though it breaks in doing the deed. After healing from her wounds, she attends the coronation of King Stonehelm, but departs for Horsehold prior to Aldric and Elowyn's wedding.
