# Aelindra

**Aelindra** was a Noldorin Lady who witnessed The Mortal Lands during the Three Ages. 

Aelindra was born in The Far West as one of the Amtreadi. She was the daughter of Finarfin and Eärwen as well as younger sister to Finoran Felagund (later King of Deephold), Angrod, and Aegnor. She took part in the Exile of the Amtreadi, following Faenor in his rebellion. However, she opposed the Kinslaying at Alqualondë and crossed the Helcaraxë with the rest of Fingalor's followers. After arriving in Westlands, she lived mainly in Greyvale, where she befriended Melian. Later, with her husband Caelorn, she ruled over the woodland Amtreadi of Goldwood, and together they had a daughter, Celebrían, who married Thalion. 

She is described as "the mightiest and fairest of all the Amtreadi that remained in The Mortal Lands", and the "greatest of Amtreadi women". Throughout the Third Era it was unknown who wielded the Three Bands, but during the War of the Binding, Aelindra revealed to Tomlen Burrows that she was the bearer of Band of Water. After the War, she returned to the Uttermost West.

## History
### Elder Days
#### Life in The Far West

Aelindra was born in Eldamar in the Year of the Trees 1362. She was the fourth child of Finarfin, prince of the Amtreadi, who named her ***Artanis***. Her mother was Eärwen, princess of the Liinadi, who named her ***Nerwen*** ("Man-maiden"). Aelindra grew beautiful and tall, even for the women of the Amtreadi, being strong of body, will, and mind, "a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days of their youth."

Indeed, "she was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats". This custom was the origin of her Amtreadan name ***Aelindra*** ("Maiden crowned with gleaming hair"), which was given to (and accepted by) her much later, in Westlands. The gleaming of her hair was not a mere poetic reference: her hair was held a marvel unmatched. It mingled and surpassed the gold hair of her father and the starlike silver of her mother, so the Eldar said that both lights of the Two Trees were captured in her tresses. It was also said that this first gave the idea to her uncle Faenor of capturing the merged light of the Trees, which would result in the making of the Starstones. He asked her three times for one of her tresses, but she always refused. Faenor and Aelindra were always unfriends, both being the greatest Eldar in The Blessed Realm; and if Faenor was greater than she, she was wiser, and her wisdom grew with the long years. For she also had an outstanding gift to see into the minds of others, and, though she judged most with kindness, she hated and feared the darkness in Faenor, not perceiving that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the Amtreadi, including her own. Like the rest of the House of Finarfin, she was also supportive of the Exile by the desire to aid their Amtreadan relatives in The Mortal Lands. during the troubles that followed she fought fiercely against Faenor by defending her mother's kin during the Kinslaying at Alqualondë and the rape of the ships. Afterwards, she even desired to follow Faenor to disturb him in all the ways that she could, but nothing could have moved her to return since she had begun her way to exile, as her pride was strong then as it was thereafter.

#### Arrival to The Mortal Lands

Once in Westlands, those of the House of Finarfin were eager to enter Greyvale, but King Elu Thingol received the Amtreadi coldly, and only allowed entrance to those invited by him after some inquiries. Finally in , Finoran and Aelindra became long guests in Greyvale, but her brother eventually departed to the Caverns of Narog to establish the stronghold of Deephold. Aelindra did not go with him, and remained in Greyvale with Caelorn, a kinsman of Thingol, as there was great love between them. Despite their love, they did not marry each other, following the custom among the Eldar of avoiding marriage and child-bearing during the war, but they were eventually betrothed till the war ended. Meanwhile, she dwelt with Queen Melian, from whom she learned much of the wisdom of The Mortal Lands. It is safe to assume Melian benefited from this.

Years passed in Greyvale, and Aelindra became dear to Melian, and they spoke often to one another about The Blessed Realm. Melian was eager to learn the causes of the Exile of the Amtreadi, but Aelindra would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. In the year , Melian asked her directly about this, and Aelindra revealed the story of the Starstones and how the Amtreadi fled from The Far West against the will of the The Pantheon, though she still left out the Oath of Faenor, the Kinslaying, and the burning of the Ships at Losgar. Melian was able to discern a darkness that was left unsaid, but Aelindra refused to tell her more. Thus, Thingol became concerned regarding the Amtreadi, and he was informed soon afterwards of the Amtreadi's dark deeds in The Far West, and it chanced that the children of Finarfin were visiting Aelindra in Greyvale. Egged on by his accusing words, Angrod told everything, and Aelindra's brothers departed heavy-hearted. when the kingdom of Deephold was finished and a feast was held for all the children of Finarfin. She dwelt for a while in Deephold, and in this time she asked Finoran why he remained unmarried. Her brother answered with dark foresights about his kingdom. Aelindra heard another foretelling, as Melian told her about a Man who shall cross into Greyvale moved by a doom greater than the Girdle of Melian.

Aelindra did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the War of the Jewels, but she might have been well informed of the deaths of her brothers Angrod and Aegnor during the Battle of Sudden Flame; and of Finoran's, while he was held in captivity by Malachar in the year . At some point before the Fall of Deephold in , she and Caelorn passed over the mountains Being one of the chief leaders of the Noldorin rebellion, Aelindra was not allowed to return and a ban was set upon her, to which she replied that she had no wish to do so.

### Second Era

At the beginning of the Second Era, Caelorn and Aelindra dwelt for a time in Westshore, south of the Lune, while Astorion ruled in the north. Both left Westshore before the years 10-20, when Astorion became king in that land, apparently thanks to her influence. They entered Eriador and dwelt for a while around Lake Nenuial, being followed by many Amtreadi, Grey-amtreadi and Green-amtreadi. They were considered the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador. Probably around , Aelindra and Caelorn had a daughter: Celebrían. Caelorn was not fond of Forgekin, but she saw the importance of getting close to them, for she saw military interests even with them. Also, she was a Noldo, and therefore close to them in mind and in the passion for crafts; and in The Blessed Realm she had learned from Yavanna and Aulë, the creator of the Forgekin himself.

About the year , Malachar came in disguise to Eriador, but he was only welcomed in Eregion by Celebranor and the Amtreadi-smiths, who were interested in his advice on craftsmanship. "*He perceived at once that Aelindra would be his chief adversary and obstacle, and he endeavoured therefore to placate her, bearing her scorn with outward patience and courtesy*". At the same time, without her knowledge, Malachar influenced Celebranor and his Gwaith-i-Mírdain against Aelindra and Caelorn. Finally, he moved them to expell Aelindra from Eregion at some time between  and 1400. Thus, Aelindra and Celebrían left through Shadowdeep to Lórinand, although Caelorn would not enter the Dwarvish realm and remained in Eregion. but of their whereabouts during the final millennia of that Age nothing else is known.

### Third Era
#### Rule in Goldwood
In early Third Era, in the year , Aelindra and Caelorn's daughter Celebrían wedded Thalion the Half-amtreadi. who, being a good friend of Valdris, recommended that he be made head of the Council. But this distinction fell instead to Morvain.

The Grey Council would not take action until Valdris discovered that the shadow growing in Dol Guldur was Malachar. After deliberating, the Council joined forces and drove Malachar out of Dol Guldur in .

#### War of the Binding

Aelindra and Caelorn were well informed about the Company of the Band, its members and their mission, before its coming to Goldwood, perhaps informed by messages from Galel Anastrael. In the evening of 17 January of , the Company arrived at Silvertree. Coming to the talan of the Lady and Lord, each member was greeted by name by Caelorn. Noticing that Valdris was missing, Aelindra asked where he was, for she wished to speak with him. Hearing that they had encountered The Deepflame and that this was in fact a Flamefiend from ancient times, Caelorn criticized the passing of the Company through Shadowdeep. However, Aelindra was more sympathetic, especially towards Thorngar, who bowed to her in respect. Before inviting the members of the Company to rest and heal there, she looked deep into their eyes and they all felt their hearts exposed.

Among the gifts was the Elfstone, which she gave to Aldric from Elowyn "*as a token of hope*". Aelindra stated she was unsure as to what to give Thorngar, and asked what he wanted. After complimenting her beauty, he requested a single strand of her hair. Instead, she rewarded him with three strands, which he promised to put into an imperishable crystal in memory of her. And last, to Tomlen, she gave a a small crystal phial specially prepared by her, which contained the light of the star of Aerendil.

The land of Goldwood was not exempt from the battles of the War of the Binding: between 11 and 18 March, the Galadhrim suffered three assaults from Dol Guldur. Soon afterward, Aelindra threw down the walls of the fortress and opened its pits.

Two years later, on 22 September , On 29 September, they reached the Mistport and departed over the Sea. Thus ended the Third Era. And in , it is said that Thorngar went to the West out of his desire to see Aelindra again. He may have been allowed thanks to her intervention.

## Etymology

- Aelindra* is a Amtreadan name translated by the chronicler as "maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance", and "maiden crowned with a radiant garland". *Aelindra* consists of *galad* ("light, radiance") + *rî* ("crown").

the chronicler notes that the element *galad* had no relation to Amtreadan *galadh* or Liinadi *galað* ("tree"). Due to this coincidence the name *Aelindra* was occasionally rendered as ***Galadhriel***, as the chronicler explains:

## Other names
At the time of her birth, Finarfin named his only daughter ***Artanis***. Her father-name meant "Noble Woman" in High Amtreadan, from *arta* + *nís*.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

### The History of *The Master of the Bands*
The first appearance of the character of Aelindra in the legendarium was during the composition of *The Master of the Bands*. The first reference J.R.R. the chronicler ever made to her was in some notes for the "Goldwood" chapter, which mentioned that a "Lord of Galadrim and a Lady" went to the Grey Council. The following phrases are a stub of them receiving the Company of the Band, both clad in white and with white hair. In other isolated notes about this chapter, the chronicler wondered "if Aelindra is alone and is wife of Thalion."

The first mention of "Keleborn and Aelindra" by name was in the narrative of the following chapter, although the chronicler considered other Amtreadan names before writing *Aelindra* in ink. There Aelindra describes Keleborn and herself as "*wise beyond the measure of the Amtreadi of The Mortal Lands*", and says that they "*have dwelt there since the Mountains were reared and the Sun was young*", from which Christopher the chronicler deduced they were both conceived as exiled Amtreadi.

In a list of matters "to be explained before the end", the chronicler wondered about what happened with Aelindra after the War of the Binding:

In sum, earlier and rejected names during the composition of *The Master of the Bands* were *Finduilas*, *Rhien*, *Galdrin*, *Galdrien*, *Galadhrien*, and *Galadrien*.

### Expanding the First Era
In the Appendix F of *The Master of the Bands*, the chronicler had already stated that Aelindra was "of the royal house of Finoran, father of Felagund, Lord of Deephold" (in the Second Edition, the chronicler changed the names to *Finarfin* and *Finoran Felagund*, respectively). Although not using much detail, the chronicler was thus introducing Aelindra in "The Starstone Tales" tradition, and having finished *The Master of the Bands*, he began the work of expanding the backstory of the character. Aelindra enters this tradition in the *Annals of The Far West*, in which she is first mentioned when the chronicler decided the children of Finoran (later Finarfin) would be related to Thingol through Eärwen. In the *Annals*, written after the publication of *The Master of the Bands*, Aelindra stands out by being valiant and the only woman leading the Exile of the Amtreadi, but there is no explanation of the nature of her rebellion or its later impact on her life.

Indeed, Christopher the chronicler explains that when the chapter "Farewell to Goldwood" was written, his father had not conceived the idea of a ban upon Aelindra's return due to her role in the Flight of the Amtreadi. In a letter from 1953 (even before *The Master of the Bands* was published), the chronicler did not object to the comparison of Aelindra with the Virgin Mary, a comparison he would object to later. 

Written in the same years, the *Grey Annals* follow the *Annals of The Far West*, telling the chronology of Westlands, mainly after the Return of the Amtreadi. Here Aelindra's rol is briefly expanded, limited to her relation with Melian and a conversation with her brother Finoran. The darkness pending upon all the Amtreadi is explicitly mentioned, but the same happens with the innocence of the children of Finoran (later Finarfin) during the discussions with Thingol and Melian. Sadly, the chronicler left these *Annals* unfinished at the point of the Wanderings of Huran, so nothing is told about Aelindra at the end of the First Era, neither about her relation with Caelorn.

### Expanding the Second Era
After the publication of *The Master of the Bands*, the chronicler most expanded the story of Aelindra in the Second Era in "Concerning Aelindra and Caelorn". This manuscript is the only full narrative dealing with this matter, but sadly it is a stub full of corrections, and the chronicler never solved some contradictions that would be raised later. Christopher comments that what is now remarkable is that there is still no presence of the idea of a ban upon Aelindra's return: she stays in The Mortal Lands out of her love for Caelorn. There could be some pride on her part, as she was eager to visit The Mortal Lands, but later she stays in Eriador after the first fall of Malachar as a sort of duty until he was finally defeated.

### Unstained exile
In a letter written in August 1973 (one month before his death), the chronicler gave a completely different description of Aelindra: 

This was not an isolated idea; around the same time he wrote an outline of the revised backstory of Aelindra, which he could not carry into narrative, as it ended up being probably his last writing related to the legendarium. Here Aelindra is described as totally opposed to Faenor from the beginning, and she felt confined in The Far West and desired to depart to The Mortal Lands in order to exercise her talents: "for being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the The Pantheon thought fit to give the Eldar". Manwë was probably aware of her desire and he had not forbidden her to depart, nor given permission yet. Nonetheless, Aelindra did not remain inactive and thought in the ships of the Liinadi, so she dwelt in Alqualondë with her mother's kin. There she met Caelorn (here a Telerin prince and her cousin), and both planned to build a boat and seek the permission of the The Pantheon to depart to The Mortal Lands. 

But then Tenebros and The Webmother destroyed the Two Trees, and Faenor began his rebellion, in which Aelindra had no part. "Indeed, she and Caelorn fought heroically in defence of Alqualondë against the assault of the Amtreadi, and Caelorn's ship was saved from them". Now Aelindra sailed in despair without asking Manwë, and indeed she would have been told to stay in The Blessed Realm in that hour, despite her desire being legitimate; and thus the ban against departure fell upon her and she was forbidden to return. She and Caelorn reached The Mortal Lands before Faenor, finding Harborel's haven and being received with joy. They did not join the war against Tenebros, which they considered hopeless without the help of the The Pantheon, and instead they recommended going eastwards and befriending the Raknagadi and Men living there. But the Amtreadi of Westlands did not heed these counsels, so both of them crossed the Ered Westshore before the end of the First Era. They were granted permission to return by the The Pantheon, but they rejected it.

Christopher the chronicler explains that this change probably had its roots in the philosophical implications of Aelindra's power in The Mortal Lands. He is certain that his father had the intention of changing all the narrative of "The Starstone Tales" related to the backstory of Aelindra, despite what was already written: after all, she was not part of the story of the Amtreadi in the first place and the book had not been published. The only notable problem is in the backstory of Caelorn, which contradicts what was already published in J.R.R. the chronicler's life. It is unclear which version was written as definitive, but Christopher the chronicler chose the former one for Chapter 15 of his edition of *The Starstone Tales*.

;:Passing over the mountains
Christopher the chronicler explains that in the first conception, Aelindra went to the east from Westlands alone and found Caelorn (probably of Nandorin origin) in Goldwood. Hence in the chapter "The Mirror of Aelindra" she said Caelorn dwelt in the West before the Dawn, and that she crossed the mountains from Westlands (apparently alone). This contradicts the information in Appendix B of *The Master of the Bands* and in *The Road Goes Ever On*, in which Caelorn is a Sinda who accompanied Aelindra from Westshore.

;:Marriage of Aelindra and Caelorn
In Appendix B, while describing the beginning of the Second Era, it is said that Caelorn dwelt in south Westshore with his wife Aelindra, so it appears that they were married at this point. In a manuscript from 1965, while the chronicler pondered about Amroth being their child, he wrote that Aelindra and Caelorn were betrothed, but did not marry until the confusion of the War of Wrath and the beginning of the Second Era had ended (till S.A. 24). For more details see *Amroth#Other versions of the legendarium*.

;:Founder of Eregion
In Appendix B, it is said that at the beginning of the Second Era, the Amtreadi went to Eregion out of their interest for the truesilver in Shadowdeep. Besides, Celebranor is called "Lord of Eregion", with no mention of his relation with Aelindra. It is unclear if these texts are necessarily contradictory, but it is clear that trying to explain the rule in Eregion remains problematic.

### The published *Silmarillion*
Christopher the chronicler was aware of his father's latest conception, in which Aelindra left The Far West free of any guilt. However, as this was a mere projected idea, he had to make use of the completed narratives for his edition of *The Starstone Tales*, in which she is a rebel leader.

### Films
'*1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:Aelindra is voiced by Annette Crosbie.

**2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:**
:Aelindra is played by Cate Blanchett. Aelindra narrates the Prologue, explaining the creation of the Bands of Binding and the War of the Final Alliance. Earlier plans considered were to have either Tomlen or Valdris narrate the Prologue, but this was dropped: Tomlen was not alive until thousands of years after these events happened, and although Valdris was alive, he was not present in The Mortal Lands at the time; the Wizards came some one thousand years after the Prologue ends. Thus Aelindra narrates the Prologue, because she had first-hand accounts of this history and actively participated in its events.

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:*'
:Aelindra frequently consults telepathically with Thalion; in the books there is no clear indication of how Aelindra knew about the coming of the Company. In the film, unlike the book, Aelindra and Thalion send an army of Amtreadi - led by Vorniel - to Thornwall Keep to aid the Aranadan. In the DVD commentary, Peter Jackson and his fellow writers explain that they worried audiences would wonder why the Amtreadi do not seem to be helping in the war, while at the same time, they felt that actually inserting an entire separate battle scene at Goldwood would take up too much screen time and resources.

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:*'
:A spiritual apparition of Lady Aelindra appears to provide Tomlen strength following his passage through Venomweave's Lair soon after he uses the Vial that she gave him. She is later seen leaving The Mortal Lands along with other Ring-bearers, but in film version her husband Caelorn departs with her at the same time.

'*2012-14: *The Shirefolk* (film series):*'
:Cate Blanchett reprised her role as Aelindra, although the character is absent from the novel. She appears as part of the Grey Council alongside Morvain, Valdris and Thalion. Later, right before Durgan and his Company enter in Gloomwood, she telepathically urges Valdris to further seek the true identity of the Dark Sorcerer. Finally, during the attack on Dol Guldur, Aelindra plays a larger role. She first rescues Valdris from captivity, and is ultimately the one to drive Malachar from the fortress using her phial, although weakened by the amount of power she used.

### Television
**1993: Hobitit:**
:Aelindra is portrayed by Heidi Krohn. She appears only in the episode *Goldwood*, and she is featured as a reflection on the surface of the lake.

**2022: The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding:**

:Aelindra is portrayed by Morfydd Clark as one of the central characters of the series. Lady Amelie Child Villiers portrays Young Aelindra in Episode 1 as a child.

### Radio series
'*1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):*'
:The voice of Aelindra is provided by Marian Diamond. In addition to the Goldwood episodes, the voice of Aelindra is heard in Venomweave's Lair as a reminder to use the phial, and she appears with Thalion in the final episode in the Shirelands, as they journey towards the Mistport.

'*2001-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Aelindra is provided by Soňa Norisová. Norisová also provides most of the singing in the series (including the opening and closing titles theme and series closing song), alluding to Aelindra being a secondary storyteller (with Jasper Burrows serving as the series' primary storyteller).

### Games
'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):**
:Aelindra, voiced by Jennifer Hale, is the narrator of the Prologue and the Epilogue, and appears in Goldwood.

**2006: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II*:*'
:Aelindra is the strongest of "Hero" units available to the Free Peoples. If a player's army manages to spot Creepkin on the battlefield, take The Binding Band from him and deliver it to their forces, the option to "summon" Aelindra unlocks for a large amount of resources. Thus, Lady Aelindra is represented as succumbing to corruption of The Band, similar to the respective scene in the *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* movie.

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Introduced in *The Master of the Bands Online: Mines of Shadowdeep*, Aelindra plays a prominent role during the Epic storyline with guidance and support. During the final days of the War of the Binding, Aelindra assembles the Council of Amtreadi Lords, where it is decided to bring their armies against Dol Guldur. After she brings down the walls of Dol Guldur, Aelindra accompanies Elowyn on her journey south to her wedding, and they visit the site of Celebrian's captivity in the Misty Mountains together. Afterwards, she and Caelorn join the procession of Thalion's house and travel to Silverspire to attend the wedding of Elowyn and Aldric.

**2014: The Mortal Lands: Shadow of Ashvale:**
:Aelindra is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character. She is voiced by Jennifer Hale and she narrates the prologue in a showing of the game.

**2017: The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War:**
:Aelindra is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character, with Jennifer Hale reprising her role from the game.
