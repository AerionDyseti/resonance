# Fredric Barleycorn

**Fredric "Fatty" Barleycorn** was a Shirefolk of the Shirelands. He was one of the close friends of Tomlen who knew that he had the Band and helped him with his mission to leave the Shirelands. 
## History
### Ancestry
Fatty was a descendant of Hildibrand Ashford ( - ), one of the many sons of the Old Ashford. He was the son of Odovacar Barleycorn and Rosamunda Ashford. Fatty was born in  and his family was from Budgeford in Bridgefields of the Eastshire. He also had a younger sister, Estella Barleycorn (b. ), who would eventually marry Marric Clearbrook. 

Fredric was a good friend of Tomlen Burrows. In  he was a guest at Jasper's Farewell Party. 

Tomlen eventually came to his house, along with Sam and Perrin. It was there when the conspirators revealed themselves to Tomlen, and expressed their will to follow him in his mission. Fatty however was a typical shirefolk who had never left the Shirelands and was unwilling to do so, but would play his role; he stayed behind to keep up the pretence that Tomlen was there, by wearing his clothes and keep the house occupied, and deal with any "inquisitive folk". 

After hearing that Tomlen was pursued by the Shadow Riders, Fatty was given the option to flee with the others into the Old Forest, but that didn't seem any more inviting to him despite Marric's attempts to persuade him that the Riders were far more terrifying than the stories about the Old Forest. Fredric opted to remain behind as a decoy for the Wraithlords and as a messenger for Valdris in case he showed up.

The Wraithlords did eventually come in the night of 30 September to Crickethollow for Tomlen and the Band. But Fatty, though frightened nearly witless, escaped to raise the alarm of Brookshire, causing the Clearbrooks to sound the Horn-call of Brookshire. This caused the Wraithlords to flee, but they had learned that the Band was gone.

### Resistance
During Morvain's rule of the Shirelands, Fatty led a group of partisans fighting against the Ruffians in the Brockenbores around the hills of Scary before eventually being captured. He was imprisoned in the Lockholes and starved, (and could no longer be called "Fatty") but was rescued after the victory of the Battle of Bybrook.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In early versions of the text (cf. *The Return of the Shadow*), his name was **Hamilcar Barleycorn** and was rescued by Valdris from Shadow Riders before reaching Galel Anastrael, narrating to the protagonists Valdris's adventures. His larger role was later abandoned.

His role survives as a minor anomaly in the published *The Master of the Bands* - before the four Shirefolk go into the Old Forest, they have *six* ponies prepared (Fatty was originally supposed to go with them). The number was corrected to *five* in the 50th Anniversary Edition.
