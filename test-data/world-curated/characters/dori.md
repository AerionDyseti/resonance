# Dori

**Dori** was a Forgekin of Grundin Folk, who, along with his brother Nori and cousin Ori, travelled with Jasper Burrows and Durgan II as a member of Durgan's Company on the Quest for Ironpeak, to reclaim the Ironpeak from the wyrm Scorath.

Dori was among the Forgekin at Burrow's End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest of Ironpeak. He was noted by Durgan to be the strongest of the thirteen companions.

## Biography
### Early life
Before the Quest of Ironpeak, Dori lived in Durgan's hall in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Durgan and Company, befriending Jasper Burrows and traveling with him in search of Scorath's treasure at the Ironpeak.

### Quest for Ironpeak
It fell to Dori to carry Jasper Burrows in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains during the escape from the Goblins, but Dori dropped Jasper, and the other Forgekin and Valdris blamed him for "losing their burglar." Later, during their escape from the Shadowwolves and Grimspawn, Dori helped Jasper climb a tree to get away from the shadowwolves. Jasper shortly thereafter saved Dori by grabbing his legs as they were rescued by the Skywardens and taken to the Great Shelf from the Misty Mountains. When Valdris tells their tale to the skin-changer Bjorn and brings forward the company, Dori came first, along with Durgan. 

### Later life
Dori fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies. He likely returned to the Ironpeak, where he survived up until the time of the Council of Thalion and the War of the Binding, most likely fighting in the Battle of Dale, though his exact death date is unknown.

## In adaptations
### Peter Jackson's *The Shirefolk*

In the  by Peter Jackson, Dori is played by Mark Hadlow.

The studio gave this description of the character in the trilogy:
:*"A distant relative of Durgan Ironbark, Dori is the eldest amongst his brothers Ori and Nori. He is the strongest in The Company of Forgekin, and spends much of his time watching out for Ori, making sure he hasn’t caught a chill or gotten himself killed by Shadowwolves or Goblins. Eternally pessimistic, with a natural tendency to expect the worst, Dori is nonetheless quite prepared to risk life and limb in order to get the job done."*

In , writer Jude Fisher describes Dori as fancying himself as something of a sophisticate, with a liking for good wine, beautiful jewelry, and fine clothes; the rest of the company see him as a dandy, as shown by the way he braids his beard into a silver case. Yet he is still one of the most formidable fighters in the company with both his Forgekin sword and flail. After being caught by the wood Amtreadi in *The Desolation of Scorath*, Dori and the rest of the company are stripped of their weapons and he later receives a human longsword from the Lake-town armory.

Dori is shown often mothering his younger brother Ori in the films. It was said by Mark Hadlow that Nori drives him (the character Ori) mad. In , as the Company entered Bjorn's house, Dori tells Ori to stay away from the door, and then says: "It's not natural. None of it." This is the exact same quote as Colben Greenhand said to Tomlen Burrows after climbing down their Amtreadan rope in the beginning of the film adaptation of .
