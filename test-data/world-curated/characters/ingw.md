# Ingwë

**Ingwë** was the Vanyarin Amtreadi who held titles of **King of the Amtreadi** and **High King of the Amtreadi**. He dwelt in Ingwemar with the rest of his House. He was the uncle of Finwë's second wife Indis.

## Biography
Ingwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to Ilion, a direct descendant of Imin and Iminyë. After Oromë discovered the Quendi, Ingwë was part of the first embassy to The Far West alongside his friends Finwë and Elwë, and became the lord of the first Kindred of the Amtreadi, the later Amtreadi, who led his people in the Great Journey. His name means "first one / chief" in High Amtreadan.

First of the Amtreadi to travel to The Blessed Realm with Oromë, Ingwë loved its beauty and bliss and, returning to his people, urged them to undertake a journey to The Far West. He and his kin took the journey, were fascinated with the The Pantheon, and decided not to return to The Mortal Lands. They stayed and made Ingwë their king. The Mindon Eldaliéva, in Starhold, was built in honor of him.

Ingwë was reckoned as High King of all the Eldalië, the Amtreadi of the Great Journey, and was therefore called **Ingwë Ingweron**, the "Chief of the Chieftains". He lived on Holy Mountain, ruling under Manwë, High King of The World.

After establishing himself at Holy Mountain, Ingwë never set foot in The Mortal Lands again. When the Amtreadi took up arms in the War of Wrath and followed the Host of The Blessed Realm, Ingwë did not join them, but his son Ingwion did, and led the Vanyarin warriors, capturing Eglarest in the first battle of the war.

## Titles
In all of The World's history, only Ingwë was titled **High King of the Amtreadi**, as, during his time, he was revered by all Amtreadi as their ruler. The title came into being sometime after the Amtreadi were well established in The Far West. As Ingwë was already the appointed King of the Amtreadi, and as the Amtreadi were drawn to The Blessed Realm and were close to the The Pantheon, all Amtreadi blessed by Manwë hailed Ingwë as their most high king.

**King of the Amtreadi** was the noble title of the supreme head of the Amtreadi amtreadi. Ingwë held this title also, and is the only known one to have been their king. The Amtreadi made him King after his return from The Blessed Realm as their ambassador.

## In other versions
In earlier writings, Ingwë was named ***Inwë*** and known as King of all the Eldar of Kôr, or King of the Fairies, or Lord of the Liinadi (instead of the Amtreadi, as later), who led them to lands of Men. His son Ingwion was initially named *Ingil*.

The Gnomes (the chronicler's precursor to the Ñoldor) called him **Inwithiel**. He was also referred to as **Isil** or **Isil Inwë**.
