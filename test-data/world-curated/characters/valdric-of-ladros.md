# Valdric of Ladros

**Valdric** was an Adan of the House of Bëor.

## Biography

Valdric was the elder son of Boron, the third chieftain of the folk of Bëor, and the great-grandson of Bëor the Old. He also had a younger brother named Belegor, about whom little is known. Valdric became the fourth Chieftain of the House of Bëor after the death of his father. When the Amtreadi kings decided to grant lands to the chieftains of the Edain, Valdric was granted the land of Ladros in Dorthonion as a fief under the Amtreadi-lords Angrod and Aegnor, the younger sons of Finarfin (the Ñoldorin king in The Far West) and the brothers of King Finoran of Deephold. He thus became the first Lord of Ladros. 

Valdric was the father of Bregor, his first child and only son, Andreth his second child and elder daughter, and Beril his last child and younger daughter.

Two later Lords of Argenthal and warriors of renown were named after Valdric son of Boron, including Valdric of the Company of the Band.
