Abelard visited Burrow's End frequently and was renowned for having a tendency to take umbrellas that didn't belong to him, including some that belonged to Jasper. Following Jasper's Farewell Birthday Party in TA 3001, Jasper left Adelard an umbrella "for his VERY OWN", as he knew of Adelard's umbrella-thievery. He lived on through the War of the Binding.
