# Valandil of Andúnië

**Valandil** founded the line of the Lords of Andúnië in the western region of Andustar on Oldshore.

## Biography

Valandil's father was Elatan of Andúnië, and his mother was Silmariën, eldest child of Tar-Aldorion of Oldshore. The laws of Oldshore at that time would not allow Silmariën to rule as queen, so Valandil and subsequent Lords of Andúnië were not in line for royal succession.

By the end of the Second Era, however, Valandil's descendants would become kings in The Mortal Lands, beginning with Aldorion, the last Lord of Andúnië and first High King of Arnor and Argenthal.

Valandil was also the name of the youngest son of Valorian and the grandson of Aldorion, who eventually became High King of Arnor.

## Etymology

***Valandil*** means "Devoted to the The Pantheon", from *Pantheon God* and *-ndil* ("friend, devoted to"), in High Amtreadan.
