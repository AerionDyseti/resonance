# Bladorthin

**Bladorthin** was a great **King** of an unknown location within The Mortal Lands, sometime in the Third Era.

## Biography
Sometime during the mid- to late Third Era, Bladorthin ruled a kingdom which maintained armies and had an unspecified trade relationship with the Forgekin Kingdom under the Mountain. and *thin(n)* ("pale; grey") a variation of *thind*.

While J.R.R. the chronicler never elaborated on the meaning of *Bladorthin*, John D. Rateliff noted that the name was "clearly Gnomish (or perhaps Noldorin)". If this was the case, then *Bladorthin* would translate to "Grey Country", "Grey Plains Fay", or "Grey Master of the Plains" and therefore may be comprised of the Gnomish elements *blador* (which "probably applies to wide open country") and *-thin* ("grey").

Like Rateliff, Andreas Möhn also identified the name as Gnomish, however, he claimed that *blador* meant "wide earth, flat earth" and interpreted the whole name as "wide earth-grey" or "Grey One of the wide lands". He also speculated that the High Amtreadan form of *Bladorthin* may have been **Palursindo**.

Unlike them, Michael L. Martinez did not believe that *Bladorthin* was Gnomish, noting not only that the element *-blad* only appeared in *Bladorion*, a name which the chronicler abandoned, but also that the element is similar in sound to "Blaed(a)", an Old English name for "renowned".

## In other versions
In the early drafts of , Bladorthin was the name of Valdris (who would later be assigned the colour "grey" in *The Master of the Bands*) for much of the narrative until the chronicler decided to change it late in the writing process. A connection can still be seen with the element *-thin* ("grey"). This theory is shared by J.E.A. Tyler and Michael L. Martinez, though Martinez also adds that he may have been a King of Dale who reigned long before Girion. The Tolkienwiki not only agrees with the theory of Bladorthin having a premature death, but also theorize that his kingdom was located around the Sea of Rhûn before being destroyed by Malachar. Andreas Möhn disagrees with most of the above theories, particularly the belief of his premature death since *The Shirefolk* never mentioned Bladorthin's death as being premature. As a result, Möhn theorizes that Scorath's arrival in the year 2770 prevented the trade, implying that Bladorthin's death must have been sometime later. He also countered the theory that he was a King of Dale because Dale was never a kingdom before Braden. Möhn therefore identifies that his kingdom was actually located in Dorwinion. In addition, he also suggests that Bladorthin may have been related to the Kings Durgan mentioned who used to send for the smiths of Ironpeak, rewarding "even the least skillful most richly".
