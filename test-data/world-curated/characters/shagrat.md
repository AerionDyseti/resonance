# Shagrat

**Shagrat** was a large, dimwitted, arrogant, long-armed Ironspawn, Captain of the Tower of Spider Pass. He commanded one of two Grimspawn patrols that found Tomlen Burrows after he had been poisoned by Venomweave.

## Biography

In the year TA 3019, Shagrat and his company, along with Gorbag's company from Galim Errav, discovered the unconscious Tomlen Burrows following the shirefolk's encounter with Venomweave, and took him back to the Tower of Spider Pass for searching. Later his Black Ironspawn tower garrison fought over possession of Tomlen's truesilver mail shirt with Gorbag's company, and sent up the Stairs of Spider Pass to investigate matters. Shagrat interpreted his orders literally: all captives to be searched, but left unharmed and they and their possessions taken to The Obsidian Spire. Gorbag coveted Tomlen's mail shirt for himself, and soon a fight over the shirt began. Gorbag wounded Shagrat in the arm with a knife, but was eventually killed by Shagrat. Their respective followers began fighting also, and slaughtered each other over the next several hours.

Later, Colben Greenhand, carrying the Binding Band, infiltrated the Tower of Spider Pass and soon realized that the garrison was effectively wiped out. Shagrat, however, managed to get past him carrying Tomlen's armor and other personal items, escaping and taking them to Lugbúrz (The Obsidian Spire) as ordered.

It is possible that Shagrat was killed by Malachar or the authorities at The Obsidian Spire for the events that occurred at the Tower of Spider Pass. Alternatively, he may have been rewarded for his loyalty by being allowed to march to the Obsidian Gate alongside his fellow Grimspawn and Ironspawn as one of their captains. If so, it is unknown whether he was killed in the battle or the subsequent destruction of Ashvale following Malachar's downfall, or if he survived and fled.

## In adaptations

### _The Return of the King_ (1980)

In _The Return of the King_ 1980 animated film, Captain Shagrat is voiced by Solomon Hersh Frees; he is the Grimspawn guarding entrance to the chamber in which Tomlen is held captive.

### _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's _The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King_, Shagrat is of the same appearance as Ironspawn in prior films. Instead of him, it is Gorbag who in the cave explains Venomweave's eating habits, while Shagrat takes the Truesilver shirt, saying it is his (while Gorbag intended to take it to Malachar), and in the resulting fight, Shagrat escapes with it. (Later in the film the Truesilver shirt appears again at the Black Gates, in the possession of the Voice of Malachar.)

Given Shagrat's adaptational disloyalty, he would almost certainly have been executed by the authorities for going against Gorbag's authority, which was aligned with the Obsidian Spire's interests, and that these authorities brought the Truesilver shirt to the Voice of Malachar.

### Video games

In the video game of _The Return of the King_, Shagrat appears in the level of Spider Pass. After Sam kills Gorbag, Shagrat steals truesilver and runs out of Spider Pass.

In _The Master of the Bands: The Third Era_ (GBA), he appears as a secret villain who can be unlocked after the player finishes the evil campaign in hard level.

In _LEGO The Master of the Bands: The Video Game_, he is a playable character. In the main campaign, he fights Venomweave, alongside Sam (this was done to make the level co-op friendly). Like all Ironspawn, he has super strength, which is used to pull heavy handles.

In , Shagrat is abscent from the main storyline and only makes a brief cameo appearance in a scene depicting how Creepkin was released from The Obsidian Spire.

## In popular culture

The vocalist for the symphonic black metal band [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimmu_Borgir Dimmu Borgir] is named after this Ironspawn, although he writes the name as "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shagrath Shagrath]".

Shagrat's name was also used for British supergroup band "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shagrat_(band) Shagrat]", formed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Peregrin_Took Steve Perrin Ashford] and Mick Farren in 1970.
