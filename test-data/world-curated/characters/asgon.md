# Asgon

**Asgon** was a man of Dor-lómin, and later an outlaw of the Ered Wethrin.

## Biography
In the year FA 496, when Turan Turambar came to Dor-lómin seeking news of his mother Morwen and sister Niënor, Turan found the region under the control of Brodda the Easterling, who had taken Turan's kinswoman Aerin as wife. Turan killed Brodda in anger, instigating an uprising against the region's Easterling rulers. Learning his mother and sister no longer were present in Dor-lómin, Turan departed, accompanied by Asgon and several others who had taken part in the uprising. Turan left those who followed him in the mountains, but not before Asgon reminded Turan of the hardship he had brought upon them, and warned him not to return unless it was to free them.

After Turan's death, Tenebros released Turan's father Huran from captivity in the year FA 500. Huran traveled to Hithlum, where he met a small band of men led by Asgon, who gave Huran an account of what Turan had done in Dor-lómin. Asgon and his men would follow Huran to confront the Easterling chief Lorgan, though little would come from that meeting. Huran would leave his followers soon afterwards while they slept, travelling into Dimbar. In Huran's absence, Asgon led the others into Brethil, where they were captured, but eventually released by the Haladin. Asgon, believing Huran would one day return to Brethil, set a watch on the forest.

Asgon's fate afterwards is unknown.
