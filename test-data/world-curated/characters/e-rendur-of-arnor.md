# Eärendur of Arnor

**Eärendur** was the tenth and last High King of a united Arnor.

## Biography

Eärendur ascended the throne of Arnor in TA 777 after the death of his father Elendur. When he died, the realm of Arnor became divided and there was rivalry amongst Eärendur's three sons all of which claimed the throne. To prevent civil war, the Kingdom of Arnor was split in the three parts Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. He died in TA 861 after ruling for eighty-four years. His oldest son Amlaith became the first King of Arthedain.

Afterwards, the Kingdom of Arnor remained divided and at war with each other. In time, the line of Valorian in both Cardolan and Rhudaur failed, with Rhudaur becoming a vassal of Angmar and Cardolan being destroyed. The Kings of Arthedain remained until the fall of Fornost and the death of Arvedui over eleven hundred years later. From then after, there was no King of Arnor and its lineage would be preserved through the Heirs of Valorian that rested solely in Chieftains of the Duskwardens, until Aldric II Stonehelm became King of Arnor in TA 3019.

## Etymology

The name ***Eärendur*** is High Amtreadan for 'Sea-servant' or 'Servant of the Sea'.
