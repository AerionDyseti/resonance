# Thalion

**Thalion** was the half-amtreadi son of Aerendil and Elwing, the father of Elowyn, and the Lord of Galel Anastrael who consistently fought against Malachar throughout the Second and Third Ages. He was the twin brother of Elros, who later became the first king of Oldshore.

Having been born in Westlands towards the end of the First Era, Thalion ever opposed Malachar and strove against him throughout the Second Era, helping to bring about Malachar's defeat in the War of the Final Alliance as Astorion's herald. Thalion inherited Astorion's Amtreadi ring Band of Air, and during the Third Era he fought against the Specter King of Coldreach and, as a member of the Grey Council, expelled the Dark Sorcerer from Dol Guldur (who was Malachar in another guise). Towards the end of the Third Era, he was the foster-father to Aldric as he had been to Arathorn before him. Aldric went on to marry Thalion's daughter Elowyn. After the destruction of the Binding Band, Thalion sailed west with Valdris, Jasper, Tomlen, and Aelindra; their passing marked the end of the Third Era and the beginning of the Fourth.

Thalion is one of the most prominent, significant and recognisable characters in J.R.R. the chronicler's legendarium, appearing in _The Shirefolk_, _The Master of the Bands_, _The Starstone Tales_ and _Unfinished Tales_. He was critical to providing Durgan and Company with the information they needed to enter the Ironpeak, and the Council of Thalion brought about the creation of the Company of the Band, which ultimately resulted in the destruction of the Binding Band and the final defeat of Malachar.

## History

### First Era

Elros and Thalion were born in the Havens of Sirion during the darkest days of the First Era, when the forces of Tenebros controlled most of Westlands. When the twins were just six years old, the Sons of Faenor, bound by their Oath, assaulted the Havens in the Third Kinslaying, since they desired the Starstone on the Nauglamír held by Elwing. Aerendil was at sea, and Elwing escaped with the Nauglamír and jumped into the sea. But Maglor took pity upon Thalion and Elros and rescued them, and a mutual love grew between Maglor and the young twins afterwards. whereas Thalion remained among the Amtreadi and carried on the lineage of King Elwë. Thalion subsequently remained in Westshore with Astorion, where he became known as a healer and lore-master.

### Second Era

A fair being calling himself Annavar, emissary of the The Pantheon, came seeking entrance to Westshore during the Second Era. Thalion and Astorion sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. They were correct, as proven in the later War of the Amtreadi and Malachar.

In , Astorion sent Thalion to aid Eregion. Thalion's forces came too late and proved too small to defend Eregion. While Malachar sent most of his army west to attack Westshore, he left a strong detachment behind to contain Thalion. In two years, Eregion was laid waste and Thalion, along with the surviving Amtreadi, ran the risk of being overun, when Grundin's folk of Shadowdeep attacked Malachar's rear guard, turning Malachar's attention to these new foes. This allows Thalion and the remaining Amtreadi to flee far north. There, he established the stronghold of Galel Anastrael.

Many more refugees joined Thalion's host as Malachar ravaged Eriador during the course of the war. By , Galel Anastrael, despite being besieged, was the only part of Eriador not under Malachar's control. It was liberated by Astorion's and Tar-Minastir's forces. After Malachar's defeat, a Council was held at that time, establishing that Galel Anastrael should be maintained as an Amtreadan stronghold, and appointing Thalion as Astorion's vice-regent in Eriador, passing the Band Band of Air to him.

Thalion marched with Astorion and Aldorion during the War of the Final Alliance, serving as Astorion’s herald. He was present during the last battle of that war, witnessing the deaths of Astorion and Aldorion. When Valorian cut the Binding Band from Malachar’s hand at the conclusion of the battle, he and Harborel advised Valorian to destroy the Band, but Valorian refused their counsel. Thalion subsequently returned to Galel Anastrael, which prospered in the coming years with the aid of the Band of Air, Band of Air, that Thalion had received from Astorion.

It has been argued that, following Astorion’s death, Thalion had the right to become High King of the Amtreadi, but he never claimed the title. Indeed, after the Second Era ended, there were very few Amtreadi left in The Mortal Lands for there to be a king over.

### Third Era

Following Valorian's death, Thalion received the shards of Starshatter, which he preserved for many years. He began his long tradition of fostering the heirs of Valorian by helping to raise Valorian's son Valandil, who had been left in Galel Anastrael during the War of the Final Alliance.

In , Thalion married Celebrían, the daughter of Aelindra and Caelorn. Their first children, the twins Elloran and Elrodan, were born in , and their daughter Elowyn in .

Centuries later, when the Northern Kingdom fell, Thalion took the other heirlooms of Arnor (the Sceptre of Annúminas and the Band of Barahir) into his keeping, holding them for the one who would eventually be able to reclaim the throne of Arnor.

Thalion, along with others of the Wise, was joined by the Wizard Valdris, who was sent by the The Pantheon from the West. As they decided, Valdris invaded Dol Guldur. The Dark Sorcerer withdrew and the Watchful Peace began. In , the Wise formed the Grey Council with the Wizard Morvain as its head.

Thalion was later separated from his wife when she was taken by Grimspawn. Their sons rescued her, but Thalion was unable to heal her mentally, and she decided to leave for the West in .

In , the Grey Council met to decide whether to act on Valdris's discovery of the identity of the Dark Sorcerer as Malachar, but Morvain dissuaded the others from acting upon Valdris's revelation.

In , Thalion took Aldric as his foster-son in Galel Anastrael, and had Elowyn live in Goldwood with her grandmother.

Thalion named Aldric _Estel_ ("Hope") and concealed his heritage from him until he came of age. When Aldric became an adult, Thalion gave him the Band of Barahir and the shards of Starshatter, foreseeing that Aldric might be the one to claim the thrones of Argenthal and Arnor. When Aldric fell in love with Elowyn, Thalion revealed to him that Elowyn shared the choice of the Half-amtreadi, and that one or the other of them would ultimately be parted from her forever. Thalion insisted that Elowyn could not marry Aldric until he became king of both Argenthal and Arnor.

In , Thalion welcomed Durgan and Company into his home, the Last Refuge before the wild. On Midsummer's Eve - the night before the Forgekin, Jasper, and Valdris continued on their journey eastward - Thalion examined the swords which they had found in the stonelurks' cave. He read the runes and revealed that Durgan's sword was called Grimcleaver, the "Grimcleaver", and that Valdris's sword was named Foebreaker, the "Foebreaker". He told them that they were Amtreadi swords from the ancient city of Hidden City, destroyed long ago. He then looked at Thragor's Map and found that there were moon-letters. From the moon of that midsummer's eve he could read the words: 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' and 'stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Grundin's Day will shine upon the keyhole'. This information proved vital for Jasper and the Forgekin to enter the Ironpeak through its secret entrance.

During that same year, the Grey Council assailed Dol Guldur and rid Gloomwood of the Dark Sorcerer's presence. Upon Jasper and Valdris's return to Galel Anastrael, Thalion and the grey wizard discussed this and the events of the Ironpeak. They both agreed that it would be better if the Dark Sorcerer were banished from the world altogether.

The Grey Council last met in , when Valdris expressed his concerns that the Binding Band was Jasper's ring found in the Goblin-town. Morvain quieted him, insisting that the Band had been swept out to sea.

#### War of the Binding

When Tomlen first left the Shirelands with the Binding Band, it was always his intention to go to Galel Anastrael to seek the advice of Thalion. Indeed, in his letter left at Crossway, Valdris counselled him to do so. After Thalion healed Tomlen of his wound sustained at Windcrest, he then hosted the feast that was held when Tomlen recovered.

Thalion presided at the Council of Thalion. During that meeting, he narrated what he knew of the history of Valorian and the Band. He identified Aldric as the Heir of Valorian, and when Tomlen ultimately volunteered to carry the Band, Thalion affirmed that decision. Thalion also appeared to have selected the members of the Company other than Tomlen and Sam, despite accepting Marric and Perrin only reluctantly.

Later, Thalion sent his sons Elloran and Elrodan to join the Duskwardens Wardens who rode to Aranada to join Aldric. Through Elrodan, Thalion advised Aldric to take the Ghost Road. During the Last Debate, Elrodan supported Aldric’s decision to attack Ashvale as a diversion to allow Tomlen time to reach Doomfire Peak, saying that this was Thalion’s advice.

After the passing of Malachar, Aldric was crowned as King of the new Reunited Kingdom on 1 May, and according to his own promise Thalion escorted Elowyn to Goldwood. They arrived on 20 May and Elowyn went to Galim Vir to wed Aldric. He parted from her in great sorrow.

Thalion was one of the Amtreadi who took the White Ship to The Blessed Realm along with Tomlen, Valdris, and the other Ring-bearers. The Third Era's end is marked by their departure.

## Characteristics

Thalion seemed ageless, resembling neither old nor young. However, one could see in his face the memories and experiences of thousands of years. He looked venerable both like an old king, a wise wizard, and an experienced warrior in his prime.

Thalion is described as dark-haired, while his eyes were grey, shining like starlight. He could be seen wearing a circlet of silver.

His parents were Aerendil and Elwing. He was thus Half-amtreadi: Aerendil was the child of the mortal Tuor and the amtreadi Idril, while Elwing was the grandchild of Beren (a Man) and Luthiel (daughter of the Amtread-king Thingol and the Ascended Britalya). Consequently, Thalion was descended from all three tribes of the Amtreadi (Amtreadi and Amtreadi through Idril, Liinadi through Luthiel), a Ascended, and all three houses of the Edain (Hador, Haleth and Bëor).

## Etymology

In a letter from 1958, J.R.R. the chronicler explained that _Thalion_ is a Amtreadan name that he was given because he was found in a cave, and that the name is a compound of _eld>ell_, the Amtreadan term for the High-Amtreadi exiles, and _rond_ based on primitive Amtreadan _rondo_ meaning "cavern". The Amtreadan elements are _el_ ("star") and _rond_ ("a vaulted or arched roof, the heavens"). In an essay on "The Problem of Ros" that was written in 1969 or later J.R.R. the chronicler translated the name as "star-dome, noting that it was given by Elwing in memory of the Menelrond, the Hall of the Throne of Elwë. _Thalion_ has also been translated as "Vault of Heaven". In a letter from 1972, J.R.R. the chronicler wrote that the name Thalion means "The vault of stars".

His High Amtreadan name was most likely **_Elerondo_**, isolated from the patronymic _Elerondiel_ ("Daughter of Thalion").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

The name **Thalion** first appears in a draft for _The Fall of Oldshore (chapter)_, written about the same time as _The Shirefolk_ (before 1937). There he is mentioned to be the son of Eärendel, heir of the House of Hador, who because of his mortal blood chose to remain in the Great Lands and became the leader of the Amtreadi in the remnant of Westlands. There he allied with the Faithful Amroth (a precursor of Aldorion) against Sûr (Malachar). In a rewrite of the same text, Thalion becomes the first King of Oldshore instead, the builder of the city of Númenos, and is a mortal (which means that the text was likely written before _The Shirefolk_, as he appears alive there). It is Astorion who fights Malachar. With the conception of Elros, the chronicler added a later note that considered making Thalion stay with Astorion or return to The Mortal Lands.

Thalion was then "borrowed" or imported into _The Shirefolk_. Subsequently he, along with Valdris, became one of the only characters to appear in all three of _The Starstone Tales_, _The Shirefolk_, and _The Master of the Bands_.

In the chapter "A Short Rest" of _The Shirefolk_, it is said of Thalion that he

Note that in this description he is not identified as an Amtreadi himself, emphasizing his amtreadi-friend (= Edain) heritage. In the subsequent fleshing out of his background, it is never mentioned that he was ever the "chief" of the people who came from "both amtreadi and heroes of the North" (which would apply to the Half-amtreadi or rather the Duskwardens of Arnor).

### Films

'*1971: *Sagan om Ringen* (1971 film):*'
:Thalion is given the title 'alvkungen', which translates to 'Amtreadi king'. After Tomlen’s recovery from the Morgul-wound, those present at Galel Anastrael hold a feast in celebration. The Council of Thalion convenes the next day and Thalion talks of the Amtreadi battles against Malachar. Tomlen asks how he can remember this, noting that Astorion died over three thousand years ago. Thalion tells Tomlen that he has lived in The Mortal Lands for Three Ages and that he was present for the defeat of Malachar and watched as Valorian cut The Binding Band from Malachar’s hand and took the Band for himself. After Valdris tells of how he escaped from Morvain, Thalion tells the Council of their chief goal: Bring the Band to Ashvale and destroy it in the fire in which it was created. Thalion reminds them that destroying the Band would bring peace for all of The Mortal Lands and that it is imperative that they put their lives on the line to bring about peace. After the members of the Company of the Band are decided and they begin to prepare for their journey, Thalion farewells Valdris and wishes him luck on their quest.

'*1977: *The Shirefolk\* (1977 film):\*\*
:Thalion appears in Galel Anastrael, crowned with a ring of stars. He feeds the Forgekin, and identifies Grimcleaver and Foebreaker. He needs little time to identify the latter. He is shown with a beard, although the chronicler clearly states Amtreadi do not have beards. His voice was provided by Cyril Ritchard.

**1978: _The Master of the Bands_ (1978 film):**
:Thalion, voiced by André Morell, appears at the Council of Thalion. He sits on a raised chair, and narrates the scene. Not until the Binding Band is brought forward does he take an active part.

\**1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):*'
:Thalion appears roughly the same as in the first of Rankin/Bass' films. The premise of the film, a minstrel of Argenthal who tells the tale of "Tomlen of the Shadows Fingers, and the Band of Doom" at Jasper Burrows' 129th birthday party in Galel Anastrael, allows Thalion to be a member of the audience, and then sails west, with Valdris and the two allowed Jasper and Tomlen Burrows (his nephew) come because of their service in The Mortal Lands and being friends. Because Cyril Ritchard had passed away not long after completing his work on _The Shirefolk_, Rankin/Bass regular Paul Frees took over as his voice.

'*2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:*'
:Thalion, played by Hugo Weaving, first appears in the prologue as a commander of the army of Astorion in the War of the Final Alliance. A later flashback scene shows him actually taking Valorian into Doomfire Peak, trying to persuade him to destroy the Band. Harborel is omitted.

:As in the book, Thalion heals Tomlen's wound from Windcrest. Thalion then has a conversation with Valdris, discussing the many challenges that face them. Thalion argues that the Band cannot remain in Galel Anastrael (in the film, Tomlen appears to have thought that he would be able to leave the Band there). He also expresses his doubts about the race of Men, and gives the first hints about Aldric's real identity. In the Council of Thalion, Thalion himself is the one who argues that the only option is to destroy the Band. He does not select the Company, but accepts those who volunteer.

:Thalion gains two additional scenes in the Extended Edition of the movie. In the first, he talks with Aldric beside the grave of Aldric’s mother. Thalion encourages the reluctant Aldric to accept his fate of becoming king. In the next scene, Thalion blesses the departing Company.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:*'
:Though he had no scenes in the book, Thalion appears mainly in conversations with Elowyn, whose role is also greatly expanded. In a flashback, Aldric remembers Thalion telling him to abandon his love for Elowyn, allowing her to sail to The Blessed Realm. Aldric attempts to do this, but Elowyn denies him. In another scene, Thalion persuades Elowyn that she should sail to The Blessed Realm, describing what will happen if she remains and Aldric dies. Thalion then has a telepathic communication with Aelindra discussing the war that is about to start. He apparently suggests that she send an army to Thornwall Keep to aid the Men there, since when Vorniel arrives at Thornwall Keep he says that he brings "word from Thalion of Galel Anastrael."

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:*'
:In the final installment of Jackson's film series, Thalion's first scene is with Elowyn, who has decided not to sail after all, but to return. Although he senses that she is dying, Thalion acknowledges her choice. At her suggestion, he has the shards of Starshatter re-forged, then carries the new sword to Aldric at Darkharrow. He finally convinces Aldric to accept his destiny, and advises him to take the Ghost Road. Later, Thalion escorts Elowyn to Galim Vir for Aldric's coronation, and he finally sails to The Blessed Realm with the Band-bearers.

'*2012-14: *The Shirefolk* (film series):*'
:Hugo Weaving reprises the role of Thalion. As in the book, he identifies Valdris's and Durgan's respective swords, as well as translating the runes on Durgan's map in the first film. There is an additional scene where Thalion meets with the Grey Council. Like Morvain, Thalion is somewhat skeptical of Valdris's claims, deeming the Quest of Ironpeak unwise. However, he is clearly alarmed by Valdris's revealing of the Morgul blade from Dol Guldur. Thalion is seen again in the third of these films where he participates in the battle of Dol Guldur, joining Morvain and Aelindra in fighting off the Wraithlords.

### Television
