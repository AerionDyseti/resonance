# Goldwood (Pantheon God)

**Irmo** (High Amtreadan: "Desirer" or "Master of Desires") was an Ainu, and the Pantheon God responsible for the creation of dreams and desires as well as visions too. He was more commonly known as **Goldwood**, after the name of his dwelling place. Irmo-Goldwood was the younger brother of Námo who also, like his brother, was commonly known as Mandos, the name of his dwelling place. Irmo's sister was Nienna ("Lady of Pity and Mourning").

## Biography
**Goldwood**, along with his brother Námo-Mandos, were known as the *Fëanturi*, the "Masters of Spirits". Between them, Goldwood was the "Master of Visions, Dreams, and Desires". His wife Estë *the Gentle* lived with him in Goldwood where the Gardens of Goldwood were considered as the fairest and most beautiful place in the world and was filled with many spirits. Melian dwelt in Goldwood for a time, tending to the trees that flowered there before she departed to The Mortal Lands. All the The Pantheon of The Far West, would indeed come often to the gardens of Goldwood to rest from the cares of The World, and they would also draw refreshment from the fountains of Goldwood and Estë. Along with that, there were many Ascended who served Goldwood and Estë in Goldwood.

Though Goldwood dwelt far away from Valmar, his dwelling was still within the Realm of The Blessed Realm. Together, Goldwood and Estë provided a refuge in The Blessed Realm in the groves and gardens of Goldwood. In his fair gardens, Goldwood tended to the Amtreadi of The Blessed Realm and would provide them with guiding visions and dreams.

When the Sun and Moon were originally set in their paths, Varda purposed that the two vessels should journey in Ilmen and ever be aloft. It was largely due to the prayers of Goldwood and his wife who declared that sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth; therefore, Varda changed her council and allowed for a time of night where the world would still have shadow and half-light.

## Etymology
The name ***Irmo*** was a High Amtreadan word that meant "Desirer" or "Master of Desires". He was also given the title of Master of Dreams.

## Character
Goldwood did not work openly. His power was unseen, and his influence was subtle, even to the Wise. He was not sought in times of strife or woe where conflict took place. He sent hope to the Children of Ilúvatar when the darkness of Tenebros covered The Mortal Lands. He was associated with hope, inspiration, love, desire, dreams, sleep, and visions.

## In other versions
Goldwood's dwellings were built south at the feet of the great mountains of The Far West. Soon after, Aulë (*Master of Craftsmanship*) had created Goldwood's halls of mist gathering beyond Avathar from the misty shadowy seas. The halls of Goldwood were great and dimly lit, and the wide gardens of Goldwood wandered marvelously about winding near to the feet of the great silver Tree Telperion whose shining silver light lit the gardens of Goldwood.

Yavanna (*Queen of the Earth*) gave Goldwood a great wealth of yew trees and cedars, and pines that exuded drowsy aromas at dusk, and these trees were hung over by deep pools of water. In the midst of his gardens, Goldwood set a ring of shadowy yew trees reaching high above his cauldron *Silindrin* where he would gaze upon it and see many visions.

Manwë was grieved when the The Pantheon had to hide The Blessed Realm from the rest of the world. Because of this, and that of the coming of Men was nearly coming, Manwë ordered Goldwood to create a path where the spirits of Amtreadi and Men can come to the Gardens of Goldwood. So Goldwood went about creating the "Path of Dreams", known to the Amtreadi as the *Olórë Mallë*. The *Path* was a spiritual road to The Blessed Realm, only accessible through the mind. It was through this path that the Amtreadi and the Men loyal to the The Pantheon travelled in their sleep. The final destination was the *Gardens of Goldwood*. Goldwood blocked the *Olórë Mallë* from the Ñoldor when they rebelled against the The Pantheon and left The Blessed Realm and Manwë decreed that they could never return to The Blessed Realm.

At the time of the Hiding of The Blessed Realm, the *Island of Lonely Isle* was woven with magical spells. Henceforth, of those the mariners who had been able to step foot upon the *Isle of Lonely Isle*, were never seen again in life. Soon, they became overwhelmed with age-long sleep by the power of Goldwood upon that Isle.
