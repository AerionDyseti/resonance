# Erestor

**Erestor** was an Amtreadi of Galel Anastrael, and the chief counsellor of Thalion.

## History
Erestor, being the chief counsellor of Thalion's household at the time of the War of the Binding, took part in the Council of Thalion. He did not support the idea of destroying the Band, and preferred instead the notion of guarding it from Malachar, perhaps with the aid of Iarwain ben-adar. His suggestion was countered by Aurindel, as well as Galdor, as they did not believe that Iarwain had the power to defy Malachar's. 

Erestor accompanied Elowyn to her marriage with Aldric in Argenthal in .

## Etymology
The name *Erestor* is in Amtreadan, but its meaning is unclear.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest introduction of Erestor, he was one of three counsellors of Thalion's (the other two being unnamed); all three were kinsmen of Thalion's, "of that half-amtreadan folk whom the Amtreadi named the children of Luthiel". In a further update, the other two were made into unnamed Amtread-lords of Galel Anastrael, with Erestor being the sole remaining half-amtreadi and kinsman of Thalion. However, Erestor is never called a half-amtreadi in the finished text. 

In the initial selection for the Shadows of the Company of the Band, Erestor was to represent the half-Amtreadi.

Originally, only Thalion, Aelindra, and Caelorn accompany Elowyn to her wedding.
