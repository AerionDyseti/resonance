**Kales Valerian** is a **Human (Aasimar) Paladin** and one of the player characters in the **"Keys to Perfection"** campaign. As a **noble's son who rejected his heritage** to join the **Laborer Caste**, he embodies idealism and social justice.

## Background

**Noble Heritage:**

- Son of a **noble family** within Solaaran society
- Born into **privilege and high social standing**
- Expected to fulfill the **traditional role** of nobility
- Had access to the **best education and opportunities**

**The Great Rejection:**

- **Deliberately rejected his noble birthright** and family expectations
- **Chose to join the Laborer Caste** - the working class of Solaaran society
- Represents a **radical break** with social conventions
- Embodies the principle that **worth is earned, not inherited**

**Aasimar Heritage:**

- **Celestial bloodline** that manifests in divine characteristics
- Natural **connection to divine forces** and good alignment
- **Physical markers** that may set him apart from normal humans
- **Divine calling** that supports his paladin path

## The Paladin's Path

**Divine Dedication:**

- **Paladin** devoted to principles of **justice, protection, and righteousness**
- Likely serves **Vellik** (The Hands of Justice) or **Ahnas/Sol** (The Shining God)
- **Divine powers** that support his quest for social justice
- **Code of honor** that guides his actions

**Social Justice Warrior:**

- Uses his **privileged background** to fight for the **underprivileged**
- Understands **both sides** of Solaaran social hierarchy
- **Bridges the gap** between noble ideals and common reality
- **Champions the workers** while understanding the system

## The Keys to Perfection Campaign

**Campaign Role (810 MR):**

- One of five **party members** investigating conspiracies in **Lux**
- His **moral compass** helps navigate ethical complexities
- **Divine abilities** provide spiritual insight into threats
- **Social connections** from both noble and laborer backgrounds

**Unique Perspective:**

- **Inside knowledge** of Solaaran nobility and politics
- **Working-class experience** from his chosen caste
- **Divine guidance** in distinguishing right from wrong
- **Idealistic vision** of what Solaaran society could become

## Thematic Significance

Kales represents:

- **True nobility** - earned through deed, not birth
- **Social idealism** - the vision of a more just society
- **Divine purpose** - the call to serve something greater
- **Personal sacrifice** - giving up privilege for principle

## Campaign Relevance

In the political thriller setting:

- His **noble connections** provide crucial information
- His **laborer caste** membership offers ground-level perspectives
- His **paladin abilities** help identify supernatural threats
- His **moral clarity** guides the party through ethical dilemmas

## The Rogue Inevitable Threat

Kales's character directly opposes the villain's goals:

- **Free will** - his choice to reject nobility demonstrates personal agency
- **Imperfection** - his struggle with social justice shows growth through conflict
- **Divine purpose** - represents forces the Inevitable cannot "perfect"
- **Moral complexity** - embodies the messy reality of ethical choice

## Campaign History (Sessions 1–10)

### The Case of the Missing Falcon (Sessions 1–2)

Kales participated in the discreet recovery mission for the gyr falcon Iri, navigating Paragon family politics in the Cultivators District.

### The Tainted Water Investigation (Sessions 3–10)

Kales received **adjudicator status** and was officially assigned to work with Shemsu during the desert expedition (Session 4).

**Pivotal Combat Moment (Session 5)**: When the Dark Slayer attacked Sabrina with spectral tendrils and began draining her essence, Kales charged to her defense. His sword struck the creature with an ominous flash—perhaps light, perhaps divine omen—as the blade met empty robes and the Slayer dissolved into shadow. This moment suggested **latent divine properties** in his weapon responding to undead threats.

During the oasis dungeon, Kales struggled through the Dark Slayer's magical darkness (Session 10), at one point colliding with Sid and sending the kobold sprawling. He later reclaimed his sword in what the notes describe as "a really kick-ass maneuver during the heat of battle."

### Items Acquired

- Forgekin Full Plate Armor (masterwork, needs fitting) from ancient miner's remains (Session 5)

### Session 11: The Weight of New Gifts

**Paladin Crisis**: Around the campfire, the party discussed their feelings after the dungeon. When prompted about his newly manifested divine abilities, Kales struggled to articulate his complicated feelings:

"I always was told that I was supposed to help them a certain way, and that always felt really heavy. And so I thought that instead of trying to help them the way I was told to do it, I would try and do it a different way. And now maybe I can do it the way I was told. And it feels like a door opening up after I closed it again."

**Family Pressure**: Kales expressed anxiety about telling his parents—particularly his mother, who has "expectations and a idea and a dream for me. And it's not a bad one. It's just heavy." His father, he indicated, would be easier to talk to. The weight of his mother's expectations clearly burdens him.

**Near Panic Attack**: The emotional weight became too much, and Kales nearly had a panic attack discussing it. He asked the party to change subjects and talk about someone else. Robert played the "scared little kid" angle effectively, showing Kales's vulnerability beneath his paladin exterior.

*Character Note: Kales's arc is crystallizing—he rejected his expected path, found his own way, and now the divine powers he fled from are manifesting anyway. The question isn't whether he has the gift, but what he'll choose to do with it.*

- +1 Quickdraw Wooden Shield bearing Sol's Coalition symbol (Session 10)
