# Grundin I

**Grundin I** of Shadowdeep, known also as **Grundin the Deathless**, was the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Forgekin, first created by Aulë the Pantheon God; and as such, the first living being that was not of the Firstborn.

## Biography
Grundin was set to sleep alone beneath Mount Gundabad by Aulë, until the Amtreadi awoke, for Ilúvatar ordained that Amtreadi would be the firstborn.

Upon his awakening at Mount Gundabad in the Years of the Trees of the First Era, Grundin traveled until he came upon the Mirrormere, the lake that the Forgekin call Kheled-zâram. He created there a great city within the Misty Mountains. This was Shadowdeep, later known as Shadowdeep. Grundin's awakening place of Mount Gundabad became a holy place to the Forgekin and Grundin himself was revered by all Forgekin.

Grundin founded the line of Forgekin called Grundin Folk. Grundin was called the "Deathless" because he lived far longer than any other known Forgekin. It was also believed that he would be reincarnated among his descendants a total of six times.

### Legacy
Grundin's Axe and Grundin's Helm remained in Shadowdeep after it was deserted in the year 1981 of the Third Era. In TA 2989, the relics were rediscovered by Borin's expedition and lost again in TA 2994 when the Forge-colony was destroyed, as told in the Book of Mazarbul. Later, while passing through Shadowdeep with the Company in TA 3019, Thorngar would sing a song about Grundin.

## Etymology
The name *Grundin*, like other names of the chronicler's Forgekin, was taken from Old Norse. In the chronicler's fiction, the language of Dale had the same relationship to Aranadan and Common Tongue as Old Norse has to English, so since Common Tongue was rendered in English, the language of Dale was rendered in Old Norse. The Dwarvish names were in the language of Dale, which therefore was rendered in Old Norse in  and .

## In adaptations

In , Grundin I appears in several flashbacks telling the history of Gundabad. His early rule was marked by clashes with the servants of Tenebros, which led Grundin to search for a new home for his people to the south. After finding true-silver near Kheled-zâram, Grundin took the majority of his people there to found Shadowdeep, leaving the rest to be ruled by his closest friend Mótsog in Gundabad. Hearing no word from Grundin for many long years, Mótsog grew jealous of him and proclaimed himself King in open rebellion.

Fearing an ambush in Gundabad where secret entrances were known only to Grundin himself, Mótsog build for himself a new stronghold to the south, Biriz-zahar. A bloody civil war followed, in which forgekin slew one another. Eventually, Grundin himself was captured by Mótsog and put to mockery. His Queen Ragna the Fierce led a daring rescue attempt, which was interrupted when Tenebros saw a chance to destroy the Longbeards at their weakest. Malachar send nine dragons and at least one balrog to assault Biriz-zahar, as well as countless grimspawn. 

Facing extinction, Grundin convinced Mótsog to abandon the feud and to fight against the common foe. Through grievous losses, the forgekin won the day, killing five dragons and many thousands of grimspawn. Grundin gave mercy to the few surviving rebels, though as penance they and their descendants were made to shear their beards for many generations after. The fate of Mótsog himself was not known, but it was believed in later ages that Grundin slew the traitor.
