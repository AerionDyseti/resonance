## Role/Occupation

Guard Captain of the Frost Queen's Castle, spectral knight bound by oaths to Queen Nilorin

## Description

A figure in full plate armor who steps forth from the ice walls themselves, ethereal frost steaming from his visor. Sylvaris grips a great sword and speaks with a voice that carries in the listener's native tongue through ancient magic. Despite his undead state, he maintains the bearing and honor of an Imitradi warrior.

## Background

Captain Sylvaris served Queen Nilorin in life and was bound by oaths of fealty that persisted even after death. Like all souls in the castle, he was compelled to swear loyalty to the Queen, and these oaths now bind him even in undeath. He represents the Honor Pause tradition at the castle's entrance, offering visitors the choice of Talk, Oath, or Steel.

When the Dragonmarked party chose parlay and shared news from the outside world—including the revelation that the gods had been sealed away beyond the veil—Sylvaris was shaken. If the Starfather could not be reached, then Queen Nilorin could not possibly be receiving divine commands as she claimed. This realization shifted something in him; though still bound by his oaths, he began bending them where he could to aid the heroes.

## The Nature of the Binding

**Important:** Not all of the undead willingly serve the Queen. While some are true believers in her heretical faith, many—including potentially Sylvaris—are bound by oaths and promises they cannot break past death. The soul-pacts in the Reliquary of Names are what truly bind them.

## Nilorin's Heresy

Queen Nilorin believes she is following the will of the Starfather, and that everything she does (binding the Amtreadi into eternal undead servitude) is to further the power and reach of the Starfather's chosen people. She sees undeath as "holy ascension"—eternal service to the divine. The "Marching of the Phalanxes" is not just a control spell; it is a perverted hymn.

## Goals/Motivations

- Fulfill his oaths while honoring his true sense of justice
- Learn the truth about the Queen's claimed divine mandate
- Potentially find release from his binding

## Relationships

- **Queen Nilorin** — Liege; bound by oaths of fealty that persist in death
- **The Dragonmarked** — Granted safe passage after parlay; provided intelligence about the phalanxes
- **The Imitradi** — His people, the mountain amtreadi who value precision over assumption

## Key Information Shared

- The Chime's protection is maintained by four phalanxes
- The marching rhythm sustains the Queen's phylactery—stop the marching, weaken her defenses
- The sound conduits channel both the march and the Chime's power throughout the realm
- Suggested seeking out the Ataniisti, an amtreadi faction with deeper knowledge of divine matters

## Notes

- Gave the party a parlay token
- One of five binding scrolls (the purple one) is linked specifically to Sylvaris
- His binding scroll could potentially be used to free him from his oaths
