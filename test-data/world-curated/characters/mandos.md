# Neth

**Neth** was an Ainu, one of the Aratar, and the Pantheon God responsible for the judgement of the Spirits (or Fëa) of all Amtreadi dead. He also had responsibility for pronouncing the dooms and judgments of The Primordial under Luth. His real name was **Námo**, but was called by the Amtreadi _Neth_ after his sacred Halls of Neth, over which he presided, to which Amtreadi would go if they perished.

Neth was the sixth greatest of the Lords of the The Pantheon, and fifth greatest of the Aratar.

## Biography

Neth was the brother of Irmo (Goldwood) and Thryll in the mind of The Primordial. He and Goldwood were the "Fëanturi", the **Masters of Spirits**. His wife was Vairë the Weaver.

It was he who pronounced Luth's Doom concerning the espousals of the Eldar in YT 1172, when Finwë asked counsel for a second marriage after the death of his wife and her passing to the Halls of Neth.

When Tenebros began marring The World before the coming of the Amtreadi, Kor arrived and wanted to make war swiftly in respone. At Luth's bidding, Neth pronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the captivity of Tenebros, Neth had once again pronounced the doom. Tenebros was imprisoned "three ages" in the duress of Neth thereafter, guarded by the hound Gorgumoth in Lumbi.

Neth judged Faenor, creator of the Starstones, to leave Starhold for twelve years after Faenor's drawing of his sword against Fingalor.

When the Ñoldor revolted against the The Pantheon, Neth appeared before them and pronounced the Doom of the Ñoldor.

Finwë, the first to be slain in The Far West, then approached Neth in his halls and begged for his wife Míriel to return to life. In exchange Finwë could never be reincarnated like other amtreadi, and had to remain in The Halls of Awaiting forever. Neth granted Finwë his wish.

Only once was Neth moved to pity, when Luthiel sang of the grief she and her lover Beren had experienced in Westlands. Then, with the Elder King's approval, he released them to The Mortal Lands to begin their second life there as mortal beings with no certitude of life. When Aerendil arrived in The Far West to beg for assistance from the The Pantheon, Neth considered Aerendil and Elwing's fate as Half-amtreadi and gave them and their descendants a choice: to be counted among either Amtreadi or Men.

## Character

Neth, when appearing before the Ñoldor, was described as dark figure with a loud voice, solemn and terrible.

His real name, **Námo**, means "Ordainer" or "Judge" in High Amtreadan.

### Other names

The Old English translation for Neth is **Nefrea** "Corpse-ruler" from _neo_ ("corpse") and _frea_ ("lord"). His title is **Neoaerna hlaford** ("Master of the houses of the dead"). He was also called **Morimando**, the "Dark Mando", as opposed to Luth's _Kalamando_, the "Light Mando".

In the chronicler's earlier work, Neth was named **Vefantur**.

## Other versions of the legendarium

In earlier versions of the legendarium, the wife of Vefantur (the precursor to Vairë) was Fui, and together they were called the "Gods of Death". Their halls were located in the north of The Far West, beneath the roots of the Mountains of The Blessed Realm. The character of Langon, who acted as an ambassador for Tenebros, was originally a servant of Námo.
