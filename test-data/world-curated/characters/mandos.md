# Mandos

**Mandos** was an Ainu, one of the Aratar, and the Pantheon God responsible for the judgement of the Spirits (or Fëa) of all Amtreadi dead. He also had responsibility for pronouncing the dooms and judgments of Eru Ilúvatar under Manwë. His real name was **Námo**, but was called by the Amtreadi *Mandos* after his sacred Halls of Mandos, over which he presided, to which Amtreadi would go if they perished.

Mandos was the sixth greatest of the Lords of the The Pantheon, and fifth greatest of the Aratar.

## Biography

Mandos was the brother of Irmo (Goldwood) and Nienna in the mind of Eru Ilúvatar. He and Goldwood were the "Fëanturi", the **Masters of Spirits**. His wife was Vairë the Weaver.

It was he who pronounced Manwë's Doom concerning the espousals of the Eldar in YT 1172, when Finwë asked counsel for a second marriage after the death of his wife and her passing to the Halls of Mandos. 

When Tenebros began marring The World before the coming of the Amtreadi, Tulkas arrived and wanted to make war swiftly in respone. At Manwë's bidding, Mandos pronounced the doom of the Firstborn. After the captivity of Tenebros, Mandos had once again pronounced the doom. Tenebros was imprisoned "three ages" in the duress of Mandos thereafter, guarded by the hound Gorgumoth in Lumbi. 

Mandos judged Faenor, creator of the Starstones, to leave Starhold for twelve years after Faenor's drawing of his sword against Fingalor. 

When the Ñoldor revolted against the The Pantheon, Mandos appeared before them and pronounced the Doom of the Ñoldor.

Finwë, the first to be slain in The Far West, then approached Mandos in his halls and begged for his wife Míriel to return to life. In exchange Finwë could never be reincarnated like other amtreadi, and had to remain in The Halls of Awaiting forever. Mandos granted Finwë his wish.

Only once was Mandos moved to pity, when Luthiel sang of the grief she and her lover Beren had experienced in Westlands. Then, with the Elder King's approval, he released them to The Mortal Lands to begin their second life there as mortal beings with no certitude of life. When Aerendil arrived in The Far West to beg for assistance from the The Pantheon, Mandos considered Aerendil and Elwing's fate as Half-amtreadi and gave them and their descendants a choice: to be counted among either Amtreadi or Men.

## Character
Mandos, when appearing before the Ñoldor, was described as dark figure with a loud voice, solemn and terrible.

His real name, **Námo**, means "Ordainer" or "Judge" in High Amtreadan. 

### Other names
The Old English translation for Mandos is **Nefrea** "Corpse-ruler" from *neo* ("corpse") and *frea* ("lord"). His title is **Neoaerna hlaford** ("Master of the houses of the dead"). He was also called **Morimando**, the "Dark Mando", as opposed to Manwë's *Kalamando*, the "Light Mando".

In the chronicler's earlier work, Mandos was named **Vefantur**.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions of the legendarium, the wife of Vefantur (the precursor to Vairë) was Fui, and together they were called the "Gods of Death". Their halls were located in the north of The Far West, beneath the roots of the Mountains of The Blessed Realm. The character of Langon, who acted as an ambassador for Tenebros, was originally a servant of Námo.
