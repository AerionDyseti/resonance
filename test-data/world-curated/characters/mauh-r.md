# Mauhúr

**Mauhúr** was an Ironspawn of Ironspire in the late Third Era, during the War of the Binding.

## Biography

Mauhúr was sent to reinforce Uglúk and Morvain's scouts as they returned to Ironspire with Marric and Perrin, after the battle at Hill of Sight and death of Valdric. He found them surrounded by Éomer's Aranadan *éored* at the edge of Deeproot Forest, from which he led his Ironspawn in an attack. However, despite Mauhúr's reinforcements, the Aranadan were able to defeat the Grimspawn, killing some and driving away others. It is untold whether Mauhúr was among those killed or those driven away.

## In adaptations

### Ralph Bakshi's *The Master of the Bands*

In Ralph Bakshi's animated film *The Master of the Bands*, Mauhúr is one of two Grimspawn that guard the Shirefolk.

### Peter Jackson's *The Two Towers*

In the Peter Jackson film *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*, where he was portrayed by Robbie Magasiva, Mauhúr was an Ironspawn captain in the company that was sent to accompany Uglúk and the rest of Morvain's scouts as they returned with Marric and Perrin. He smelled the presence of Aldric, prompting the Ironspawn group to travel faster.

During a night rest, Mauhúr complained about having no food except maggoty bread, which led to skirmish between Ironspawn and Grimspawn who wanted to eat the Shirefolk. Suddenly they were surrounded by a group of Aranadan, led by Éomer, who killed all the Grimspawn including Mauhúr.

### Video games

In , Mauhúr leads a group of Ironspawn that split off from Uglúk's band and establish a camp Kufuzg in the Norcrofts of Aranada, where he is found and killed by the player.
