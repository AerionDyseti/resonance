# Aegnor

**Aegnor** was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi, the third son of Finarfin, elder brother of Aelindra, younger brother of Finoran Felagund and Angrod and lord of the Ñoldor of Dorthonion in the First Era.

## Biography

Aegnor was born in Starhold sometime during the Noontide of The Blessed Realm. When Faenor spoke in Starhold, Aegnor was moved by his words as was his brother but neither spoke against their father; however, he and his brothers followed the host of the Ñoldor to The Mortal Lands. When the Ñoldor returned to The Mortal Lands, he together with Angrod held the northern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Tenebros throughout the time of the Siege of Iron Fortress.

Aegnor never married but he was in love with the Bëorian wise-woman Andreth, and she returned his feelings. They spent much time discussing Men and Amtreadi and their fates in the world, which are fully explained in the *Athrabeth Finoran ah Andreth*. However, it was wartime and he did not make his intentions towards her clear enough. He was killed along with his brother soon after when Tenebros broke the Siege at the start of Battle of Sudden Flame in FA 455.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the early versions of the chronicler's legendarium (see ), a character named ***Egnor*** appears. In some of the earliest stories (see: ), this was the name of the father of Beren (who then was a Ñoldorin amtreadi, not a man as in later writings). It is far from certain if this Egnor was the same character.

## Trivia
