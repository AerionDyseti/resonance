**Míriel Therindë** [High Amtreadan: ***Þerindë***] or ***Míriel Serindë*** was the first wife of Finwë, High King of the Ñoldor, and mother of Faenor. Miriel's hair was described as being silver in appearance, an unusual color for one of the Ñoldor.

## Biography
left|thumb|200px|Finwe near his wife Miriel Serinde, by Steamey.

Míriel married Finwë sometime during the Noontide of The Blessed Realm and they lived in Starhold. In YT 1169,

After Finwë had been killed, Míriel was granted permission to return to life, where she entered the service of Vairë, her task to weave all the deeds of the House of Finwë in the Tapestry of Time.

## Etymology
***Míriel*** means "Jewel-woman" or perhaps "Jewel-daughter", and her amilessë **Þerindë** "Broideress". ***Serindë*** is a later version of her name after changes in the language of the Amtreadi. However, she requested that her kin continue to call her Þerindë (Þ is pronounced "th" so therindë ).

## Character
Míriel was described to have silver hair and a slender figure. Her customary singing while working was described as "soft and sweet".
