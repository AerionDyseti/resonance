# Harry Goatleaf

**Harry Goatleaf** was a Man of Crossway and a member of the Goatleaf Family.

## History

Harry Goatleaf worked as a Gate-keeper stationed at the western gate in the great hedge that surrounded the township of Crossway. On 23 September, Wanderer observed the Wraithlords having a conversation with Goatleaf before leaving him white and shaking. When Tomlen Burrows and his companions arrived at the town, he got a lantern and questioned them gruffly about their intentions, silently observing that they came from the Shirelands before letting them in. Before wishing them good night, he warned them that there would be more folk besides him at _The Wanderer's Rest_ who would ask them questions.

Before the end of , the Men of Crossway kicked the Ruffians among the Southerners out of Crossway. Early in the New Year however, the town was attacked in the night by the very same Ruffians. During the battle, Goatleaf fought on the side of the Ruffians along with Bill Ferny. After the battle, Goatleaf left Crossway alongside the other Ruffians, hiding out in either the Chetwood beyond Archet, or in the wilds north of Crossway. Later, it was believed by Barliman Butterbur that Goatleaf and Ferny were the ones who let the Ruffians in on the night of the battle. Goatleaf's position as a Gate-keeper was presumably later taken by another Gate-keeper.

## Other versions of the legendarium

In an early draft, Harry Goatleaf whispered with Bill Ferney and the squint-eyed southerner in a corner of the Wanderer's Rest and slipped out behind them after Tomlen's song. He is described later on in the draft as "_a mean old curmudgeon_". In another draft, Valdris is at the gate and asks Goatleaf if he had seen any Shirelands-shirefolk. Goatleaf revealed that he did not as he was in Staddle and his brother, Ned, was at the gate in his place. After advising Valdris to head to the inn, he shut the gate. Later in this draft, the Shadow Riders came to the gate and Harry revealed Valdris's entry. A few moments later, when Tomlen passed through, he was more friendly than in the published text, and the dialogue was slightly expanded.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2001: *Pán prsteňov\* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):\*\*
:Harry Goatleaf makes a brief appearance early in the second episode of the radio series. He is portrayed by an uncredited actor (making him the only notable character in the entire series to go uncredited).

**2001: _The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band_**:
:Harry Goatleaf (portrayed by Martyn Sanderson) is never named, but is referred to as the \*_Gate Keeper_' in the end credits. Unlike the novel, he doesn't seem to be in league with the Shadow Riders. In fact, he is killed when the Shadow Riders knock the gate down and crush him underneath it as they storm Crossway.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band (video game)''''':
:Harry Goatleaf is first encountered as one of the patrons in the Wanderer's Rest Inn, where he warns Tomlen that suspicious folk have been seen in Crossway, and seemingly shows concern for Tomlen's safety and well-being. He is later seen in a cutscene opening the town's gates and letting wolves loose into the streets. After this, he is never seen again. He is voiced by an uncredited Tom Kane.

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Harry Goatleaf is found at the west gate of Crossway, and for a long time he was not involved in any quests. He later appeared alongside Bill Ferny as one of Lotho Sackwell-Burrows' enforcers in the Shirelands and participated in the attack on the Wanderer's Rest during the winter of 3019.
