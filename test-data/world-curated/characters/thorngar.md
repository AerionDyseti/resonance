# Thorngar

**Thorngar** was a forgekin of the House of Grundin who became famous as the only Forgekin member of the Company of the Band.

## History

Thorngar was born in the Blue Mountains during a time of exile for the Grundin Folk, about a century after the tragic destruction of Dale and the Sacking of Ironpeak by Scorath the Golden. His father was Glorin, a direct descendant of King Náin II and, through him, of Grundin the Deathless. His father joined Durgan and Company in their quest to reclaim the Kingdom under the Mountain, but Thorngar was forbidden because he was too young: only 62 at the time.

The Forgekin were successful in their Quest and Thorngar and his father were among the Forgekin who returned to Ironpeak. Years later, in , Thorngar witnessed the arrival of a messenger of Malachar (possibly a Wraithlords) inquiring about Jasper Burrows, old acquaintance of his father, and the Band of Binding, promising tempting offers. Thorngar accompanied his troubled father to Galel Anastrael for the dual purpose of warning Jasper and seeking the counsel of Thalion on such weighty matters. He attended the Council of Thalion as a representative of the Forgekin of Ironpeak.

### The Company of the Band

Thorngar, as the only young forgekin seen at the council of Thalion, was appointed as a member of the Company of the Band. He alone of the company wore a mail-shirt, and carried a broad-bladed axe. He quickly distinguished himself in the company by declaring that he "[needed] no map" and naming the Misty Mountains individually by their Forgespeech names, inspiring the comment from Sam: "A fair jaw-cracker forgekin-language must be!"

Thorngar stood more than all the others with Valdris on the matter of passing through Shadowdeep. This may be influenced by his curiosity about the fate of his cousin Borin, who went thither to refound the ancient kingdom of the Longbeards, and also his vengeful nature. His first clash with Sylvorn occurred before the Doors of Grundin, in a brief dispute over whose fault it was (the Amtreadi’ or the Forgekin’) that the friendship between the two races waned. Valdris quickly intervened, though it was not until Goldwood that they would truly become friends.

He was quite helpful to Valdris in explaining the Doors to the other curious members of the fellowship. Valdris showed his appreciation of Thorngar’s skills by letting him walk up front through the dark tunnels beside himself, and taking brief counsels with him when the way was unsure. It is probable that here Valdris was tapping into Forgekin inborn or developed skills rather than actual knowledge of Shadowdeep itself, as Thorngar had never personally been there.

Thorngar reacted most indignantly to Sam’s suggestion that Shadowdeep was but "holes", going so far as to chant for him an ancient song. Thorngar continued to be helpful to Valdris on the rest of the dark passage, and boldly aided in the Battle of the Chamber of Records, protecting Borin’s tomb. After Valdris remained behind to halt the Flamefiend, Thorngar led the others across the Bridge of Shadowdeep.

He again showed great emotion when they neared Kheled-zâram, taking Tomlen alone out of all the company with him to see it (though Sam followed as well). This hinted at a degree of affection for Tomlen, though it may merely have been because he was the most important of the company. Despite his helpfulness, at Goldwood he became the greatest hindrance to the Company, when he alone was required to be blindfolded and of all of them liked the idea the least (save for perhaps Sylvorn). The compromise was made that the entire company would go through the Goldwood in this manner, that Thorngar would not suffer alone. In return he attempted to compliment her, as he saw her love and understanding. Though slightly clumsy in his first attempt, he distinguished himself when, as Aelindra gave the Company gifts, he asked only for a single strand of her hair. Aelindra gave him three hairs with a blessing, probably remembering when Faenor had requested a similar gift several millennia ago. She later referred to him as "Lockbearer". Thorngar wept openly at the departure from Goldwood, calling the light more dangerous than the darkness he had feared.

By the time the Company departed from Goldwood, Thorngar had become fast friends with Sylvorn the Amtreadi, a result of Aelindra’s kindness. This, too, made him famous among all the Forgekin of the Third Era.

### The Three Hunters

After the Breaking of the Company, during which he and Sylvorn slew many grimspawn, Thorngar listened in silence as his only remaining comrades, Aldric and Sylvorn, sang a lament for Valdric in the character of three of the Winds. Only the East Wind was left, and Thorngar would not sing it, which Aldric declared to be appropriate.

For most of the chase he served as a commentator, usually leaving the decisions to Aldric. His reaction was quite hostile to the suspicious Aranadan, especially after Horsehelm's rash comments about Aelindra. Little did either know that they would become close friends in the times to come as fiery words passed between them. After the Three Hunters were lent horses, Thorngar and Horsehelm parted in peace, with promises to one another of reconciliation.

Of the Three Hunters, Thorngar seemed the most shaken by Deeproot Forest while they searched for traces of Marric and Perrin. Thorngar felt no reluctance to shoot the “unarmed” old man whom they thought was Morvain, unlike Aldric and Sylvorn. After Valdris was revealed to them, Thorngar fell to his knees. Valdris put his hand on Thorngar’s head, and the forgekin laughed for the first time recorded during the Quest of the Band.

Thorngar was delighted by the White Mountains and Thornwall Keep, declaring "This country has tough bones". He declared that if he had a hundred of his kin he could make the fortress invincible.

### War of the Binding

During the Battle of the Thornwall, Thorngar saved Horsehelm’s life outside the gates. He came in, boasting of his first two grimspawn-kills to his friend Sylvorn. Sylvorn estimated his slaughter to amount to twenty, starting the good-hearted grimspawn-killing game that continued through the rest of the battle. Thorngar was among the first to the culvert when the grimspawn crept through, leaping heroically into their midst from the walls. He then proceeded to lead the blocking up of the culvert. During the course of the battle, Thorngar was one of those forced into the Glittering Caves. He was astonished to see the magnificence of these caverns, moving even Sylvorn with his glowing description of them. This one sight would change his life.

His final kill score number was forty-two in that battle, surpassing his friend the amtreadi by one. Thorngar shows a hint of humour and affection when he greets the two Shirefolk Marric and Perrin comfortably situated among flotsam and jetsam in the ruin of Ironspire. He declared himself deep in Perrin’s debt when the shirefolk lent him his spare pipe.

Thorngar shows some of the stone hardness of Forgekin when they meet Morvain at The Black Tower. Morvain uses the power in his voice to sway Theron to forgive him and make peace, and many of the Aranadan are moved by his magic and are spell-bound. Unmoved, Thorngar comments that Morvain's words cannot be trusted and that from The Black Tower, help would mean ruin. Morvain is angered enough by Thorngar that for a moment he loses his charm.

As the fellowship of friends again began to break up – Valdris and Perrin heading for Galim Vir, Theron and his riders for Darkharrow – Thorngar out of love and respect for Aldric went with him, Sylvorn, the sons of Thalion, and the Duskwardens Wardens on the Ghost Road. He showed great reluctance before the Dark Door, the final thought that drove him downward was the thought of being bested by an Amtreadi underground.

He participated in the epic Battle of Galim Vir Fields, returning with Aldric and his other companions on the ships of the Corsairs of Umbar, and later recounted their journey to the fascinated Shirefolk. He began to fear for Sylvorn, who seemed entranced by the Sea. His position on Amtreadi completely changed, he remarked "If all the fair folk take to the Havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay". He was much more sceptical as to the overall end of Men than his comrade.

Thorngar fought in the Battle of the Obsidian Gate, passing through unscathed, and finding the alive but bruised Perrin among the dead lying on the hill. He returned to the Field of Cormallen to be reunited with his friends, and there displayed open affection for all of them, even Perrin ("If only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never forget").

### After the War of the Binding

After the coronation of Aldric, Thorngar said farewell to his old friend Horsehelm, who begged for pardon as to his words on Aelindra, though he added that he still didn’t think she was the fairest in the world. When he added that he considered Elowyn the fairest instead, Thorngar was content with this.

During the return journey he visited many places with Sylvorn, including Deeproot Forest and Aglarond. Eventually he returned to Ironpeak, to find it nearly devastated by war. Dagor II Ironfoot had died, and Durgan III Stonehelm was now King. Eventually, though, he returned to the Glittering Caves with a contingent of forgekin, becoming the "Lord of the Glittering Caves". He rebuilt the gates of Galim Vir with _truesilver_ and steel, and in both Argenthal and Aranada accomplished great works. There he met his friends Marric and Perrin and the history of his people made its way to the Red Book; he also set out the genealogical tree of the Forgekin of Ironpeak for King Stonehelm.

## Etymology

In 1978, Jim Allan noted that the name _Thorngar_ appears once in the _Völuspá_ and three times in the _Prose Edda_. Allan suggested that _Thorngar_ means "One-of-Gimlé" or "One-of-Gimill", where _Gimlé_/_Gimill_ in the _Eddas_ is a hall of the after-life "_inhabited solely by Light-amtreadi_" (evoking Thorngar's leaving for The Far West). He also noted that the nominative form _Gimlé_ of the dative form _Thorngar_ consists of the elements _gim_ ("fire") and _hlé_ ("shelter", "lee").

J.R.R. the chronicler wrote in a draft letter after he had been questioned about the name _Thorngar_ that the poetic archaic Old Norse word _gim_ seems to have meant "fire".

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

The name "Thorngar" was first used by the chronicler for the name of a Gnome in the _Tale of Tinúviel_, written in mid-1910s.

In the Adûnaic language described in _The Notion Club Papers_ (1945), _gimli_ (pl. _gimil_) is the word for "star", derived from a root G-M-L and having the Characteristic Vowel I. From these derive others words such as _igmil_ "a star-shaped formation"; and _Gimilnitîr_ "Star-kindler" (Gilthoniel), a name for Gendei.
