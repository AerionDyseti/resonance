# Morvain

**Morvain**, also known as **Morvain the White**, was the first of the Greycloaks (Wizards), the emissaries of the The Pantheon sent to The Mortal Lands in the Third Era to help the Free Peoples of the World to counter the possible return of Malachar. He was originally the chief and greatest of the Five Greycloaks, as well as the head of the Grey Council that for a time opposed the re-emergence of the Shadow Lord. For many years he was regarded as an ally of Argenthal and Aranada, and was even granted guardianship of the tower of The Black Tower as part of the defense of the West.

However, after studying the works of Malachar, particularly the lore of the Bands of Binding, Morvain, overcome by pride and greed, betrayed his allies and swore fealty to Malachar, becoming one of his greatest servants. The Wizard, however, plotted to betray his "new master" as well and usurp his place as ruler of The Mortal Lands by claiming the Binding Band for himself, or at least to become his right hand. In the War of the Binding, Morvain marshalled an army at Ironspire to both conquer Aranada at Malachar's behest and try to claim the Binding Band for himself.

After his master's downfall and his own failure to obtain the Band or subjugate Aranada, Morvain journeyed to the Shirelands, where a host of Ruffians had already seized control of it through Lotho Sackwell-Burrows, until Shirefolk revolted and liberated the land, and exiled him. He was then slain by Verin Snakewhisper, his servant whom he had long abused. Following the death of Morvain's physical body, his spirit was rejected by the The Pantheon due to his treachery.

## Biography

### Origin

Morvain was originally a powerful Ascended of Kang-Somer the Smith named _Curumo_ (later in Amtreadan, _Curanir_). From the beginning, he was much like Malachar,

Curumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, Valorin, (later known as "Valdris") was commanded by Luth to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to be jealous of Valorin, due to Gendei's decision to send Valorin not as the third Istar, but as the second. He also was charged to take Aiwendil (later called "Thornwick") to please Bes, which Curumo did not wish to do, and this led to contempt for the latter Wizard. The others who were chosen were Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Greycloaks). Curumo then was appointed overall leader of the group. Only the keeper of the havens, Harborel the Shipwright, knew Curumo's nature and purpose. Curumo would later discover that Harborel had given Band of Fire, the Red Ring, to Valorin upon their first landing in The Mortal Lands. Even though Curumo was recognized as the head of the order while Valorin was not, Harborel had divined Valorin as the wisest and greatest of the Greycloaks. Curumo's jealousy of Valorin grew from these events, perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of the Wizards.

To the Amtreadi, Curumo became known as _Curanir_, whereas Men called him Morvain, the name by which he was afterwards remembered. The White Messenger and the two Blue Greycloaks went into the east of The Mortal Lands and their fate after this was unknown. After one and a half millennia, Morvain returned to the west, just as Malachar's power was growing again at Dol Guldur in Gloomwood.

#### The Grey Council

When the Grey Council was formed around the year 2463 of the Third Era to counter Malachar, Morvain was appointed its leader, though Aelindra wanted Valdris in this position. Although Valdris had declined leadership, Morvain continued to resent the Grey Wanderer. He also had an intense dislike for Thornwick, whom he dismissed as a fool.

At this point Morvain had begun to sense the resurgence of Malachar. This was also the same year that Malachar's Binding Band was taken by the Stoor Slivven (later called Creepkin), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds of years. The White Wizard then began to study the lore of the Bands of Binding. However, his extensive research on the Rings eventually led him to admire the Shadow Lord, which then caused him to fall into the folly of imitating him. Morvain believed he could be the ruler of The Mortal Lands, in Malachar's likeness, and "have his own will by force". As he had hoped, Morvain also found one of the remaining seeing-stones in The Black Tower, but deceptively concealed his discovery from the rest of the Grey Council.

In TA 2850, Valdris entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil presence within was indeed Malachar. He then advised the Grey Council that they should attack Malachar. However, Morvain advised against this by deceitfully claiming that the Binding Band would never be found. With almost the entire Council deceived, they did not attack. However, the Grey Wanderer would later remark that it was at this meeting that he first began to suspect that the White Wizard desired to attain the Binding Band. Morvain's real intention was to allow Malachar to build up his strength, so that the Band would reveal itself and he could claim it first, so he was willing to let Malachar be for the time being.

Concealing his contempt, Morvain deceitfully persuaded Thornwick to teach him how to tame birds and beasts; these he used as spies for his own purposes, unbeknownst to the Brown Wizard. He later found that the Shadow had more knowledge of the possible location of the Binding Band than he expected. Therefore, in TA 2941, Morvain finally agreed to an assault upon Dol Guldur. The attack was successful, and by the devices of the White Wizard, the Shadow Lord was driven from the fortress.

At the last meeting of the Grey Council in TA 2953, Morvain lied to the Council about the Band being "passed down Greatwater to the Sea". He then ceased all cooperation with the Wise, taking Ironspire for his own and fortifying it. Surrounding himself with "all who hated Argenthal and Aranada" (i.e. Northern Grimspawn from the Misty Mountains, Dunlendings and other evil things), Morvain troubled the borders of the Aranadan during the reign of Thengel and began building his own army. Around TA 2990, Morvain started the "special breeding" of Grimspawn at Ironspire and, as Tenebros and Malachar had done before him, crossbred Grimspawn with Men to make Half-grimspawn, But Morvain was, in truth, a faithless vassal, who coveted the Band for himself. The fallen Wizard's endgame was to usurp his "new master"

Working under orders from Ashvale and also eager to expand his own dominion, the Wizard plotted to "deliver" Aranada to his "dark master". trees were cut down and replaced by caverns filled with forges, furnaces and other machines. Around TA 3000, Morvain sent many of his Ironspawn to join the Northern Grimspawn and the Ashvale-grimspawn in raiding the eastern villages of Aranada. To further weaken the kingdom, Morvain bought Verin Snakewhisper, Theron's counselor, with the promise of Shieldwyn's hand by TA 3014 and used him as a mole in the royal court to sap the king's strength with deceitful advice and poisons. Suspecting a potential connection between the Band and the Shirelands (based mostly on Valdris's interest there), Morvain instructed his agents to infiltrate the Shirelands and keep tabs on the comings and goings of any important Shirefolk. His dealings with Pipe-weed had also earned him allies among the Sackwell-Burrows and Bracegirdle families, who owned many plantations. Morvain also used his agents in Eriador to keep watch on the Duskwardens protecting the Shirelands, as well as to mislead Malachar's more trustworthy informants. before sending him as captive to Malachar in Ashvale;

Commanded by Malachar, Morvain moved against Theron to keep Aranada from riding to Argenthal's aid. With Verin preventing any military mobilization within the kingdom, Morvain sent large raiding forces to wreak havoc in the Westmark of Aranada. The only true obstacles to his invasion were Theron's son and nephew, Theodric and Horsehelm respectively. As Snakewhisper had failed to turn the two men against each other, the White Wizard tasked his servants to slay the king's heir at all costs. Per this special order, the warriors of Ironspire engaged the defenders of Aranada at the Fords of Iron; the First Battle at the Fords of Iron ended in the death of Theodric followed by the retreat of Morvain's hordes. At the same time, the Wizard also betrayed his master: he sent trusted warbands to hunt down the Company and capture the Band-bearer. Morvain's scouts, led by Uglúk, ambushed the company at Hill of Sight, where they took Perrin and Marric captive, while also shooting Valdric "with many black-feathered arrows" when he tried to defend the Shirefolk. Slowed on their way back to Ironspire by conflict with Ashvale-grimspawn loyal to Malachar, the Isengarders were slain on the eaves of Deeproot by Aranadan led by Horsehelm. Thorngar believed he had glimpsed Morvain at the site of the skirmish, presumably having hastened to claim the Band from the Shirefolk.

The Wizard's position was becoming dangerously isolated: he lacked the Band, his neighbors he had "made [his] enemies" and he had also "cheated [his] new master". Believing he might yet claim lordship over Aranada and regain Malachar's favor by delivering the Aranadan to him,

Valdris, who had returned from death to accomplish the mission Morvain did not, expelled the turncoat from the ranks of the Greycloaks and the Grey Council and broke his staff. Morvain also lost the _seeing-stone_ of The Black Tower when Verin threw it off a balcony, undecided about which he hated more, Morvain or Valdris, and hitting neither. Even so, Valdris muses that Morvain will prove a faithless servant and that Malachar is already aware of that. In addition, his intention to usurp his new master (mentioned in movie tie-ins like and Wētā Workshop merchandise) is only implied in the trilogy itself. However, a deleted scene had Morvain propose to Valdris that, if they could wield the Band's power, they could betray Malachar and "command The Mortal Lands" Sir Christopher Lee also pointed out that although "Morvain becomes Malachar’s servant", he still plots to supplant him as Master of the Binding. While Morvain's interactions with Valdris are toned down in the theatrical cut, the extended edition emphasizes Morvain's grudge against Valdris, alluding to similar passages from and .

Unlike in the source material, the title of "Morvain of Many Colours" is omitted, and he is referred to only as "Morvain the White". Instead of being "woven of all colours", the robes were made cream white to suggest that, even after his defection to the service of the Shadow Lord, the Wizard considers himself unfallen. Morvain's staff of power is shown as a talisman of his authority, resembling The Black Tower, with a white crystal set between the four spires.

#### Background

Morvain was originally the chief and greatest of Greycloaks, sent to aid the Free Peoples make their stand against Malachar. The White Wizard "could exert much control over men's minds" through his voice and his skill earned him the Amtreadi name _Curanir_. His researches into the lore of The Mortal Lands, especially Malachar's works, led him to believe that he could be the ruler of The Mortal Lands in the likeness of Malachar. He settled in The Black Tower at Ironspire, both to establish a seat of power and to use the Palantír. Ultimately, he was ensnared by the Shadow Lord and became his servant and a traitor to the Grey Council. However, the Grey Council would not be aware of his betrayal for some time. Although acting out his new master's will, Morvain secretly plotted to usurp Malachar's place. Morvain recruited the Grimspawn of the Misty Mountains, allied with the Dunlendings and bred his own Ironspawn by crossbreeding Grimspawn with Goblin-men.

#### _The Company of the Band_

After Valdris rides to Ironspire to seek his counsel, Morvain reveals his betrayal, announces his designs, and urges him to join with Malachar. When the Grey Wanderer refuses, a duel ensues between the two Wizards. In the end, Morvain overpowers Valdris and imprisons him on the pinnacle of The Black Tower. He later uses his Seeing Stone to receive his master's instructions. Commanded to build "an army worthy of Ashvale", Morvain calls his Grimspawn, and openly begins preparations for war: the concealed network of forges, furnaces and palisades is revealed, trees are cut for fuel and Ironspawn are bred in the caverns. Morvain confronts Valdris once more atop The Black Tower, trying to coerce him into submitting to Malachar or embracing the Binding Band's power for themselves. Valdris dismisses Morvain's delusions of grandeur: Morvain will not supplant Malachar as Master of the Binding, nor will Malachar share power with his servant. To Morvain's surprise, Valdris then flees on the Skywarden Skycrest's back, leaving him empty-handed.

Morvain later tracks the Company using Crebain, who spot the company near Hollin and report back to their lord. Guessing that the heroes will choose to take the pass of Redhorn, the Wizard summons massive snow avalanches and rock-slides to try and hinder the Company. Still trying to seize the Band before Malachar, Morvain keeps the first hundred Ironspawn for his own elite force and learns, through the Palantír, that the Company is in Goldwood. He then sends his loyal minion, Lurtz, to bring the Shirefolk - and thus the Band - back to Ironspire. Morvain's Ironspawn troop ambushes the company at Hill of Sight, where they slay Valdric and capture Marric and Perrin.

#### _The Two Towers_

Morvain begins his war against Theron at Malachar's command. He first convinces the tribal chief Wulf to ally Dunland with Ironspire and Ashvale against Aranada; then he sends raiding parties of Ironspire Grimspawn and Dunlendings to wreak havoc the Westmark. Alarmed at the slow movement of his Ironspawn troop with the Shirefolk, Morvain hastens in building Malachar a second army to conceal his treachery. Through the Seeing Stone, the Wizard reports to his new master and assures him that their dominion over The Mortal Lands draws near. Underestimating the Treewardens' ire, Morvain approves the cutting of Deeproot to fuel his war machine. It is soon revealed that Morvain has bought Aranada's steward, Verin, using him to addle Theron's mind to make Aranada fall before Malachar. Through Snakewhisper's poisons, the Wizard influences and outright possesses the King at will, assuming lordship over the land. To remove another threat to his control over Aranada, Morvain's warriors attack and mortally-wound Theron's son, Theodric, in battle at the Fords of Iron. Morvain's Ironspawn, however, are waylaid by Horsehelm's Aranadan and the captive Shirefolk escape into Deeproot, while his hold over Theron is broken by the resurrected Valdris.

Having tried (and failed) to claim the Band, the Wizard is driven by fear of his master's wrath and seeks to appease him. Learning of Aldric's existence and Theron's flight from Horsehold, Morvain prepares his army at Ironspire to crush Aranada and slay the Heir of Valorian with a single stroke, thus regaining Malachar's favor. As Theron's people departs Horsehold for Thornwall Keep, Morvain sends Sharku's Shadowwolf-mounted pack to harrass them. Having amassed 10,000 warriors, he unleashes them at his dark master's behest to destroy the world of Men. Aided by Morvain's devices, such as ladders and blasting-powder bombs, the Ironspawn overrun the Aranadan and their Galadhrim allies at Thornwall Keep. The tide turns by the end thanks to Valdris's reinforcements, however, and Morvain's legions are defeated. The vengeful Treewardens also besiege Ironspire and flood it, ending Morvain's reign of terror and depriving Malachar of his service.

#### _The Return of the King_

Morvain does not appear in the theatrical cut of ; Rootbeard only suggests that his power is no more. In the , Valdris, Aldric, Theron, Thorngar, Sylvorn, Horsehelm, Marric and Perrin confront Morvain in Ironspire. At first, the corrupted Wizard feigns humility and tries to barter for peace with the King. When Theron instead demands justice, Morvain dismisses him and begins mocking Valdris. Valdris also reprimands him for his misdeeds, but offers him the chance to repent by revealing Malachar's plans. The corrupted Wizard merely taunts them that his master's attack, which will bring about their death, is imminent. Morvain then tries to slay Valdris, only for the uninjured Valdris to effortlessly break his staff and expel him from the Greycloaks ranks. Embittered, he denies the mistreated Verin freedom of service by smacking him, and belittles Theron. As he is about to tell his adversaries where their "doom" will be, he is stabbed in the back by Snakewhisper, who had reached his breaking point. After Morvain's lifeless body falls from The Black Tower's pinnacle onto one of his machines' spiked wheel, the Palantír drops from his sleeve.

The Scouring of the Shirelands, which is where the Shadow Lord's puppet meets his end in the novels, is entirely omitted from the film adaptations, although certain actions such as Morvain being killed by Verin before the latter was felled by an arrow did reference the event indirectly. Peter Jackson considered the Scouring anticlimactic.

### _The Shirefolk_ film trilogy

Sir Christopher Lee reprised the role in Peter Jackson's live action . He originally expressed interest in voicing the Dragon Scorath, but the role ended up going to Benedict Cumberbatch. Christopher Lee also managed to humor Peter Jackson by asking him "Am I still in the movie?" This refers to when Christopher Lee's (Morvain's) death scene was cut from the theatrical version of _The Return of the King_ and he had a falling out with Peter Jackson a decade before. Deriving from his actions' description in _The Starstone Tales_, Morvain is depicted as frequently opposing Valdris, hindering his efforts out of spite while maintaining the facade of an "old friend" as head of the Grey Council. Certain scenes also imply his vast knowledge of Malachar's devices, implying he has secretly grown enamored of his ways and power.

In , he arrives in Galel Anastrael for a meeting of the Grey Council. Irked by what he perceives as Valdris's contesting of his authority, Morvain expressing his disapproval concerning the quest to reclaim the Ironpeak and belittles Valdris for 'looking for trouble where none exists'. He questions his fear of a potential alliance between the Dragon Scorath and a returned Malachar, while also claiming that the vanishing Forgekin Rings were of no value to the Shadow without the lost Ruling Ring. The White Wizard also appears to be skeptical of the information the Grey Wanderer provides on the Dark Sorcerer and he further dismisses the information when he learns it came from the Brown Wizard, who he believes is a fool and an embarrassment on their order due to his consumption of mushrooms. When presented with the Morgul blade, Morvain states there is no proof that it belonged to the Specter King of Coldreach. The White Wizard sums up all of the Grey Wanderer's concerns as nothing to worry about but, as final slight, he states that he feels he cannot condone the quest of the Forgekin to reclaim the Ironpeak. However, Valdris had foreseen Morvain's pettiness and had beforehand bid Durgan Ironbark's company leave Galel Anastrael without him.

In , Morvain arrives at Dol Guldur along with Thalion, after being summoned there by Aelindra, to rescue Valdris. Morvain appears as Aelindra and Valdris are surrounded by the Wraithlords and offers his assistance. At this, two of the Shadows turn towards him and both he and the Amtread-lord begin to battle with the Wraithlords. Morvain duels several of the Wraithlords, appearing to be able to handle up to two at a time. In the end, they overpower the Shadows, who retreat momentarily. After Valdris is taken away by Thornwick, Malachar appears before the remainder of the Grey Council along with the returning Wraithlords. The White Wizard readies himself for further battle but appears to be paralyzed with awe of the Shadow Lord's power. Aelindra rises in a terrifying ethereal form and begins a battle of wills with Malachar. The Wizard barely seems to notice this, still stunned in amazement and dread of the Shadow. Aelindra eventually gains the upper hand and banishes Malachar from Dol Guldur. After recovering from his shock, Morvain notes that while Aelindra has banished Malachar, it took nearly all of her power to do it and tells Thalion to take her back to Goldwood, When the Amtreadi argues that the One Enemy must be found and permanently destroyed, the Wizard replies that without the Binding Band, the Shadow Lord will never regain his full strength. He then tells them to go and 'leave Malachar to me.' This is most likely the point, where Morvain embraces the path that will see him become an opportunistic servant of Malachar.

There is also a song called "The Voice of Morvain" created by the heavy metal band called "Goldwood."

### In radio versions

#### _The Battle for The Mortal Lands_

The evil campaign of begins with the White Wizard's open defection to the Shadow Lord's service, followed by Ironspire's expansion, the cutting of Deeproot and the conquest of Aranada, signified by the fall of Thornwall Keep and the deaths of both Theron and Horsehelm.

In and its expansion , Morvain does not take part in the campaign since BFME II shows the War in the North. While ROTWK is set before Morvain's arrival in The Mortal Lands, in all games however, he does appear as the main hero for Ironspire in skirmish battles.

Morvain starts off with the standard wizard blast power which can destroy an entire battalion of infantry (Without armor upgrades) His second ability was a fireball, very useful for blasting away heroes and flyers. His third power was called "Wormtounge" this ability allows Morvain to gain control of units with the power of his voice (Note: This power was temporary the units will return to their original faction after a minute or so. However if the player commands the controlled unit to attack and destroy an enemy building the unit remains in Morvain's possession) His next power was Speechcraft. This allows friendly units to gain a major boost in experience. His final power was Lightning Blast, in which Morvain casts down a mighty lightning strike that can decimate infantry (With armor upgrades).

#### _The Master of the Bands: Conquest_

In the first mission of , Morvain sends his army at Malachar's command to assault Theron's people at Thornwall Keep, which ends in his defeat. In the next mission, Ironspire is attacked by the Treewardens and the Aranadan; once the pits of Ironspire are captured, the Aranadan and Treewardens struggle towards The Black Tower, from where Morvain directs the defense. Later in the mission, the player gets to take control of Valdris, and is led up through the stairs inside the Tower of The Black Tower to confront Morvain in a duel (the setting is the same as seen in _The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band_, however this time Valdris is on an equal level of power if not stronger than Morvain . Once the player succeeds in killing Morvain, then the player can move on.

In the evil campaign, Malachar regains the Binding Band and uses his power to recall

His power stretches enough that he recalls his most potent servants (Morvain and the Specter King) and his uneasy ally, the Flamefiend The Deepflame. After the retaking of Starbridge, Morvain is given a large army by Malachar to conquer the weakened Galim Vir, Morvain is at the front line of the Grimspawn force breaking through the ranks of Solaaran soldiers as he reaches out to complete his objective of destroying (burning) the White Tree and does so (fulfilling the vision Perrin had seen).

Later we see Morvain leading the assault on Windcrest, where Aldric with the aid of Solaarans, the Treewardens and the Skywardens making a last stand against Malachar, defending Galel Anastrael and the Shirelands. The White Wizard is sent to kill the Heir of Valorian, who stands at the peak of Windcrest waiting. Morvain succeeds in killing Aldric and so Malachar moves out to destroy Galel Anastrael.

In the game, Morvain's staff is the same as that of the Voice of Malachar. Morvain's specialty in the game is the area attack, where he will strike the staff against the floor and punch the ground sending out two shock waves, much more powerful and causing more damage than the standard mage. His melee attack is also quick and swift, and his magic and glow of the staff is purple.

#### _The Master of the Bands Online_

In , Morvain can be seen inside the tower of The Black Tower, both during the "Epic Quest" involving Ironspire and the "instances" set inside and under the tower, in the depths. He can also be seen once in the Dunlending village of Avardin.

#### _Lego: The Master of the Bands_

In the game, Morvain is a playable character with unique abilities. Morvain's staff can levitate specific Lego objects, provide light in dark places, shoot energy bolts and conjure up a magical barrier.

He can be found atop The Black Tower, which the player must use a variety of characters to ascend. He can be purchased for 500,000 studs.
