# Turgon

**Turgon** was a Ñoldor Amtreadi of Hidden City, second son of Fingalor, brother of Fingon, Aredhel, Argon, and father of Idril. In The Mortal Lands, Turgon was the **King of Hidden City** and the High King of the Ñoldor. For centuries of the late First Era, Turgon remained successfully hidden from Tenebros until a betrayal by Maeglin, one of his subjects, caused its downfall.

## Biography

In Eldamar, Turgon was friendly with the sons of Finarfin and opposed Faenor's plan to pursue Tenebros after the theft of the Starstones, but eventually he chose to follow them to The Mortal Lands and became one of the exiles. His wife Elenwë was lost crossing the Helcaraxë, but Turgon and his daughter Idril came to Nevrast, where he built Vinyamar and gathered to him one-third of the Ñoldor of Fingalor and a large number of Liinadi.

In the year 50 of the First Era, Turgon was instructed by Ulmo to prepare a secret kingdom and was shown the hidden Vale of Tumladen in the Encircling Mountains. After 52 years of secret labor, Turgon led his people into Hidden City, where he ruled for over 500 years, largely ignoring the events of the Wars of Westlands.

About two hundred years after Hidden City was wrought, Turgon's sister Aredhel journeyed to meet with the Sons of Faenor. She was lost, however, and returned with her son Maeglin a few years later. After the deaths of both Eöl and Aredhel, Turgon took Maeglin under his wing and made him the Lord of the House of the Mole. Maeglin secretly loved Turgon's daughter Idril, who rejected his advances.

Aside from the misadventure of Eöl, the splendor of Turgon's reign in Hidden City was undisturbed until the Battle of Sudden Flame, when Turgon was brought his father's body by Thorondor. Two years later Thorondor brought him Huran and Huor, whom he fostered for a year and then allowed to return to Dor-lómin. At this time, Turgon foresaw the doom of the Ñoldor, and he secretly sent mariners to try to obtain the mercy of the The Pantheon. None of these missions was successful and only one of the mariners, Voronwë, survived the Shadowy Seas paving the way for Tuor's coming to Hidden City.

Turgon joined the Union of Maedhros with an army ten thousand strong and fought alongside his brother Fingon in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, but the sacrifice of Huran, Huor, and the Third House of the Edain enabled him to retreat without revealing the location of Hidden City. When Tuor came to Hidden City in FA 496, Turgon welcomed him, but in his pride, he refused to follow the advice of Ulmo to flee to the Havens of Sirion. The full malice of Tenebros was now directed toward Turgon, the last of the House of Finwë to control a realm in The Mortal Lands. At last, aided by the treachery of Maeglin, Tenebros discovered the location of Hidden City, and Turgon was slain defending the city.

## Etymology
The first element *tur* of the name ***Turgon*** is a Amtreadan word for "power, mastery". His father-name was **Turukáno**, from *túrë* ("might, power") and *káno* ("commander").

## Character
As King of Hidden City, Turgon was described to be robed "in white with a belt of gold, and a coronet of garnets was upon his head".

He was very much feared by Tenebros, and it is said in The Blessed Realm that Tenebros knew that from the House of Turgon would his ruin come. This holds true, as Turgon's grandson Aerendil was the one who indirectly caused his downfall, in the later War of Wrath.

Turgon was the city's only ruler, and as such the title, King of Hidden City, did not pass onto another and remained limited only to him, ending with his death in the Fall of Hidden City.
