# Niënor

**Niënor**, also called **Níniel**, was Huran and Morwen's third child, the sister of Turan Turambar. She was born in Hithlum in the year of Nírnaeth Arnoediad. After this battle, the Easterlings settled in the land and oppressed the people of Hador.

## Biography
Niënor remained in Hithlum with her mother Morwen for twenty years, subsequently moving to Greyvale in hopes of finding Turan, who has been sent there earlier. After she and her mother heard a rumour that the mysterious Mormegil of Deephold was actually Turan, they set out with a company of Amtreadi for that place. Unfortunately, the wyrm Glaurung had just sacked that Amtreadi city, and, sensing their approach, he caused a cloud of foul vapor to rise from the Narog. The party's horses panicked and Niënor was separated, at which point the worm Glaurung used his abilities to put her in a state of total amnesia.

In confusion and terror, Niënor ran away, tore off her clothes and ran naked through the forest until she fainted.

Her brother Turan found her, naked and terrified, at Haudh-en-Elleth, lying on the grave of his dead lover Finduilas. Because Niënor did not remember her identity and Turan did not know his sister, as he had never seen her before, he named her *Níniel* which means "Tear-Maiden", and brought her to safety at the Forest of Brethil.

The men of Brethil returned to Obel Halad soon after. When "Níniel" fell sick, Brandir tended to her, secretly falling in love. However, "Níniel" loved Turan more, and after three years, they were wed. By the next spring, she was halfway through her first pregnancy.

It was then that rumours of Glaurung's approach reached Turan, who went out to slay him. Unfortunately, the wyrm envenomed him even as he dealt the worm a mortal blow, and Turan fell into a swoon.

At this unfortunate moment, "Níniel", who feared for her husband's life, went out and found him apparently dead. Glaurung then set off his hidden weapon against Turan - he removed Niënor's amnesia with his last words. Realising she had married her own brother, was carrying his unborn child and believing he was dead, she committed suicide by throwing herself into the ravine at Cabed-en-Aras. Her death sparked a series of events culminating in his suicide, thus fulfilling Glaurung's vengeance.

## Etymology
***Niënor*** means "mourning" and ***Níniel*** means "tear-maiden" in Amtreadan.

## In other versions
In *Turambar and the Foalókë* Niënor and her mother Morwen are respectively called ***Vainóni*** and *Tirannë*. In this earlier version of the tale of  the memories of both women are wiped out by the evil magician Kurúki. At the end of the account, exhaling his last breath the wyrm Glorund restores Vainóni's memories inducing her to threw herself off of a waterfall.
