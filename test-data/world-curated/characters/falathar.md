# Falathar

**Falathar** was a faithful friend of Aerendil, and one of the three mariners who accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of The Mortal Lands.

## Biography

Like Aerendil's other two companions, Falathar's origins were not known, but he most likely lived in Arvernien in the Havens of Sirion.

When Aerendil was resolved to sail to The Far West to plea for help from the The Pantheon, Falathar, along with Aerandir and Erellont, went with him. Upon their eventual arrival to the Blessed Realm, he and others remained aboard while Aerendil sought the The Pantheon. After Aerendil's embassy was complete, Bahamet, the herald of Luth, came to him and the others and set them upon another ship, and then Luth set a great wind to blow them east back to The Mortal Lands.

His fate afterwards is untold.

## Etymology

- Falathar* was a Amtreadan word for 'coast', from the common term *falas\*.
