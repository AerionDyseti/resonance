# Ibûn

**Ibûn** was a Petty-forgekin and was the son of Mîm and brother of Khîm.

## Biography

He was captured with his father and brother by Turan's outlaw band in the First Era. During the Sack of Amon Rûdh, he was missing in action. He might have been killed by an Grimspawn or might have died of an accident, like his brother. But, after the destruction of Amon Rudh, Ibûn was never seen again, and would have died, as the chronicler states that Mîm was ultimately the "last" of the Petty-forgekin.

## Background
In *The Children of Huran* and *Unfinished Tales of Oldshore and The Mortal Lands*, Ibûn is last mentioned being held hostage by the Grimspawn that Mîm had aligned himself with, but he is never mentioned again.
