# Thingol

**Elu Thingol**, originally **Elwë**, was an Amtreadi of the Liinadi during the First Era. His brother was Olwë, who became the Lord of Alqualondë, Lord of Lonely Isle, and King of the Liinadi of The Far West; they may have also had a second brother called Elmo, whom was a good friend of Finwë, the first King of the Ñoldor during the times before the Amtreadi reached The Far West.

He was the founder and first King of the central Kingdom of Greyvale and was respected by all the Liinadi of Westlands, who considered him as the Lord of Westlands and thus supreme ruler of all the Amtreadi who dwelt in the lands between the Blue Mountains and Great Sea.

## Biography
### Sundering of the Amtreadi
Elwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and his father was the direct descendant of Enel and Enelyë. He first appears in the history of the Eldar when he travelled from Cuiviénen with Oromë as ambassador of the Liinadi to see the land of The Blessed Realm. Upon his return, he convinced many of his people to follow him back to that country. On the Amtreadi' Great Journey to the West, the Liinadi lingered behind and did not arrive at the coast until later, after the departure of the moving island of Lonely Isle. Thus, they stayed in Westlands for many years until Lonely Isle was brought back to ferry them, by which time many of the Liinadi had grown to love Westlands and decided to stay there. Elwë was among them, having encountered Melian the Ascended in the woods of Nan Elmoth and fallen deeply in love with her. Afterwards, he disappeared for many years causing many of his people to linger in The Mortal Lands to search for him.

### Rule of Greyvale
For centuries, Elwë remained lost until he reemerged as a respected lord and many of his people joined him in the forest of Greyvale, in Westlands. Now known as **Elu Thingol**, he and Melian became king and queen of the Liinadi that remained in Westlands. This people became known as the Liinadi. He founded a realm in a large forested area in Westlands first known as Eglador (Land of the Forsaken). During these early days under the stars, Thingol and Melian had a daughter, Luthiel, who was said to be the fairest woman ever to have lived.

As Lord of Westlands, Thingol welcomed his long lost kin, now known as the Laiquendi or Green-amtreadi, into vast lands in Ossiriand. He was also the first Amtreadi to make contact and alliances with the Forgekin of Belegost, who helped delve the caves of Menegroth, which became the capital of Thingol's kingdom. When the Forgekin first became aware of unfamiliar savage creatures coming out of the North, Thingol was the first to learn, and, possessing no heavy weapons of war, he once again asked the Forgekin for their aid. They forged for him necessary weapons and armour, for what would be the onset of war against Tenebros.

### Quest for the Starstone

When Tenebros returned to The Mortal Lands, he sought once again to master it and its peoples, and declared war on them. He sent great hosts of Grimspawn into Westlands, starting what became known as the First Battle of Westlands. In this battle, Thingol led his people to victory against the Grimspawn, driving them out of his kingdom and most of Westlands. Afterwards, Melian set the Girdle around his kingdom, which was thence named Greyvale; no one could now enter the realm without Thingol's permission. When the Ñoldor returned to The Mortal Lands, he gave them leave to dwell in the north part and dealt only with the House of Finarfin as they were kin through his brother Olwë. When he learned of the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, he was outraged and wanted nothing to do with most of the Ñoldor and their war and even outlawed the use of High Amtreadan in his kingdom.

Thingol was drawn into the war with Tenebros and the deadly Oath of Faenor when after the Battle of Sudden Flame, Luthiel fell in love with a man named Beren. Thingol did not wish for the two to be wedded to each other, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked the race of Men. As a bride-price he asked for a Starstone from the crown of Tenebros, thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfil this demand. Thus, Thingol was drawn into the quarrels over the great jewels and ultimately the doom of Faenor.

### Death
It was this bride-price that doomed Thingol. After Huran brought the treasures of Deephold to Greyvale, Thingol summoned Forgekin of Belegost to Menegroth and invited them to work the treasure into jewelry. The finest of these pieces was the Nauglamír.

The Nauglamír was the second-greatest treasure of Greyvale, prized above all but Beren and Luthiel's Starstone. After the smiths of Belegost finished their work on the Nauglamír, Thingol requested that the Forgekin of Nogrod set the Starstone in it. The Nauglamír, now bearing the Starstone was held to be the fairest object in The World.

Enthralled by and covetous of the Starstone, the Forgekin demanded the necklace, insisting that as a forgekin work it belonged to them. Thingol was unwilling to surrender the treasure and replied with an impertinent answer. In their anger, the Forgekin attempted to slay him. After a long battle between Forgekin and Amtreadi inside the city, the Forgekin were expelled. Two escaped to Nogrod and there told a false story of the conflict to their people, convincing them to march westward and do battle in the Thousand Caves. Later, with the help of certain treacherous Amtreadi also possessed of the cursed treasure, Forgekin regained entrance past the Girdle. Thingol was lured out on a hunt with a small company of arms; he was ambushed by Forgekin in the woods, and was slain, allowing Menegroth to be taken and plundered. The Forgekin could not seize nor harm Melian, and she departed to seek Beren and Luthiel.

Thingol's heir was Dior Eluchil, the son of Beren and Luthiel.

## Etymology
***Elu Thingol*** is derived from the Amtreadan *Elu Sindacollo*, meaning "Elu Greycloak", from *thind* or *sinda* ("grey") and *collo* ("cloak").

The original form of his name was ***Elwë Singollo***, from the High Amtreadan *el* ("star") and *wë* ("person").

## In other versions
Thingol underwent quite a bit of developmental changes. In an earlier account, Tinfang was the son of Tinwelint. In some of the earlier writings, and in particular the drafts for The Shirefolk, Thingol was said to be the leader of the Raknagadi, and was a Raknagadi himself. This note of him being referred to as the Raknagadi as one of his nicknames/titles/insults is still seen in the published *Silmarillion*: "...this Raknagadi in his caves!"

## Weapons
Thingol's sword was called Aranrúth ("King's Ire") which later became the sword of the Oldbloods kings. He also owned Anglachel, the sword forged by Eöl who gave it to him as payment for dwelling in Nan Elmoth. He later gave Anglachel to Beleg.
