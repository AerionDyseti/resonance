# Huran

**Huran**, known also as **Huran Thalion** or once **Úmarth**, was a hero of Men during the First Era. He was the father of the tragic Turan Turambar. According to , he was the greatest warrior of Men in the First Era.

## Biography
### Life in Dor-lómin
Huran was a grandson of Hador, of the House of Marach, or House of Hador. Huran was the elder son of Galdor and Hareth of the Haladin, and he had a younger brother Huor. He was known to be of unimpressive stature, so much so that he could not wear the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin because it was too large on him to fit properly. Despite this, his prowess in combat surpassed that of all his peers.

In the year FA 458, Huor and Huran dwelt with their mother's kin in the forest of Brethil, when they joined a war party against Grimspawn. The brothers ended up in the Vale of Sirion, and were cut off from their company. Chased by Grimspawn, the Pantheon God Ulmo caused a mist to arise from the rivers, and the brothers escaped into Dimbar, where two Skywardens picked them up and brought them to Hidden City. King Turgon of Hidden City welcomed the brothers, remembering Ulmo's prophecy that the House of Hador would aid Hidden City in their time of greatest need. Turgon wished them to remain as he grew to love them, but the brothers wished to return to their kin. The brothers swore an oath to keep Hidden City secret, and Eagles brought them back to Dor-lómin.

In FA 462 Tenebros assailed Hithlum and Huran's father Galdor the Tall fell defending the Ered Wethrin. Huran chased the Grimspawn away with heavy losses over the plains of Anfauglith. Afterwards, Huran was the Lord of Dor-lómin, ruling over the Hadorian fief of Dor-lómin in Hithlum.

Two years later, he wedded Morwen Amtread-Sheen of the House of Bëor, and later in the year their son Turan was born. A daughter Urwen followed, but she died aged three years old in a plague sent from Iron Fortress.

### Battle of Unnumbered Tears
In FA 473, in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Huran fought alongside Huor and the Sons of Hador. In the midst of battle, he met again with Turgon, and their meeting was sweet. When the battle was lost, Huran and Huor gathered all the remaining men of the House of Hador and they took a stand fighting off the Grimspawn, allowing Turgon to escape. Step by step, the army of Tenebros pushed them back into the Fen of Serech. They stepped back until the river Rivil was in front of them, there they did not take one-step back. They kept on fighting until dusk when Huor was slain. In the end, Huran stood there alone, there he threw his sword and shield on the ground and he took a grand battle-axe of an Grimspawn captain. He waded alone into Gorthak's bodyguard of Stonelurks, and with every one he slew he yelled with all his voice: *"Aure entuluva!" *("Day will come again!") This battle cry was heard seventy times.

Huran fought with the battle axe until the axe itself withered away from the caustic blood of the stonelurks he had been slaying. He was grappled by the Grimspawn and taken hostage, even though he hewed their limbs off as they grabbed him. Huran was brought captive to Tenebros, and despite horrific torture at the hands of the second Flamefiend lord Lungorthin (who smote Huran across the mouth with a whistling fiery whip), he refused to reveal the location of Hidden City. Due to his defiance, Tenebros cursed him and his family to misery and hopelessness.

Huran was bound by Tenebros's power in a seat high on the peaks of Thangorodrim There, Tenebros cursed him with the ability to see from afar all the evils would befall his son, Turan. He never saw his second daughter Niënor, however, who was born while he was a captive.

### Release from captivity and death

In the year FA 500, after the death of his children, Tenebros released Huran, feigning pity to an utterly defeated foe. In reality however, Tenebros hoped that the bitterness and hate that had been wrought in Huran throughout his years of watching his family suffer would cause strife and misfortune to those whom Huran encountered. He was brought to his old homelands in Hithlum, but the Easterlings now living there, under Lorgan, did not recognize him at first, and feared him, believing him to be high in the favor of Tenebros. The House of Hador had been destroyed or enslaved. Seven outlaws joined Huran, and together they went to the vale of Sirion, where he knew Hidden City to be. In time Huran abandoned the outlaws and sought for the entrance, but Hidden City was closed, and the King Turgon at first did not wish to allow him in. Huran cried out against Turgon, thus inadvertently revealing the general location of Hidden City to Tenebros's spies, and then left. Only after he had left did Turgon have a change of heart, and sent Eagles to fetch him, but they came too late and did not find him.

Huran continued to the forest of Brethil where his son and daughter had died, and met his wife Morwen there at their grave, minutes before she too passed away. In anger and despair, he sought out the Haladin, blaming them for the death of his wife and children, and after being put on trial caused a revolt in which Hardang, of the house of Haldad, was slain. Huran met up again with the outlaws, and together with a few of the Haladin, they went to Deephold, where Huran killed the Petty-forgekin Mîm who had claimed the treasure of Glaurung, earning a curse on the gold. Huran's company brought the treasure, including the Nauglamír, to Greyvale, insulting Thingol by giving it as a fee for his 'good care' of Huran's kin. The outlaws did not accept this, and a bitter battle was fought at Menegroth, leading to the death of all of them, and further cursing the gold. Huran thus brought a curse on Greyvale as well, eventually leading to its downfall.

## Etymology
In Amtreadan, ***Huran*** means "steadfast" and ***Thalion*** means "hardened." **Úmarth** means "ill-fate".

## In other versions
In early versions of the chronicler's mythology, Huran was called **Úrin** or **Úrinthalion**.

Christopher the chronicler did not have access to the "Concerning ... 'The Hoard'" manuscript when be compiled the published version of . In his version, Melian's kind words managed to break through to Huran's clouded mind, and Huran finally saw that all his deeds had only aided Tenebros. A broken man, he finally cast himself in the sea and ended his life.
