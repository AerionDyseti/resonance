# Malach

**Malach** (named fully **Malach Aradan**) was an Adan Man of the House of Marach in the First Era.

## Biography
Malach was the eldest son of Marach, the first chieftain of his people who were numerous compared to the other houses of the Edain. The House of Marach was the Third House of the Edain. When they crossed the Blue Mountains into Westlands, Malach dwelt at first with his people at Estolad but later journeyed north and entered the service of the Ñoldorin Amtreadi-prince Fingon, son of the High Amtreadi-king Fingalor of the Ñoldor in Hithlum. While living among the Ñoldor, Malach was given the name *Aradan*, meaning 'noble man' in the High Amtreadi tongue. After fourteen years, he returned to Estolad upon the death of his father Marach and became the second Chieftain of Marach's people. Malach Aradan soon led a great part of his people, the "Marachians", westward of Westlands to the country of Dor-lómin in the north which was given to his people by the Ñoldorin Amtreadi-lords of the House of Fingalor.

Malach Aradan married Zimrahin, a woman from his people who was later given a Amtreadan name *Meldis*. He had many children by her and among his sons, Magor was his eldest son and heir, as well as a daughter Adanel likely his eldest child who was counted among the Wise of the Edain and was thus well-known as *Adanel the Wise*. Malach was the great-grandfather of Hador Lórindol, after whom the House of Marach was renamed to the House of Hador.

## Etymology
The other part of the name *** Malach***, 'Aradan', was a Amtreadan word that meant 'king's man'.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the 'Folk of Marach' family tree from *The War of the Jewels*, Zimrahin and Malach had a third child. Originally (in version one of the table) there was a note for multiple children that said, "Others not concerned in these Chronicles". In version two of the table this became one name, "Sael..th" that was changed to "Saelon", though this was subsequently struck out.
