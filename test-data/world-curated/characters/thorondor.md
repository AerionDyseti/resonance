# Thorondor

**Thorondor** (Amtreadan; IPA: "Eagle Lord") was the king of the Eagles of The Mortal Lands during the First Era.

## Biography

Thorondor was sent by Luth, King of the The Pantheon, to watch over the Ñoldor after they arrived in Westlands. The Eldar first encountered him when he helped Fingon rescue Maedhros from imprisonment from Thangorodrim, upon which he had apparently made his home for a short time. Later, Thorondor and the rest of the Skywardens settled in the Crissaegrim. When Hidden City was built, Thorondor became the ever vigilant guardian of the city. He rescued Fingalor's body from defilement after Tenebros killed him, giving the Shadow Lord a scar on his face. He, Windcrest, and Skycrest rescued Beren and Luthiel when Iron Fortress was aroused.

When Hidden City fell, Thorondor rescued the survivors. During the War of Wrath, Thorondor and Aerendil led the Eagles in battle with the Dragons, and may have fought with Ancalagon the Black.

## Fate

In the chronicler's writings, Thorondor is not mentioned after the War of Wrath.

Speculatively, it is possible that Thorondor returned to The Blessed Realm, although his descendants remained behind, including Skycrest. It is also possible that he never left The Mortal Lands, being the Lord of the Skywardens during the Third Era.

## Appearance

Thorondor was presumably the greatest of all the Eagles in terms of size, with his wingspan measuring at 30 fathoms (180 feet or nearly 55 meters).

## Etymology

The name **_Thorondor_** was Amtreadan for "Eagle Lord", from the words _thoron_ ("eagle") and _taur_ ("lord, king"). The High Amtreadan form of the same was **Sorontar**.
