# Thragol II

**Thragol II** was the father of Durgan II, and the son of King Thragor, making him a direct descendant of Grundin the Deathless. After his father Thragor was beheaded by Azrak in Shadowdeep, Thragol became the rightful King under the Mountain as well as the King of Grundin Folk.

## Biography
### Early life
Thragol was born in the Ironpeak to Thragor, who was King under the Mountain. He married sometime before TA 2746 and had three children: Durgan, Frerin, and Dís.

### Life in exile
Thragol fled Ironpeak with his father, his three children, and the surviving Forgekin of the Ironpeak when the wyrm Scorath descended on the mountain in TA 2770, desolating the kingdom and claiming its treasure. Exiled, he and his relatives wandered farther south, and they eventually settled in the hills of Dunland. They would remain in Dunland for twenty years, reduced to poverty.

Years after the destruction of Ironpeak, poverty took a toll on the mind of King Thragor, rendering him restless and desperate. He sought to journey away searching for a scrap of wealth, though he did not specify Shadowdeep. At their parting, he gave to his son Thragol his Ring of power and the Map and Key to the Side-door of the Ironpeak. He departed from his people with a single companion, his only and old friend named Nár.

### War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn

Nár would return to their dwelling in Dunland many weeks later, but he would return alone. He told the tale to Thragol of what had become of his father Thragor, who had brashly ventured into Shadowdeep, despite the pleas of Nár not to go in, but he did not return. Days later, it was revealed that the King had been branded and murdered by Azrak the Grimspawn, who claimed to now rule the ancient mansions of Grundin Folk.

When Thragol heard Nár's recounting of what had become of his father and that an Grimspawn was ruling their ancestral home, he wept and tore his beard and then fell silent. For seven days, he sat and said no word. However, on the seventh day, he stood up and declared, "This cannot be borne!" These words were the beginning of the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn.

Thragol sent messengers to deliver the tale to all the corners of the world. Word was sent to all the Houses of the other Forgekin Fathers. The kings of the other Houses answered to Thragol's call to vengeance, as they all saw this heinous deed committed by Azrak to be a profound dishonor to the heir of the eldest of their race, and it raised their fury. While most of the war was fought in the mines and tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains, the climactic Battle of Azanulbizar took place beneath the East-gate of Shadowdeep in the valley of Azanulbizar. Heavy losses were inflicted on both sides. Frerin, the younger brother of Durgan Ironbark, was among those that fell. Thragol himself had been wounded in the battle and suffered a grievous eye-wound. The tide of war, at last, turned when fresh reinforcements from the Iron Hills arrived late. Realizing that his hordes were being annihilated and routed by the Forgekin, Azrak turned and attempted to flee back to the gate but was slain by Dagor Ironfoot, bringing about an end to the war. 

### Later life and capture
Afterward, Thragol led the remainder of his people – among them his eldest son Durgan Ironbark – back to Dunland, where they dwelt for a while. Eventually, they relocated to the northern Blue Mountains, where they made their dwelling. After some time, they showed signs of prosperity, and their numbers slowly began to increase.
Many years later, Thragol grew older, and he became restless, fed by the Band of Binding in his possession. His desire to reclaim his kingdom of the Ironpeak grew. In TA 2841, he and a group of followers, including Borin and Dwalin, left their dwelling in the Blue Mountains and journeyed into Wilderland. The servants of Malachar pursued them, and one morning in TA 2845, in the eaves of Gloomwood, his companions awoke to find that Thragol was missing. They searched in vain for him for days, but he could not be found at all. It was later learned that he had been captured and imprisoned in the pits of Malachar's stronghold of Dol Guldur in southern Gloomwood. There he was tortured, and Malachar took from him the last of the Forgekin Bands of Binding and left him there to die.

Before Thragol's death – while on a mission to Dol Guldur – Valdris the Grey came upon Thragol and was given the map and key made by his father, Thragor. Thragol appeared so diminished that he had forgotten almost everything, including his name. Valdris promised to deliver it to Durgan but could not confirm that this Forgekin was, in fact, Thragol due to Thragol's loss of memory. There he died.

### Legacy
Years later, Valdris met with Durgan near the village of Crossway. There, Valdris promised to help Durgan on his quest to reclaim Ironpeak. The most notable way Valdris helped was when he invited the Shirefolk Jasper Burrows on the journey to act as the company's burglar.

Several decades later, during the Council of Thalion, Glorin revealed that part of Borin's motivation for attempting to re-enter Shadowdeep was to find the last Forgekin Band of Binding, which was last seen in Thragor's possession. Valdris regretfully informed them that Thragor had passed the ring to Thragol, and when Thragol was captured in Dol Guldur, the ring was stripped from his possession. Glorin mourned this loss, wondering aloud when, if ever, the Forgekin would have their vengeance against the Shadow Lord Malachar.

## Etymology
It is possible that the name 'Thragol' could have been inspired by the character *Þráinn*, from the Norse prose work known as Njál's saga. The two names are phonetically very similar. If this interpretation is true, it would give the name 'Thragol' the definition of 'stubborn', or 'obstinate'.

## In adaptations
### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
Young Thragol II is played by Michael Mizrahi and Thomas Robins in Peter Jackson's . For the extended edition scenes in the Battle of Azanulbizar and Dol Guldur in , Thragol is portrayed by British actor Sir Antony Sher.

He became heir of the lost King under the Mountain and King of Grundin Folk. When Azrak killed his father in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799, Thragol tried to restrain his son Durgan from charging towards the Pale Grimspawn and explained that Azrak was tasked to wipe out the line of Grundin. After ordering his son to stay away from the deadly Grimspawn, Thragol led a charge towards the Dimrill Gate, but was overpowered by Azrak and lost Thragor's Band of Binding to Azrak. Many Forgekin believed that Thragol was driven mad by grief and had been among the fallen, but his son Durgan had searched among the dead bodies of Shadowdeep and knew that Thragol had survived the battle. However, it was revealed that he was captured by the Dark Sorcerer and became a prisoner in Dol Guldur. During his lifetime in the old fortress, Thragol had been tortured for information about the map and key to the Ironpeak, but Thragol refused to answer and would not tell him that he gave the items to Valdris for safekeeping.

After sending Thornwick the Brown to Aelindra to tell her of Malachar's return, Valdris enters Dol Guldur's interior and begins searching for any sign of evil. Deep in the abandoned fortress, a diminished Thragol watches Valdris before jumping down onto the wizard. The two engage in battle until Valdris manages to restrain Thragol and bring him to his senses. Valdris recognizes his old friend, and Thragol tells him he has been in Dol Guldur for a lifetime. Thragol recounts the Battle of Azanulbizar and how Azrak the Defiler severed his finger that bore his Forgekin Band of Binding by a dagger. Valdris tells Thragol they must leave, but Thragol says there is no way out. Valdris informs Thragol that his son has embarked on the Quest of Ironpeak, to which Thragol says that Durgan, or anyone, must not enter the mountain.

While making their escape, Thragol continued to explain to Valdris that Scorath and Malachar, whom he calls The One, are in league with each other until Azrak himself launches a surprise attack, knocking Valdris to the floor. Thragol was terrified when he witnessed the whole army of Guldur Grimspawn that were getting ready to leave the fortress and travel to the Ironpeak. Before Azrak can deliver the killing blow, Thragol and Valdris managed to flee. As they reached the exit of the fortress, Malachar confronts them, preventing them from leaving. Since there was nowhere to run or escape, Thragol tells Valdris to tell his son, Durgan, that he loves him, to which Valdris replies he can tell Durgan himself once they get out of here. Thragol said to him that it was too late, and despite Valdris's attempts to protect him, he was grabbed by the Dark Sorcerer's shadowy tendrils and killed.
