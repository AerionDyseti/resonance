# Ar-Gimilzôr

**Ar-Gimilzôr** was the twenty-third King of Oldshore, succeeding his father Ar-Sakalthôr.

## Biography

Ar-Gimilzôr's reign was a difficult time for the Faithful (_Elendili_), who called for the return of the Oldbloods to the ways of the The Pantheon and the Amtreadi, for during this time he persecuted them for their beliefs. Use of the Amtreadan languages was forbidden in Oldshore by his order in SA 3110. He also neglected the White Tree and no longer made pilgrimage to the Aeonic Cairn. In fact, he was so distrustful of the Faithful that he forced them to move from Andúnië to the eastern part of the island near Rómenna and watched them carefully.

Ar-Gimilzôr's wife, Inzilbêth, was secretly an Amtread-friend, and she passed on her ways to their son, Tar-Seeing-Stone. She was the daughter of Lindórië, who was herself a descendant of Tar-Aldorion, the fourth King of Oldshore, and also of Tar-Calmacil. Their second son, Gimilkhâd, opposed his elder brother's policies.

## Etymology

His chosen royal name (**_Ar-Gimilzôr_**) was Adûnaic. His High Amtreadan, or 'regal', name was recorded in the Scroll of Kings as **_Tar-Telemnar_** ("Silver-flame"), a custom still observed out of superstition. Ar-Gimilzor's Adûnaic name translated is "Star-Flame".

## In other versions

In an earlier account of Ar-Gimilzôr, his wife's father is Gimilzagar, the second son of Tar-Calmacil. However, this would make Inzilbêth at least 400 years old at the time of her marriage; despite the long lives of the members of Oldbloods royal line, Inzilbêth must have been further removed from Gimilzagar, or else the Gimilizagar referred to as her father was not the same as the son of Tar-Calmacil.
