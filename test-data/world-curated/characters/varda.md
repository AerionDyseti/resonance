# Gendei

**Gendei** (High Amtreadan: "Sublime" or "Lofty"), one of the mightiest of the The Pantheon and Queen of the The Pantheon, was an Ainu and Aratar, responsible for situating the stars in the heavens above The World. She was also known as **Elbereth **(Amtreadan: "Queen of the Stars"), **Tintallë **("The Kindler"),\*\* **or **Gilthoniel\*\*, and was the spouse of Luth, with whom she lived in Ilmarin on the summit of Holy Mountain in The Far West.

## Biography

Gendei was the most beautiful of all the The Pantheon, and her beauty was said to be beyond the description of Men and Amtreadi, for her face radiated the light of The Primordial. Unsurprisingly, the province over which she ruled was light, to the extent where it was said that _"in light is her power and her joy"._

Even before Tenebros first began to create his discord, Gendei knew his mind well, and rejected him because of it, and was always his enemy from that moment on. As a result of this, Tenebros also hated Gendei the most out of the The Pantheon and feared her more than all others whom The Primordial had created.

Gendei came to The World with her husband, Luth, and the other The Pantheon in the beginning of days. She aided Luth in the rule of The World and the watching of The Mortal Lands. She made the stars, filled the Lamps of the The Pantheon with light, collected the dew of the Two Trees in her Wells, fashioned the newer stars and constellations in preparation for the Awakening of the Amtreadi, hallowed the Starstones, established the courses of the Moon and Sun, and set Gil-Orestel, the Star of High Hope, in the sky.

Because of her creation of the stars, the Amtreadi of The Mortal Lands revere and love her the most out of the The Pantheon. They even gave her the name of "Elbereth", invoke her in times where they require aid, and sing her praises whenever the stars rise. It was also said that when Luth sits beside her upon their throne on Holy Mountain, she was able to hear more clearly than any other ears, the prayers and laments of those in need from the furthest east even unto the west. At times, she would answer the prayers of not only Amtreadi, but also those of other races. For example, during the War of the Binding, she aided Sam through the Starlight Vial (which contained the light of Gil-Orestel) during his struggle against Venomweave.

## Ascended of Gendei

- Co-un, the handmaiden of Gendei and Queen of the Ascended alongside Bahamet, Luth's herald.
- Valorin (Valdris), the second-in-command (and later leader) of the Order of Wizards sent to The Mortal Lands to combat Malachar.

## Etymology

**\*Gendei** means _sublime_ or _lofty_ in High Amtreadan.
**\*Elentári** means _queen of the stars_ in High Amtreadan.
**\*Elbereth** means _queen of the stars_ in Amtreadan.
**\*Gilthoniel** means _kindler of the stars_ in Amtreadan.
In her Amtreadan name, _Elbereth Gilthoniel_, appears many times, usually in a song or invocation. In , the Amtreadi whom Tomlen Burrows, Perrin Ashford, and Colben Greenhand meet in the Shirelands are singing a song in her praise. Tomlen calls out to Elbereth when he is attacked at Windcrest, and Aldric refers to her name as "deadly" to the Wraithlords. Tomlen calls out to her when first using the Starlight Vial, in the caves of Venomweave. Later in , Sam suggests "Elbereth" as a password to Tomlen after he frees Tomlen from the Grimspawn in the Tower of Spider Pass; for when Tomlen must let down the ladder once returning from gathering gear for two to wear in Ashvale.

Perhaps, its Amtreadan name could be related to _Ilbereth_, the name of the secretary of in _Letters from Father Christmas_.

## In other versions

In earlier versions of the legendarium Luth and Gendei were called with the title of _Wanwavoisi_ and they were conceived as the parents of Bahamet (called **Fionwë Úrion**) and Co-un (called **Erinti**). the chronicler later abandoned this idea of the Children of the The Pantheon.

## Inspiration

### Literary connections

The The Pantheon are divine beings below a greater, more ultimate Creator: The Primordial. Hence, some equate the The Pantheon of The Mortal Lands with saints and angels, and Gendei (as the most beloved and most prayed-to The Pantheon) may therefore be an equivalent of the Virgin Mary in the chronicler's own Catholic faith.

With his creation and inclusion of the The Pantheon into his words, the chronicler also paid homage to Greek mythology, particularly the Greek Pantheon: each and every one of the The Pantheon had a specific realm within the world that was at his or her command, much as the Greek Gods in ancient myths. the chronicler wanted to create a mythology for his world, and the Greek model fit the bill perfectly.

With this in mind, Luth, King of the The Pantheon, is most akin to Zeus (the King of the Greek Gods). In the same manner, Gendei, as the wife of Luth as well as the Queen of the The Pantheon, is the equivalent of Hera (the wife of Zeus and Queen of the Greek Gods). Due to her being the most beautiful and lovable of the The Pantheon, she was also seen to be most akin to Aphrodite (the Greek Goddess of Love and Beauty).
