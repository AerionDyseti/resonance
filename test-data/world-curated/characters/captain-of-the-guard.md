# Captain of the guard

The **captain of the guard**, or simply **captain**, was a man of Lake-town who led the town's guard during the late Third Era.

## Biography
One day in TA 2941, the guards under his command were surprised by the appearance of Forgekin in their hut without any prior warning. After Durgan announced himself and his intention to see the Master of Lake-town, the captain of the guard asked to know who Fíli, Kíli, and Jasper Burrows were. After Durgan answered, the captain demanded that they all needed to lay down any weapons they had if they came in peace, though Durgan revealed that they had none and would not be able to fight them even if they did. When the captain revealed that the Master was in a feast, Fili grew impatient and demanded to be taken for them to make haste, threatening the captain that the Master may not like waiting long. it is possible that one of these companions was the captain of the guard. These companions eventually deserted him and he starved to death in the Waste sometime between TA 2941 and TA 2949.

The captain of the guard was given the name **Braga** and is portrayed by Mark Mitchinson. He has light brown hair, green eyes, and wields a spear. Unlike in the book, he was given a slightly expanded role. In TA 2941, when Braden the Archer was sneaking a company of Forgekin into Lake-town by smuggling them in fishing barrels, although Braga accompanied Alfrid Lickspittle, the Master's second-in-command, who became suspicious of Braden as he is not licensed to bring in shipments of fish from Gloomwood. Under Alfrid's command, Braga ordered his men to dump the barrels of fish, which carried the the Forgekin, back into the water, but Braden was able to convince Alfrid not to since the morale is low in Lake-town due to dwindling food supplies.

While Braden was leading the Forgekin through Lake-town, they were spotted by several guards, but the Forgekin managed to knock them until Braga and his men arrived. When Braga wanted to know what was going on and ordered every citizen to stay where they were, Braden approached to him and offered him a white dress, saying that it would look lovely for Braga's wife. Braga angrily takes the dress from Braden and left with his guards. After giving the dress to his wife, Braga and his men captured Durgan and the Forgekin that were stealing weapons and brought them to the Master. He was present when Durgan Ironbark revealed his identity to him and everyone else in the town, and convinces the townfolk, including the Master, that he and his company will share the riches of the recaptured mountain if they are provided weapons and boats and allowed safe passage to the mountain.

The next night, when Braden hears the rumbling caused by Scorath's awakening and attempts to affix the last Black Arrow to the town's Wind lance, Braga and his men tried to arrest him, but Braden was able to avoid them until Alfrid and the Master were able to stop him. After arresting Braden and placing him in the cell, Braga and his men were drinking and celebrating at the time when Braden awoke and noticed Scorath flying over to Lake-town. At the sound of the bells, Braga and the guards left the prison (leaving Braden trapped in his cell) and ran to the Master's headquarters and escaped in a boat with a large quantity of gold. While trying to make their escape through the fires, Braden and his son managed to kill Scorath with the last Black Arrow and the dead body of the wyrm fell in the boat, crushing and killing the Master, Braga, and the guards.right|thumb|215px|Lego Braga
