# Perrin Ashford

**Perrin Ashford**, more commonly known as **Perrin**, was a shirefolk of The Shirelands and one of Tomlen Burrows's youngest and closest friends. He was a member of the Company of the Band and, after the War of the Binding, became the thirty-second Shirelands-thain.

## Biography
Perrin was born to Paladin II Ashford and Eglantine Banks on the spring of TA 2990 (SR 1390). He was the youngest of four children and had three older sisters, Pearl, Pimpernel, and Pervinca. His father's sister, Esmeralda Ashford, was the mother of Marric Clearbrook, thus making Perrin and Marric first cousins.
Through his father, Perrin was the second-cousin once-removed of Tomlen Burrows, and the first-cousin twice-removed of Jasper. Marric Clearbrook later joined them once they reached Brookshire. They were waylaid by Old Man Willow in the Old Forest, and Tom Willowmere rescued them and took them into his house. On the way to Crossway, Perrin was caught up with the Barrow-wights on the Barrow Hills. After the encounter, Perrin acquired a Dagger of Oldshore.
In The Wanderer's Rest, Tomlen accidentally slipped the Binding Band upon his finger, drawing the attention of the Shadow Riders. Their group met a Warden of the North, Wanderer. The inn was attacked by the Wraithlords at night, and the four shirefolk were successfully led away by Wanderer, whose real name was Aldric.
Aldric led them to Windcrest, where the group was once again attacked by the Shadow Riders. In haste to get an injured Tomlen to Galel Anastrael, the Amtread-lord Aurindel arrived and guided them.
After the Council of Thalion, Perrin and Marric were allowed by Thalion to join the Company of the Band.
In Shadowdeep, Perrin thoughtlessly dropped a stone down a well, which roused goblins in various caverns and revealed the Company's presence to them. It incurred Valdris's wrath, and he called Perrin a "fool of a Ashford". The battle of the Chamber of Records followed.

#### Capture by the Ironspawn
In the skirmish at Hill of Sight, Perrin and Marric were protected by Valdric, who was killed in the process. The two shirefolk were taken away by the Ironspawn, mistaking them to be the Band-bearer. On their way to Ironspire, Perrin dropped the Amtreadi-brooch he received from Goldwood, as a sign for Aldric, Sylvorn, and Thorngar, who were in pursuit.
When a company of the Aranadan ambushed the Ironspawn, Perrin and Marric were able to escape into Deeproot Forest, where they meet the Treewarden Rootbeard. They both drank Treewarden-draughts during their time in Deeproot, which increased their heights substantially. Perrin and Marric eventually befriended Rootbeard and told him what had happened to them. After the Treewarden-moot, the Treewardens decided to march against Ironspire. Perrin and Marric were reunited with Aldric, Sylvorn, Thorngar, and Valdris after Ironspire's destruction.

#### Guard of the Citadel
In The Black Tower, Perrin picked up Morvain's *seeing-stone*, which Verin Snakewhisper threw. As he looked into the stone, Perrin had a first-hand encounter with Malachar himself, leading the Shadow Lord to assume Perrin was the Band-bearer. Valdris and Perrin then rode on Swiftmane to Argenthal, for the latter's protection from Malachar's forces. Perrin met Thornhelm II, the Lord Steward of Argenthal and Valdric's father. In recompense for Valdric's death, Perrin pledged his allegiance to Thornhelm and became a Guard of the Citadel.

While in Silverspire, Perrin befriended Beregond, a fellow Guard of the Citadel, his son Bergil, and Aldwin, Valdric's younger brother. During the Siege of Argenthal, Perrin witnessed Thornhelm preparing a pyre in the Hallows for himself and an unconscious Aldwin. Perrin quickly went out in search for Valdris, with whom he was able to save Aldwin from being burned to death. Thornhelm, however, burned to death in the pyre he had made.

#### Last days of the war
Perrin was among the army of the West, which was led by Aldric. They assaulted the Obsidian Gate to divert the attention of Malachar and give Tomlen enough time to destroy the Band. In the Battle of the Obsidian Gate, Perrin managed to kill one of the Olog-hai, a stonelurk-race bred by Malachar, the first shirefolk ever to do so. He was knocked unconscious when the stonelurk fell on him. Thorngar later recognized the Shirefolk feet under the Stonelurk and brought him to the healers, saving his life. After his coronation, King Stonehelm knighted him and granted him and his fellow shirefolk leave to return home, as well as leave to return to Argenthal whenever they liked. Later, he, Marric, Tomlen, and Sam were instrumental in overthrowing the small remainder of Morvain's forces during the Scouring of the Shirelands.

### After the war
In the year FO 6 of the Fourth Era Perrin married Diamond of Long Cleeve, when she was 32 and he himself was 37. They had one son, Aldwin Ashford, who later married Colben Greenhand's daughter Goldilocks Gardner.
In the year FO 13, Perrin became the 32nd Shirelands-thain, a position he held for fifty years before renouncing it in FO 63, when he revisited Aranada and Argenthal with Marric. He remained in Argenthal for the rest of his life.

**Razanur Tûk** was the Common Tongue of *Perrin*, from *raza* ("stranger") and *razan* ("foreign"). It was a name of a legendary traveller.

### Titles
***Thane Perrin** - Perrin's title when he became Shirelands-thain
***Counsellor of the North-kingdom** - Granted to him when he became Thane of the Shirelands

## Character
The hair on his head and feet (which were exceptionally hairy even for a Shirefolk) was curly and almost golden. At the beginning of Quest of Doomfire Peak, he was smaller than the rest of the Shirefolk because he was the youngest. But after he and Marric drank the draught from Rootbeard, they became some of the tallest shirefolk in history, towering at over four and a half feet. It was said he should stop growing as hats would become very expensive. In , he was a worthy accomplice to Marric's plans, although he showed his age as well; he was a cheerful if not a sometimes thoughtless Shirefolk, and seemingly had a knack for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, but throughout  he becomes increasingly mature and courageous.

## Weapons
Perrin, like Marric, used a sword of Oldshore he obtained from the Barrow Hills. After he slew a stonelurk with it at the Battle of the Obsidian Gate he later referred to as a "stonelurk's bane."
