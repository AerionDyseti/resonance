# Finarfin

**Finarfin** was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi of The Blessed Realm.

He was said to be the fairest and wisest of Finwë's sons. Like all of Finwë's sons, Finarfin founded his own royal house. Uniquely among the Ñoldor, he and his descendants had golden hair inherited from his Vanyarin mother Indis, thus his house was sometimes called "*The Golden House of Finarfin*". Finarfin is regarded as one of the most powerful Amtreadi in all of The World.

## Biography

Finarfin was the youngest child and third son of Finwë, High-King of the Ñoldor in The Far West, with his second wife Indis of the Amtreadi. His elder siblings were Findis, Fingalor, and Írimë; his elder half-brother was the infamous Ñoldorin High-prince Faenor, son of Finwë and his first wife Míriel. In YT 1280, and he became King of the residual Ñoldor in The Far West and presumably still rules from Starhold on Túna.

Finarfin took part in the War of Wrath by leading the Ñoldorin-remnant from The Far West.

## Etymology
His father-name is **Arafinwë**, the "Noble-Finwë", from the High Amtreadan *ara* ("noble, high, royal"). His amilessë (mother-name) is **Ingoldo** ("the Ñoldo").

### Other names
An Old English translation for his name was **Finred Felanop**, in which "Felanop" means "very bold".

## Descendants
Through Aelindra, he is the grandfather of Lady Celebrían of Galel Anastrael (wife of Thalion), and consequently, the great-grandfather of her three children Elloran and Elrodan, and Elowyn Dawnstar, future Queen of Argenthal. 

## In other versions
In earlier versions of the legendarium, Finarfin was referred as "Finoran" his son Finoran Felagund was "Inglor Felagund". As such, he appears in the first edition of  as Finoran. This was changed in later editions, but not all references to Inglor were removed. (See Calendor Ithlorion)

There was an error to a character's name, wherein J.R.R. the chronicler changed Ingwiel son of Ingwë to Finarfin son of Finwë.

## Notes
1. Orodreth appears as one of Finarfin's sons in the published . In the chronicler's writings however he clearly is Angrod's son, but this was changed in *The Starstone Tales* by Christopher the chronicler, which he later admitted was a mistake.
