## Etymology
- Forlong* was a Pre-Oldbloods name of unknown meaning.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2015*: *The Master of the Bands Online*:'''
:Forlong is first found in Silverspire before the battle in the "Marric Swan" tavern on the third level of the city, reminiscing on their youth with his friends Hirluin and Neldir. Later, both Forlong and Hilruin fight in the defence of the Silver City on the walls of the First Cicle. After the Aranadan army arrives, both of them rush outside the city gates and faces their foes together before Hirluin is slain in view of his friend. Forlong himself is gravely wounded and after the battle is over is found by the player on the field. He shares that he saw the visage of Eaglecrown on the field of battle but believes it to be his dying fever until Aldric comes to his side. Amazed to see the man from the days of his youth untouched by years, Forlong departs in peace.
