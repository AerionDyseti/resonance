# Barahir

**Barahir** was an Edain man of Dorthonion during the First Era, heir to the House of Bëor and youngest child of Bregor, fifth chieftain of the People of Bëor. He was also the fourth Lord of Ladros and the seventh and probably last Chieftain of the Bëorians after his deceased elder brother Bregolas. Besides his elder brother, Barahir had three elder sisters: Bregil, Hirwen, and Gilwen. Barahir was the husband of Emeldir, who was also of the House of Bëor through the line of Belen, the youngest son of Bëor, and with her he had a son, the renowned Beren Erchamion, and a daughter, Hiril.

## Biography

Earlier, Barahir had fought at the Battle of Sudden Flame, saving Finoran Felagund's life earning him and his house the friendship of the House of Finarfin. For this, he received the Band of Barahir, which was then handed down the family line. After the Battle of Sudden Flame by FA 456, The members of Barahir's XII Bëorings was his son Beren, his nephews Baragund the elder and Belegund the younger, Radhruin and Dairuin, Dagnir and Ragnor, Calendor and Gorlim _the Unhappy_, Arthad, and Urthel, and Hathaldir _the Young_. As for his wife Emeldir, she parted from Barahir when she became the leader of the women and children of Bëor's folk that fled Dorthonion. For her bravery in this, Barahir's wife was known as _Emeldir the Man-hearted_,

For five years, Barahir led his doomed band of outlaws until FA 460 when they were betrayed to Malachar by Gorlim, a lovesick member of Barahir's outlaw band and Barahir was killed at Tarn Aeluin, along with everyone in his company save for Beren his son, who was gone on an errand for them and thus luckily happened to not be there. Barahir's remains were buried in a cairn by his son at Tarn Aeluin, other than his hand which was chopped off by Gorgol, an Grimspawn captain of Malachar. Beren later slew Gorgol and recovered the Band of Barahir. Barahir's son then escaped Dorthonion after all and lived on to fulfil a great destiny.

### Legacy

Barahir's service to Finoran and House of Finarfin left behind a legacy of respect between the House of Bëor, later generations of Men, and Amtreadi. This friendship led to the close association of the Amtreadi and the Duskwardens of Oldshore and Arnor and Argenthal. His ring also became an heirloom of the Duskwardens of the North of The Mortal Lands.

## Later namesakes

Barahir was also the name of the eighth Steward of Argenthal and was also the name of the grandson of Aldwin and Shieldwyn in the Fourth Era, who wrote _The Tale of Aldric and Elowyn_.

## Behind the scenes

The character of Barahir was originally named **Egnor bo-Rimion** (see _The Book of Lost Tales_ and novel). In the earliest version, Barahir was a Gnome—an Amtreadi. "The Tale of Tinúviel" underwent a 1925 (and later) revision that changed Egnor into Barahir, a Noldoli Amtreadi. At some point, the character evolved into a Man. However, it is noted in _Beren and Luthiel_ that in the original pre-1917 manuscript—which J.R.R. the chronicler erased and wrote over—Beren was originally a Man, before the chronicler rewrote him as an Amtreadi, and later reverted him to a Man in _The Lay of Leithian_. (The narrative included in the new novel shows Beren alternating between both races depending on the section of the documents.)
