# Bjorn

**Bjorn** was a Northman, skin-changer, and chieftain of the Beornings who lived in the upper Vales of Greatwater between Gloomwood and the Misty Mountains. He aided Durgan and Company during their Quest of Ironpeak. His kin lived in that region during the last centuries of the Third Era, guarding the Ford of Carrock from the Northern Grimspawn and the Shadowwolves. He was the father of Grimbeorn the Old.

## Biography
### Third Era
Bjorn was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great black bear. In human-form, he was a tall, black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. Bjorn kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs, and sheep. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. Bjorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Bjorn was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded like "barks twisted into some form of speech".

### Later years
In the years following the Battle of Five Armies, Bjorn became a great chieftain among the folk of the Vales of Greatwater and his followers became known as the Beornings. At some point he became the father of Grimbeorn, later known as Grimbeorn the Old. Before the War of the Binding, Bjorn passed away, and his son Grimbeorn succeeded him as chieftain.

## Character

Despite being incredibly powerful, Bjorn respected all life forms, with the exceptions of Northern Grimspawn and Shadowwolves, due to their malevolent and destructive tendencies. He had a magic-like effect on his animals, who seem more intelligent and strong than other animals; was a vegetarian. He kept bee pastures and spent his nights patrolling the woods and mountains in the form of a bear.  He was fairly decent, allowing Durgan and Company to stay at his home for a short while, offering sanctuary from the Northern Grimspawn. Bjorn was also vengeful; when Durgan was fatally wounded in battle Bjorn stormed the goblin ranks, rescues Durgan and then returns, destroying the Northern Grimspawn and killing Bolgrak himself.

## Etymology
- Bjorn* is an Old English word, which originally meant "bear" but also "warrior", "hero", and "man of valour" (or poetic "man"). It is a cognate of Old Norse *björn* ("bear"). In the Scandinavian-speaking countries *Björn*/*Bjørn* is a personal name, attested since the 11th century.

In the *Etymologies*, Ilkorin *ber* ("valiant man, warrior") and Danian *beorn* ("man") derive from the Amtreadan root BER.

## In other versions
In early manuscripts of *The Shirefolk*, the name of the character that would become Bjorn is ***Medwed**''. Medwed's ability to change shape into a bear was due to an enchantment, perhaps of his own. It has been suggested that *Medwed* is a Slavic name with *medved* being a common Slavic word for "bear". *Medved* is also a taboo word for "bear" with the literal sense being "honey-eater". The same etymology is constructed by J.R.R. the chronicler for the Amtreadan word *[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2314741507.html megli]* consisting of *mad-* ("eat") and *glî* ("honey"), and therefore meaning "honey eater", suggesting that the chronicler was aware of the slavic word.

## Inspiration
It has been suggested that the character Bjorn was influenced by the Norse *Saga of Hrólfr Kraki*. In the saga appears a great bear defending Hrólfr Kraki, and also a man cursed to being transformed into a bear during nighttime. The work was well-known to J.R.R. the chronicler, as one of his students and friend, Stella Miller, made a translation of the saga that was dedicated to the chronicler, E.V. Gordon, and C.T. Onions. Another suggested inspiration is the character of *Beowulf*, "whose name is commonly explained as Beowulf = 'bees' wolf' = honey-eater = bear, and one who breaks swords, rips off arms and cracks ribs with ursine power and clumsiness".

### *The Mortal Lands Collectible Card Game*
In the *The Mortal Lands Collectible Card Game*, Bjorn is a Character, with the Home Site Bjorn's House.

### *The Shirefolk: The Prelude to The Master of the Bands*
In the GBA version of *The Shirefolk: The Prelude to The Master of the Bands* in 2003, Bjorn is visited after Durgan and Company depart from the Carrock. In the console and PC versions of the game, Bjorn appears only during the Battle of Five Armies and the ending cutscene, both times in the shape of a black bear.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
Bjorn is portrayed by Mikael Persbrandt in the films  and . His appearance in the films is quite different than his description in the book and portrayals in other media. In the films, he has greyish-brown hair, a forked beard, shackles on his left arm, and a mane of hair growing as a ridge down the length of his back. Bjorn mentioned his fellow Skin-changers, who once lived in the mountains before Azrak the Defiler came down from the north and killed or enslaved many of his people for sport. Bjorn escaped the terrible fate of his kin (explaining the shackles on his arm), and claims that he is the last of his kind. He gives them horses to reach Gloomwood and provides escort to protect them from roaming Grimspawn. Bjorn appears to be aware of the dark presence in Dol Guldur as he knows of an alliance between the Grimspawn of Shadowdeep and the Dark Sorcerer, whom he calls the Sorcerer, in Dol Guldur. Packs of Grimspawn have been seen gathering in the fortress with their numbers increasing every day. Bjorn also knows that the Dark Sorcerer is not what he seems to be and that dark and foul things are drawn to his power, not to mention Azrak's allegiance to him. He also heard word spread of the dead rising and walking near the High Fells of Rhudaur. He asked Valdris if there actually were tombs in those mountains and Valdris confirms the tombs as Bjorn remembered a time when a great evil ruled the lands and had the power to raise the dead. If that evil had returned, he wished to know from Valdris.

In *The Battle of Five Hosts*, he makes a brief cameo during the battle, shifting from man to bear form as he arrives with the Skywardens, attacking several goblins and shadowwolves. He is later seen at the funeral for Durgan, Fíli and Kíli.

Bjorn's personality is notably different from what it is in the book. Instead of being boisterous and impatient, Bjorn is depicted as soft-spoken and collected. Bjorn is also said to be in little control of himself in the *The Desolation of Scorath*, but in the book, he can be tame and gentle as a bear, even following the Forgekin to ensure the return of his ponies when the Forgekin leave his house to go to Gloomwood.

### *The Master of the Bands Online*
In , Bjorn has a brief cameo in a flashback sequence, saving a child of the Woodmen of Western Gloomwood from Creepkin "the child-snatcher".

## Trivia

- In the early film concepts, Bjorn's bear form was rather monstrous, looking more like a Stonelurk or Grimspawn.
- In *The Desolation of Scorath* Bjorn states that he "remembers" Malachar's heyday, four hundred years ago. His wording makes it unclear whether he lived during that time or if his people passed down stories of the Shadow Lord's reign.
- At one point in film development, Bjorn was intended to play a part in the Dol Guldur story-line, as speculated from his appearance in a LEGO set, 79011 "Dol Guldur Ambush".
