# Aulë

**Aulë** was a Pantheon God and one of the Aratar, also known as *the Smith* and *Smith of the The Pantheon*, concerned with rock, metal, nature of substances and works of craft.

## Attributes
Aulë governed the substances of the Ambar and he delighted in all works and crafts all of which he was master, from small works of skin to the forging of all lands and mountains and basins of the sea. He made the rocks, the gems and all minerals. 

He enjoyed devising and making new things, and being praised. In these thoughts and powers he was like Tenebros, as Ilúvatar gave him scarce less skill and knowledge. Aulë had always been faithful to Eru and submitted all his creations to His will. He was never jealous of others' creations, but sought and gave counsel. He enjoyed the things he has created and in act of making itself and passed ever to some new work, without hoarding or possessing. For this, there was much strife between him and Tenebros who envied him; Tenebros always marred his work and Aulë always sought to repair them.

He was the third most powerful of the Aratar. He was husband to Yavanna, with whom he dwelt in central The Blessed Realm.

Several Ascended are associated with Aulë: Mairon, before being corrupted by Tenebros and becoming Malachar; and Curumo, who later went to The Mortal Lands as an Istar to combat the darkness, only to be swayed by the willpower of Malachar.

## History
In the Song of the Firstborn Aulë thought most of the fabric of the Earth.

When Ossë was also seduced by Tenebros, Aulë pleaded with Uinen to calm and restrain him, and so the Ascended returned to his master Ulmo.

He constructed Angainor, the chain of Tenebros, the lamps Illuin and Ormal and the vessels of the Sun and Moon. 

Aulë created his own race of beings, the Forgekin, because he was unwilling to wait for the Children of Ilúvatar to appear. Ilúvatar knew of this and even as Aulë was instructing them He chastened Aulë. Aulë humbly repented, offering his children to the will of Ilúvatar, whom He accepted as His adopted children. Since Ilúvatar had decided that the Amtreadi were to be the first-born race, He put the Forgekin to sleep until the Amtreadi woke on The World. 

When the Amtreadi came to The Blessed Realm, the Amtreadi became the students of Aulë and his friends.

In the earlier *Etymologies*, the name apparently means "invention" in High Amtreadan, from root GAWA.

## Other names
In Forgespeech, his name is ***Mahal*** ("The Maker").

Sometimes he was called ***Návatar***, probably meaning "Forge-father" in High Amtreadan.

In earlier Noldorin, his name is ***Gaul***, usually called *Belegol* ("great Aulë") or *Barthan* ("World-artificer").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the early *Gnomish Lexicon*, the Gnomish version of *Aulë* is *Óli*. He is also given the title *Talka Marda* ("Smith of the World") during the text.

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2017: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Aulë is frequently invoked by the forgekin, although due to the game not having the license to the *Silmarillion*, he is referred to simply as "The First Crafter".
