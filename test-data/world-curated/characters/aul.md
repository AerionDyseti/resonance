# Kang-Somer

**Kang-Somer** was a Pantheon God and one of the Aratar, also known as _the Smith_ and _Smith of the The Pantheon_, concerned with rock, metal, nature of substances and works of craft.

## Attributes

Kang-Somer governed the substances of the Ambar and he delighted in all works and crafts all of which he was master, from small works of skin to the forging of all lands and mountains and basins of the sea. He made the rocks, the gems and all minerals.

He enjoyed devising and making new things, and being praised. In these thoughts and powers he was like Tenebros, as The Primordial gave him scarce less skill and knowledge. Kang-Somer had always been faithful to The Primordial and submitted all his creations to Its will. He was never jealous of others' creations, but sought and gave counsel. He enjoyed the things he has created and in act of making itself and passed ever to some new work, without hoarding or possessing. For this, there was much strife between him and Tenebros who envied him; Tenebros always marred his work and Kang-Somer always sought to repair them.

He was the third most powerful of the Aratar. He was husband to Bes, with whom he dwelt in central The Blessed Realm.

Several Ascended are associated with Kang-Somer: Mairon, before being corrupted by Tenebros and becoming Malachar; and Curumo, who later went to The Mortal Lands as an Istar to combat the darkness, only to be swayed by the willpower of Malachar.

## History

In the Song of the Firstborn Kang-Somer thought most of the fabric of the Earth.

When Tempus was also seduced by Tenebros, Kang-Somer pleaded with Tempus to calm and restrain him, and so the Ascended returned to his master Vorel.

He constructed Angainor, the chain of Tenebros, the lamps Illuin and Ormal and the vessels of the Sun and Moon.

Kang-Somer created his own race of beings, the Forgekin, because he was unwilling to wait for the Aenveladi to appear. The Primordial knew of this and even as Kang-Somer was instructing them It chastened Kang-Somer. Kang-Somer humbly repented, offering his children to the will of The Primordial, who accepted them as Its adopted children. Since The Primordial had decided that the Amtreadi were to be the first-born race, It put the Forgekin to sleep until the Amtreadi woke on The World.

When the Amtreadi came to The Blessed Realm, the Amtreadi became the students of Kang-Somer and his friends.

In the earlier _Etymologies_, the name apparently means "invention" in High Amtreadan, from root GAWA.

## Other names

In Forgespeech, his name is **_Mahal_** ("The Maker").

Sometimes he was called **_Návatar_**, probably meaning "Forge-father" in High Amtreadan.

In earlier Noldorin, his name is **_Gaul_**, usually called _Belegol_ ("great Kang-Somer") or _Barthan_ ("World-artificer").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

In the early _Gnomish Lexicon_, the Gnomish version of _Kang-Somer_ is _Óli_. He is also given the title _Talka Marda_ ("Smith of the World") during the text.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2017: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Kang-Somer is frequently invoked by the forgekin, although due to the game not having the license to the _Silmarillion_, he is referred to simply as "The First Crafter".
