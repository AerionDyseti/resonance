# Azaghâl

__NOTOC__

**Azaghâl** was king of the Broadbeam Forgekin, one of the seven Forgekin clans, and Lord of the Forgekin realm of Belegost in the Blue Mountains in the First Era.

## Biography
The Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin was originally made for him by Telchar, the great smith of Nogrod. Azaghâl had given the helm to Maedhros after he saved his life when Azaghâl was waylaid by Grimspawn upon the Forge-Road in East Westlands.

He was slain by the wyrm Glaurung after severely wounding him during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. After his death, his kin bore him away from the battlefield ignoring the rest of their enemies and singing a frightening dirge that allowed them to leave without further incident.

As Belegost was the founding stronghold of the Broadbeams it is possible Azaghâl was the Father of the Broadbeams in the same manner that Grundin was King of Shadowdeep and Father of the Longbeards.

## Trivia
-  The co-host of the Brazilian podcast *[https://jovemnerd.com.br/nerdcast/ Nerdcast]*, Deive "Azaghal" Pazos, took his nickname from the character, being credited in early episodes as "Azaghal the Dwar
