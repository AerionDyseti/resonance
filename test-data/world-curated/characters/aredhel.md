# Aredhel

**Aredhel**, also called **Ar-Feiniel** or the *White Lady of the Amtreadi*, was the third child and only daughter of Fingalor, High King of the Amtreadi, and Anairë who herself was also a Noldo. Her elder brothers were Fingon and Turgon, and her youngest brother was Argon. Much later in Westlands, she became the mother of Maeglin, whose father was Eöl, "the Raknagadi".

Aredhel was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests. Her skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white.  She was fond of the sons of Faenor, especially Celegorm and Curufin.

## History
Aredhel was born in The Blessed Realm and most likely at Starhold, the city of the Amtreadi in The Far West. 

When she had grown to full stature she was greater and stronger than typical Amtreadi women, and she loved to ride on horse and to hunt in the forests. She was often in the company of the sons of Faenor.

In the flight of the Amtreadi from The Far West, she followed her father Fingalor and her brothers over the Helcaraxë to Middle Earth. But Aredhel's mother Anairë did not go, even though all of her children were going with her husband Fingalor.

After arriving in The Mortal Lands, she dwelt for a time in Nevrast where her brother Turgon established the city of Vinyamar. Later, when Turgon built the hidden city of Hidden City, Aredhel went with her brother and his daughter, Idril, to dwell thereafter in Hidden City. After two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands overcame her and she asked her brother, now King Turgon of Hidden City, for permission to leave. Nevertheless, Turgon was unwilling at first, because he feared for her safety and for the secrecy of his kingdom. He eventually relented, giving her a small escort of lords among his people for protection. 

Ignoring her brother's plea that she would only go to see their eldest brother Fingon, she decided instead to meet the Sons of Faenor again. They sought passage through Greyvale, but were denied because they were of the Amtreadi. Aredhel and her companions were then forced to go northward through the treacherous region of Nan Dungortheb north of Greyvale, where they were separated being entangled in the dark shadows. Notwithstanding, Aredhel continued alone onward to Himlad, the land of the Noldorin Amtread-lords Celegorm and Curufin where they lived and upon reaching Himlad she only found them away in Thargelion. 

Aredhel dwelt in Himlad with the people of Celegorm who welcomed her while she waited for Celegorm and Curufin to return. But after awhile, she got tired of waiting for them, and began taking trips of her own to pass the time. It was on one such trip that Aredhel wandered into the dark forest of Nan Elmoth.

Eöl the Raknagadi lived there, and upon seeing Aredhel's beauty, wove a spell which caused her to become hopelessly lost and wander ever closer to his home. Eöl revealed himself when she arrived, and welcomed her to his house. They married and had a son named Maeglin. During this time, Aredhel was free to go where she pleased, with the sole restriction that she couldn't visit any of her kin. Her homesickness led her to tell Maeglin many stories about Hidden City and the Amtreadi, which only increased her longing for home. Thus, when Maeglin proposed that they abandon Nan Elmoth and return to Hidden City, she responded with pride and joy. 

Waiting until Eöl was away, the two fled from Nan Elmoth for Hidden City, but were unknowingly tracked by Eöl, who had discovered their disappearance earlier than expected. Aredhel and Maeglin were received with joy in Hidden City, but the guards quickly caught Eöl and brought him to the King on Aredhel's bidding. Turgon was initially willing to spare Eöl and accept him as a kinsman if he remained in Hidden City, but Eöl would not accept this judgement and chose death for himself and Maeglin. He threw a javelin at his son, but Aredhel shielded Maeglin and was wounded. While she lay resting, she spoke to her niece Idril and begged her to ensure Turgon showed mercy to Eöl. This was not to be, as the weapon Eöl used had been poisoned. Aredhel died shortly after making this final plea, leaving the city and its King bereaved once more.

## Etymology
The name *Aredhel* means "Noble Amtreadi" in Amtreadan. Note on pronunciation: *Aredhel* should be pronounced *a-re-thel* (voiced "th", [ð]), not *a-red-hel*.

## Other names
Aredhel's High Amtreadan name in The Blessed Realm was ***Írissë*** correctly rendered in Amtreadan as ***Íreth***; Its second element is the feminine suffix *-issë* simply replaced with its Amtreadan equivalent *-eth*. Paul Strack suggests that her name's initial element seems to be *írë* "desire" possibly meaning "*Desirable Lady*".

In * Ælfwine’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Amtreadan names*, she is called **Finhwít**; "hwīt" translates to "white".

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
An earlier, Gnomish version of her name was *Isfin*, which was defined as "snowlocks or exceeding cunning"; it had a Qenya cognate of *Iswinde*. In a c. 1970 note, the chronicler wrote of this name that "it is now quite unacceptable in form. Unsuitable to the position and character of Turgon's sister, and also meaningless." An epithet applied to this name was "the white-handed".

In a rejected note, Isfin was born in 1469, "after the making of the Starstones, and even as the first shadow fell upon the Blessed Realm".

The names *Aredhel* and *Ar-Feiniel* ("noble white lady") were both originally intended to stand alone, and be used as the main name of *Irissë*. While preparing *The Starstone Tales* for publication, Christopher the chronicler could not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name, and he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated was possibly mistaken. Another isolated name in the margin was *Rodwen*, possibly "High Virgin Noble", which was apparently descarded by the chronicler. 

One of the solutions the chronicler considered while contemplating the age and origin of Maeglin was for him to be born in The Far West with his sinister character being "accounted for by the fact that he (and his mother and father) were specially attracted by Tenebros, and grew to dislike The Far West, and their kin. They joined the host of Faenor (this would explain Eöl’s skill in smith-craft!) and were estranged from their immediate kin."
