# Erellont

**Erellont** was a faithful friend of Aerendil and one of three mariners that accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of The Mortal Lands.

## Biography

Like Aerendil's other two companions, Erellont's origins were not known; he probably lived in Arvernien in the Havens of Sirion with other exiles from the friendly realms.

When Aerendil was resolved to sail to The Far West to plea for help from the The Pantheon, Erellont (along with Aerandir and Falathar) went with him. When they reached the shores of the Blessed Realm, he and the others remained aboard while Aerendil sought the The Pantheon. After Aerendil's embassy was complete, Bahamet, the herald of Luth, came to him and the others and set them upon another ship. Luth then set a great wind to blow them east back to The Mortal Lands.

His fate afterwards is unknown.
