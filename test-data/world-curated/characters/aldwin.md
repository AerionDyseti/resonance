# Aldwin

**Aldwin** was the last Lord Steward of Argenthal and the first Prince of Moonvale. 

The second of Thornhelm's two sons, Aldwin was briefly the Lord Steward after his father's death. Upon the arrival of the true king, King Aldric Stonehelm, he laid down his office, but Stonehelm renewed the hereditary appointment of Steward as the advisor to the King. Aldwin was also appointed Prince of Moonvale.

## History
Aldwin was born in , five years after Valdric. Aldwin was five when his mother Finduilas died. When that happened, Valdric and Aldwin formed a great bond with each other. 
left|thumb|*Brothers study* by Catherine Chmiel
He grew to become a brave warrior admired by his soldiers, although unlike his brother, he did not care much for battle and arms and needless danger. He gained from the wisdom of Valdris who visited Silverspire, and loved lore and music; his gentle nature (and love of Valdris) displeased his father. Although Thornhelm grew cold and grim and favoured Valdric over him, there was no rivalry between the brothers; Valdric was always his helper and protector.

Twice Aldwin had a prophetic dream and didn't speak about it, until he saw it again with his brother. The following day saw Malachar's attack on Starbridge which started the War of the Binding. The two brothers commanded the defences of Starbridge. They protected the last bridge across the Greatwater until it was destroyed. Only the two brothers and two others survived by swimming.

Seeking clues for the dream, Valdric set out for Galel Anastrael.

On 1 March, his father sent him for an errand to Moonvale where Aldwin went to command the Wardens of Moonvale.

Aldwin informed Tomlen of Valdric's death, implying Tomlen's involvement in it, though Tomlen had not known of Valdric's death until that very moment. Unsure of how to deal with his captives, Aldwin led Tomlen and Sam, blindfolded, to Hidden Falls. There he questioned them further in private, learning that the shirefolk' errand was linked to the 'Valorian's bane' that had sent Valdric to Galel Anastrael in the first place. Eager to earn their trust Aldwin delivered his famous oath, saying that he "...would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Silverspire falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Shadow Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs". In a slip up however Colben revealed the nature of 'Valorian's bane' and so Aldwin was tested, just as Valdric had been, by the lure of The Band. Where Valdric failed Aldwin succeeded, leading Colben to remark that Aldwin had "shown [his] quality".

During the night, Aldwin's watch spotted Creepkin fishing in the Forbidden Pool. Aldwin called Tomlen to him who confessed to the part of Creepkin in their errand, begging Aldwin not to slay him. Creepkin was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Tomlen. The following morning Aldwin with his men also left the refuge the next day.

Aldwin remained out of action for the rest of the War of the Binding. During the Battle of Silverspire Fields Thornhelm planned to burn his stricken son alongside him and Aldwin was once again saved by Valdris, though Thornhelm completed his suicide. After this he was taken to the Houses of Healing and healed by Aldric after the battle. Aldwin spent the rest of the war recovering in the Houses of Healing where he met Éowyn, also grievously wounded. The two fell in love and were married after the war.

### After the War of the Binding
After the destruction of the Binding Band and the Battle of the Obsidian Gate, Aldwin, as Steward, led the ceremony in the crowning of Aldric as King of Argenthal and Arnor.

## Etymology
- Aldwin* is never glossed, and neither is indicated if it is High Amtreadan or Amtreadan.

As all the Kings of Argenthal and their heirs had names in High Amtreadan, and the name is also attested as a name of the royal family (in the case of Aldwin son of Ondoher) the name apparently is High Amtreadan.

## Genealogy

## Inspiration
Aldwin was, in the words of the chronicler, "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful". His appearance toward the end of *The Two Towers* apparently was as much of a surprise to the chronicler as it is to his readers. "I am sure I did not invent him," he wrote. "I did not even want him, though I like him". 

Aldwin in many ways speaks for the chronicler, who was an officer in the British Army during World War I, when he says, for example, "I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness... I love only that which they defend". Much later, the chronicler would write, "As far as any character is 'like me', it is Aldwin".

File:The Master of the Bands Online - Aldwin.jpg|Aldwin in *The Master of the Bands Online*

- '1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):'''
:Aldwin's role has been omitted. However, a young black-haired man is shown at Aldric's coronation, sitting on a horse beside Éowyn. It can be guessed that this is a cameo of Aldwin. Whether he had at any time a larger part, that was cut for time restraints, is unknown.

'*1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):*'
:Aldwin is voiced by Andrew Seear. Because Valdric already named him during the Council of Thalion - in the book, he is simply called "my brother" - much of the mystery surrounding Aldwin's first appearance is lost to the attentive listener. His flight from the Wraithlords across the Silverspire Fields is also omitted. However, unlike some adaptations Aldwin's recovery in the Houses of Healing and his budding romance with Éowyn are included, as is his role at Aldric's coronation.

'*1988: *J.R.R. the chronicler's War in Middle Earth*:**
:Aldwin is portrayed as a blond, bearded man. He can be controlled by the player.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Aldwin is played by Friedhelm Ptok.

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:*'
:David Wenham plays Aldwin in this adaptation. He does not at first let Tomlen, Sam, and Creepkin go, but decides to bring them and the Band to Argenthal. He takes them west to Starbridge, crossing the river Greatwater, and not until the Wraithlords attack the city does he release them. Many fans of the book criticise this change, saying that it seriously damages the character, who is meant to emulate the medieval chivalric code and contrast with Valdric. Peter Jackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Tomlen and Sam, because the episode at Spider Pass was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited is that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show character *development*, which meant that Aldwin had to go through some kind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was necessary for Aldwin to be tempted by the Band because everyone else was tempted, and letting Aldwin be immune would be inconsistent, at least in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films' portrayal of the Band. However, despite these comments, Aldric still resists the Band easily at the end of the first movie, which acts as a contradiction to Jackson's claim.

:In the Extended Edition, Jackson has included a flashback scene showing that Thornhelm has been neglecting him and favouring Valdric, so that Aldwin wanted to please his father by bringing him the Band. The relationship is similarly strained in the books, but there his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Moonvale. On the whole, however, new Extended Edition scenes with Aldwin brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment of the books.

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:*'
:Aldwin's role in this film is largely faithful to that in the book.

'*2002-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Aldwin is provided by Jozef Vajda. The same actor also portrayed Aldwin's brother Valdric earlier in the radio series.

'*2015: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Aldwin's role in the War of the Binding is relatively minor in the game, as by the time the player reaches Silverspire Aldwin has already been wounded and lies in a fever. His first prominent appearance is not until King Stonehelm's coronation. Afterwards, Aldric charges the Steward and the Wardens of Moonvale with cleansing the evil of Specterhold and the Specter Vale. Aldwin leads the Wardens to establish several camps outside the dead city. Eventually he joins Damrod's team inside the walls Specterhold itself, working to combat the evil on the upper levels of the city.
