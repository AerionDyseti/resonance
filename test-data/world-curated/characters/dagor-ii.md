# Dagor II

**Dagor II Ironfoot** (or **King Dagor**), the son of Náin and great-grandson of Dagor I of Grundin Folk. He was a Forgekin King of Grundin Folk, the fifth King under the Mountain, and the Lord of the Iron Hills during the War of the Binding in The Mortal Lands.

## Biography
### War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn
Dagor followed his grandfather, Grór, in lordship after Náin was killed by the great Grimspawn chieftain Azrak during the Battle of Azanulbizar, the final conflict in the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn, before he could inherit the lordship. Almost immediately after the death of Náin, Dagor rushed up the steps and slew Azrak himself with a single blow of his axe, thus avenging his father's death. He was a very young Forgekin at the time, being only thirty-two years of age: by the Forgekin reckoning, he was still a stripling. Dagor's feat was heralded as a magnificent and glorious triumph for one so young. Dagor alone looked past the gate into Shadowdeep, and had the wisdom to know that it was impossible for the Forgekin to return while The Deepflame yet lived.

### The Battle of Five Armies
Dagor was the friend and cousin of Durgan II Ironbark, and responded to Durgan's call for help during the quest to reclaim the Ironpeak. Dagor marched with five hundred Forgekin soldiers, exceptionally strong even by Forgekin standards, clad in heavy chainmail and iron boots, and armed with mattocks, shields, and swords. He arrived just in time for the Battle of Five Armies. With Durgan's death in the battle, Dagor became King of Grundin Folk and King under the Mountain, the first not of the main line. After the battle, Dagor thanked the Skywardens for their timely intervention, crowning their chief with gold and swearing the Forgekin to everlasting friendship with them. He also honored Durgan's commitments to Braden the Archer and Jasper Burrows, giving a fourteenth share of the Mountain's treasure to the people of Lake-town, and promising an even greater share to Jasper, who politely declined to take more than two small chests, filled with silver and gold. Dagor also granted the emeralds of Girion to King Thornael, who prized them greatly.

### The War of the Binding
Dagor was a wise and just leader, and brought much wealth to the mountain realm and was on good terms with the Men of Dale to the south and the Amtreadi king of Northern Gloomwood as well, which ensured peace for many years to come. When Borin and other Forgekin decided to reclaim Shadowdeep, Dagor initially refused, but Borin insisted on going.
A few months before the Council of Thalion, a messenger from Ashvale appeared at the entrance of the Ironpeak and offered the Forgekin an alliance with Malachar, asking only in return that the Forgekin share what they knew "concerning Shirefolk", and help to track down the Binding Band, which the messenger described as "least of rings... a trifle that Malachar fancies."  The messenger said that, if the Forgekin could deliver the Band itself, then Malachar would return three of the Bands of Binding that originally belonged to the Forge-Lords, and Shadowdeep would be theirs to possess forever.  On the other hand, the messenger warned that "things will not seem so well" if the Forgekin did not help.

Knowing from long and bitter experience that Malachar could not be trusted, Dagor refused to be bribed or blackmailed, and sent the messenger away without an answer by claiming that he needed time to think over the proposal. He instead sent Glorin to Galel Anastrael to consult with Thalion, while Dagor prepared the Ironpeak for war.

### Death
Dagor participated in the War of the Binding's northern campaign but was killed during the Battle of Dale in TA 3019, defending the body of King Brand of Dale before the gates of the Ironpeak. He was, by then, an extremely old Forgekin, at the age of two-hundred and fifty-two, but still strong for his age. He was still among the greatest of the Forgekin warriors, a direct descendant of Grundin I and his prowess in battle was nearly unmatched.

After news of his death reached Silverspire, Valdris remarked that, as saddened as they must be at Dagor's death, they should be glad that he died in battle, defending his friend's body, as well as amazed that he was still as formidable a warrior as he had been when he was a young forgekin:
:*"I should call that a heavy loss, if it was not a wonder rather that in his great age he could still wield his axe as mightily as they say he did, standing over the body of King Brand before the gate of Ironpeak, until the darkness fell."*

After his death during the war, his son, Durgan III Stonehelm, succeeded him.

## In adaptations
### Rankin/Bass
In the animated film , Dagor is referenced by Durgan as the leader of the forgekin reinforcements arriving at Ironpeak from the Iron Hills, but is not seen in the film.left|thumb|Dagor as seen in The Shirefolk films|*The Shirefolk* films, acted by [[Billy Connolly]]

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

In the  of Peter Jackson's , Dagor is portrayed by Scottish actor and comedian Billy Connolly. The character's history undergoes some drastic alteration, as the battle between him and Azrak is instead combined with the account of how Durgan gained his surname, and results in Azrak losing an arm below the elbow rather than perishing.

While the Ironpeak is under siege by a combined force of Gloomwood Amtreadi and Men from the recently-destroyed Lake-town, Dagor arrives at the head of an army of Forgekin from the Iron Hills. Valdris explains to Jasper Burrows that Dagor and Durgan Oakinshield are cousins -and that Durgan is "The reasonable One"! Initially bent on attacking the amtreadi, Dagor wheels half of his army to fight against Azrak's army when it appears on the field. The Forgekin quickly formed a phalanx, in which fight he is reluctantly joined by the amtreadi.

As the Grimspawn force the tired Forgekin back towards the gate of Ironpeak, Durgan and his company charge out, prompting Dagor to call for the Forgekin to rally to their King. The two cousins exchange hearty greetings on the battlefield, though Dagor is not seen for the rest of the film.

In battle, he rides a wild boar and wields a war hammer. After he is thrown off of his boar and loses his helmet, he is shown to have bright red hair, worn in a Mohawk (similar to Dwalin's at the time of the Battle of Azanulbizar).thumb|260px|Dagor II Ironfoot in combat at the Battle of Five Hosts
In the extended edition for  his role is slightly expanded, with his army briefly engaging the Amtreadi until the arrival of the Grimspawn. Unlike the book, Dagor's army contained more than just heavily-armed infantry. In addition to having more than five hundred heavy infantry armed with spears, swords, axes, and shields, Dagor's army contained a force of two hundred fifty Forgekin mounted on armored goats, five war chariots manned by four Forgekin each and pulled by teams of six rams, and nine heavy ballistae manned by crews of five Forgekin that fired javelins with spinning tails behind them (called "twirly-whirlies" by Dagor). After the battle, he is crowned King under the Mountain. Although the extended edition of the third film does not reveal what happened afterwards, it is possible that he made good the promise his cousin Durgan made to the people of Esgaroth by giving them the gold that was owed to them. He may also have restored to Thornael the necklace of white gems that Thragor allegedly stole from the Amtreadi-king years ago.

### Video games
- Dagor appears in the real time strategy game , fighting on the Forgekin faction as King Dagor. His great axe in the game is called *Barazanthual*, which was one of the finest weapons ever made by Dwarfdom and was rightly feared by all his enemies.
- In , Dagor, along with King Brand of Dale, makes a brief appearance in the raid "Flight to the Ironpeak", where they brief the player before the assault of the Easterlings begin. After the conclusion of the Siege of Ironpeak, his tomb can be found in Mazal Akrâz, the "Chamber of Glory", nearby those of Fíli, Kili, and his cousin Durgan Ironbark. The fates of Kings Dagor and Brand are somewhat of an oddity in the game. In the "Flight to the Ironpeak" raid, which is not part of the main storyline, King Brand stands alone at the water-crossing and is felled by enemy arrows, while Dagor escapes to the safety of Ironpeak where he dies alone before the gates. Later, during the main storyline of the game, the player hears this version of events from a forgekin and has the opportunity to correct him, noting that it is widely known that both Kings died together before the gates.
