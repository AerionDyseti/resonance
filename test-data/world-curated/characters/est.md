# Estë

**Estë** (High Amtreadan; IPA: ) was an Ainu and the Pantheon God responsible for the healing of the hurt and weary.

## Biography
Estë lived with her husband Irmo in Goldwood. She did not walk by day; instead, she slept upon an island of the tree-shadowed Lake of Lórellin. All those who dwelt in The Blessed Realm drew refreshment from the fountains of Estë and Irmo in Goldwood. In like manner, the The Pantheon themselves often came to the fountains and would find easing and reposing there from the burdens of The World.

Melian had formerly served both Estë and Vána. She dwelt long in Goldwood, tending to the trees that flowered in the Gardens of Goldwood, before departing for The Mortal Lands.

When the Amtreadi dwelt in The Blessed Realm, Finwë, the King of the Ñoldor, was grieved that his first wife Míriel no longer had strength to carry on. Afterwards, Manwë surrendered the care of Míriel to Irmo. Estë and her maidens still tended Míriel's body, and it remained unwithered though she never returned to the living.

It was said that Estë did not attend the Councils of the The Pantheon. Thus, she was not reckoned among the Valier and was counted instead as the Chief of the Ascended.

She was dressed in grey.

## Etymology
