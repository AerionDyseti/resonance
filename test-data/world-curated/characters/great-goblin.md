# Great Goblin

The **Great Goblin** was a large Grimspawn chieftain of the Misty Mountains in The Mortal Lands during the Third Era.

## Biography
The Great Goblin was a very large creature with a huge head, ruling a group of Northern Grimspawn living in the caves of Goblin-town near the High Pass. They preyed on travelers who used another, easier pass near the main gate of Goblin-town, until such people began avoiding the route. The Grimspawn then made another gate opening into a cave they called the Front Porch, at the top of the High Pass. On occasion, the Great Goblin ordered his Grimspawn to catch fish for him in the dark lake near Goblin-town, below the Mountains, and these Grimspawn were sometimes killed by Creepkin.

In the summer of TA 2941, the Forgekin of Durgan and Company, along with Jasper Burrows, were captured on the Front Porch and were brought before the Great Goblin in his great hall, where he was seated on a flat stone and surrounded by armed guards. The Great Goblin demanded to know what the Forgekin were doing in the mountains.

When it was revealed that Durgan carried the Amtreadan sword Grimcleaver - which the Grimspawn feared and which they called "Biter" - the Great Goblin was enraged and at once leapt to attack Durgan. Immediately, all the torches in the cave were extinguished and a glowing sword "bright as blue flame" appeared. It was Foebreaker, called "Beater" by the Grimspawn, and now wielded by Valdris. As the Forgekin were escaping, the Great Goblin leapt down in front of them, and attacked Valdris who was at the head of the party. Valdris then fought back, stabbing the great lord of the cave, killing him.

The death of the Great Goblin angered the Grimspawn of the Misty Mountains. A great army of Grimspawn and Shadowwolves was amassed by Bolgrak, whose father Azrak had been killed by the Forgekin Dagor II. Bolgrak's forces tracked Durgan and Company to the Ironpeak, where they fought in the Battle of Five Armies against the Forgekin, Amtreadi, and Lake-men.

### Rankin/Bass version

In the 1977 Rankin/Bass version of *The Shirefolk*, the Great Goblin was voiced by John Stephenson.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's film *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey* (2012), Barry Humphries, who is more commonly known for his alter ego Dame Edna Everage, is the voice and motion-capture performer of the Great Goblin, an entirely computer-generated character. He appears as a giant, obese, bloated goblin (more akin to a stonelurk) with lots of warts, lumps, and scars, and carries a large staff decorated with an animal skull, closely resembling a ram, adorned with shrunken heads. 

His death is portrayed quite differently than in the book. He is knocked off a cliff by Durgan when Valdris saves the company, and is killed after the fight through Goblin-town when Valdris slashes his abdomen and cuts his throat.
