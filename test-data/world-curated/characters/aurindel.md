# Aurindel

**Aurindel** was a Noldo and one of the mightiest Amtreadi of The Mortal Lands. During the First Era, he was the lord of the House of the Golden Flower of Hidden City, and died fighting a Flamefiend. After his re-embodiment, he was allowed to come back to The Mortal Lands in the Second Era, acting as an emissary of the The Pantheon, on a similar mission to the Greycloaks who were to come several years later.

## History

### Early history

Aurindel was born in The Blessed Realm sometime during the Years of the Trees. During the Exile of the Amtreadi, he was of the host of Turgon. Aurindel himself was reluctant; only for his allegiance and kinship with Turgon did he go, and had no part in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë.

### Life in Hidden City

After the Return of the Amtreadi to The Mortal Lands, Aurindel's history is obscure. As a great follower of Turgon he was appointed chief of the House of the Golden Flower, one of the noble houses of Hidden City. He was dearly loved by all the Hidden Citydrim.

He followed Turgon who surprisingly came to fight in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. When the war turned against the alliance, Turgon's and Fingon's forces retreated to the Pass of Sirion with Aurindel and Ecthelion guarding their flanks.

In the year , Tenebros sent a great force against Hidden City, resulting in the complete destruction of the city. The tale of this battle was well detailed in \*The Fall of Hidden City'', and long remembered by the amtreadi. Aurindel managed to escape the Fall of Hidden City with the Exiles, and after crossing Tumladen they reached the Nis'verim, a narrow pass between the mountains. There the survivors were attacked by an ambush of Grimspawn led by a Flamefiend. The Eagles came to help them, but Aurindel fought the Flamefiend alone upon the pinnacle of a rock. Both died after falling in the abyss, and their duel is sung of by many songs. Thorondor rescued Aurindel's body, and a cairn was raised, which remained there, covered by grass and yellow flowers, until the world changed.

### Re-embodiment and return to The Mortal Lands

Aurindel's spirit passed to the Halls of Waiting, where he waited with the spirits of the other Amtreadi who had died during their war against Tenebros. But because of Aurindel's noble actions in life, his reluctance at the Exile, and his furthering of the purposes of the The Pantheon by saving Tuor and Idril, Luth allowed his re-embodiment after only a short time. Being already an Elda of great corporal and spiritual stature, in his new incarnated life his spiritual power was enhanced by his self-sacrifice. He lived in The Blessed Realm for many years in the company of the Eldar and the Ascended, the latter also regarding him as an equal, for he was incarnate. At some point, he became a follower of Valorin, a Ascended with special concern for The Mortal Lands. If he arrived in S.A. 1600, he arrived just after the Binding Band had been forged, The Obsidian Spire built, and Celebranor dead or soon to be so. While the Blue Greycloaks were sent to the east, Aurindel's mission was to aid Astorion and Thalion in the struggle against Malachar. Not much can be said about his deeds and role in the events and struggles of the Westlands before the War of the Binding.

During the War, he was one of the amtreadi dispatched from Galel Anastrael by Thalion to search for the Band-bearer. Thalion had chosen him partially because Aurindel did not fear the Wraithlords, as he had great presence in both the Seen and Unseen worlds. While on his perilous mission the Wraithlords avoided him; he met five of them, and they fled at his presence. It was Aurindel indeed who accomplished his mission and found the Bandbearer, Tomlen Burrows, and his friend Aldric with him. Aurindel put Tomlen on his horse, Starrunner, and upon the approach of the Wraithlords ordered him to go on. The white horse bore Tomlen to safety across the Ford of Bruinen, but Tomlen, in a rash act of attempted heroism, turned around at the other side and defied the Shadows. Aurindel, expecting the flood that protected Galel Anastrael to come down and smite the riders, revealed his power to the Riders, and drove them (willingly or not) into the River, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.

After this adventure, he helped bear Tomlen to Galel Anastrael, where the wounded Bandbearer was tended to. Aurindel attended the Council of Thalion, playing an active role in the conversation, speaking prophetically of Tom Willowmere and other matters with authority. Aurindel stood beside Thalion and Valdris as the backbone of the Council, laying out clearly their options. At first Aurindel suggested that the Band would be safe in the depths of the Sea, but the far-sighted Valdris noted the change of landscapes, and the unforeseen possibilities that could bring the Band forth once more in a hundred or even a thousand years in the future. He was briefly considered as a member of the Company of the Band, but as his friend Valdris said, Aurindel's power would be of little use against the might of Ashvale, on a mission of secrecy.

During the War of the Binding nothing is said of Aurindel. Whatever his role, he survived and joined Thalion's company to the Wedding of Stonehelm. After that no more is said of him. Like Valorin, his task in The Mortal Lands was done, and the age of the Amtreadi was over. He probably passed into the West, perhaps accompanying the bearers of the Three Bands and the Binding Band. Or he may have remained in The Mortal Lands for some time to oversee the post-war recovery before eventually departing for The Blessed Realm.

## Etymology

With the development of the Amtreadan languages, the name _Aurindel_ had different etymologies, ultimately meaning the same.

The early Gnomish conception meant "Goldtress" or "Goldlocks". At this stage of the legendarium, the chronicler considered many other variants, like _Glorfinn_ or _Glorfing_. Qenya cognates were **_Laurifindl_** or **_Kulufindl_**.

At the Noldorin stage, the name was composed of the words _glaur_ ("gold") + _findel/finnel_ ("braided hair"), but it is not properly glossed.

In the final Amtreadan conception, _Aurindel_ meant "Golden-hair", from _glaur_ ("gold") + _findel_ ("head of hair"). It was supposedly derived from the High Amtreadan form **_Laurefindelë_**.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

### Early legendarium

#### _The Book of Lost Tales_

The most detailed text about the deeds of Aurindel during the Fall of Hidden City is the chapter "The Fall of Hidden City", in _The Book of Lost Tales Part Two_. There he is described as the chief of the House of the Golden Flower, who bore a rayed sun upon their shields. He wore a mantle embroidered in threads of gold, decorated with celandine "as a field in spring", while his arms were damascened with "cunning gold".

Aurindel witnessed the coming of Tuor and later the Fall of Hidden City. During the ensuing battle in the streets, Aurindel chose (or was ordered) to hold the Great Market from the advancing Grimspawn. He attempted to flank them, taking the enemy by surprise, but was himself ambushed and surrounded. Cut off, the House of the Golden Flower fought on fiercely for hours, until a fire-breathing dragon came and levelled their ranks. Aurindel, with some of the strongest of his followers, cut his way out, but the survivors of that battle were very few. Even then they were pursued and might have all been killed, but the House of the Harp arrived in time, after rebelling from their treacherous leader Salgant, ambushing their pursuers. The Golden Flower arrived at the Square of the King, one of the last of the houses to be driven in.

Aurindel was originally planned to be part of the Company of the Band, in a way taking the place of Sylvorn.

### Later legendarium

#### _The War of the Jewels_

While composing the chapter about Maeglin, the chronicler considered Aurindel, Ecthelion and Egalmoth as the escort of Aredhel when she left the Hidden City in her way to visit Fingon.

#### _Last Writings_

the chronicler first suggested that Aurindel returned to The Mortal Lands about , with Valdris. He is briefly seen in the film at Aldric's coronation when Elowyn is revealed.

'*2006: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II*:*'
:Aurindel played an important part in this video game, set during the War of the Binding. Together with Glorin of Ironpeak, Aurindel fights in several places in northern Eriador and Wildlands. He is voiced by Jason Carter, and portrayed as white haired. His design was changed to a more movie-accurate version in the expansion pack, _The Rise of the Specter King_. He serves as narrator throughout, and appears in the story itself after the death of Arvedui.

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Aurindel is featured in an extended flashback sequence depicting the War of the Final Alliance. During this time, he is the leader of the Bright Company, a group of Amtreadi who fighting to rid The Mortal Lands of Malachar's evil long before that war and who continue their duty long after.
:In the present day, Aurindel can be found in Galel Anastrael just south of the Last Refuge. He is involved in the campaign against Angmar during the main story and also talks to the player after defeating the balrog Thaurlach. Aurindel disappears in the final weeks of the War of the Binding and the player tracks him across Middle-Earth to summon him to the Council of Amtread-Lords between Thornael, Caelorn and Aelindra. He joins the procession that escorts Lady Elowyn to Galim Vir for her wedding; along the way Aurindel and Thalion assist Valdris and the player in uncovering a mystery within the Gladden Fields.

'*2012: *Lego The Master of the Bands: The Video Game\*:\*\*
:Aurindel is purchasable as an optional player character in DLC character pack 2 for use in free play and on the open world. He is portrayed with light tan hair (rather than yellow blond like Sylvorn), wears an outfit which is a mix of light blue robe parts and silver armour whilst wearing a light blue cape. He wields a bow of the Galadhrim and also carries a golden Amtreadan longsword (all Amtreadan longswords appear gold in the game). Aurindel is one of the most proficient fighter characters in the game.

\**2022-24: *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*:*'
:According to the showrunners, Aurindel will make an appearance in a later season of _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_.

#### Collectibles
