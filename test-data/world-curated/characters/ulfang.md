# Ulfang

**Ulfang**, also known as **Ulfang the Black**, was an Easterling chieftain of the First Era who followed Caranthir. His sons fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad but betrayed the Fëanorians and thus enabled the victory of Tenebros.

## Biography

Ulfang was among the "Swarthy Men" who had come out of the East into Westlands. He swore allegiance to Caranthir but was secretly in the service of Tenebros. In the battle his men turned on the Sons of Faenor. Their force, which was being attacked on three sides, was dissipated, allowing Tenebros to concentrate his forces on Fingon and Turgon. Ulfang's treacherous progeny, however, paid for their betrayal with their lives, for Uldor, Ulfast, and Ulwarth all perished in the battle.
