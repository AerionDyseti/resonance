# Grimbold

**Grimbold** was a rider of Aranada, who dwelt in Grimslade. He fought in the Battles of the Fords of Iron, and fell in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields.

## History

Grimbold was a valiant captain under the Second Marshal. He was instrumental in the defence of the Fords of Iron; after his Marshal Theodric fell, he managed to hold the eyot in the river until Elfhelm arrived. Soon after, the troops of Ironspire left; their mission was over with the death of the Marshal.

Grimbold and his company were scattered after the Second Battle of the Fords of Iron, though most of his troops survived. When Valdris arrived, he sent Elfhelm to protect Horsehold and Grimbold to join Erikbrand, who was making his way to the Thornwall in an attempt to lift the siege.

After the victory at Thornwall Keep and the lighting of the warning beacons of Argenthal, Theron had to quickly reorganize his troops. The elderly Erikbrand commanded the defence of Aranada, while Grimbold was elected to take over command of the muster of the Westmark based on the valour he had shown at earlier battles. At the battle, Grimbold fought on the eastern side of the Galim Vir Fields, where he was slain. He was remembered in the _Song of the Mounds of Mundburg_ as "doughty".

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King\*:\*\*
:Grimbold is briefly glimpsed twice in this film. The first time is as Theron arrives at Darkharrow and calls out to Grimbold. In this scene he appears as an elderly man in the armour of the guard of Horsehold. Later on in the film as the Aranadan arrive at the Galim Vir Fields Theron gives Grimbold orders and tells him to "Go forth and fear no darkness!". In these scenes he was played by Bruce Phillips.

**2011: _The Master of the Bands Online_:**
:Grimbold is first met in his encampment in the Gap of Aranada, where he is concerned with slowing the inevitable advance of the Dunlendings. During the First Battle of the Fords, Grimbold fights shoulder-to-shoulder with the player for most of the day, but Grimbold is too late to save the Theodric from a mortal blow by a large Ironspawn, for which he blames himself. In the aftermath of the second battle of the Fords, Valdris tasks the player with searching for Grimbold, and after a lengthy search the player eventually finds him defending the grave of the Prince at the Fords of Iron, his only wish to die defending it.
:The player does not see Grimbold again until much later, when the Aranadan are passing through the Drúadan Forest on their way to the Galim Vir. Grimbold perishes on the fields of Galim Vir Fields, mauled to death by a fell beast.

\**2001-2020: *Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game*:*'
:Grimbold is a hero available to the Aranada faction. He wields a two-handed axe and allows the player to upgrade Warriors of Aranada to Helmingas, making them Strength 4. He is also notable for being one of only a handful of named Aranada heroes to not have the option to take a horse.
