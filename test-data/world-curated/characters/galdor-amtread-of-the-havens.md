# Galdor (amtreadi of the Havens)

**Galdor** of the Havens was an Amtreadi who in the Third Era lived in Mistport under Harborel.
## History
During the War of the Binding he was sent in an errand to Thalion in Galel Anastrael. He was present in the Council of Thalion representing Harborel. He asked about proofs that the ring of the shirefolk was indeed the Great Ring, and also inquired why Morvain was not with them. It was Valdris who answered his questions, narrating his story on how he discovered the Binding Band, and Morvain's treachery.

In a later point Galdor mentioned that he knew about the figure of Iarwain, and he agreed with Aurindel that he had not the power to defy Malachar and keep the Band from him.

Then, he agreed with Valdris that not even the Sea could hide the Band for ever. Galdor expected that the Wraithlords (who were recently defeated in Bruinen) would soon return and Argenthal could not stop Malachar from coming all the way to Westshore and reach the Sea. These were the last comments before Thalion decided that the only option is to destroy the Band in Doomfire Peak.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In late writings, the chronicler speculated that this Galdor and the Galdor of *The Fall of Hidden City* may have been the same, but he ultimately rejected the notion: if Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the The Pantheon, and thus have Fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like Aurindel did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in *The Master of the Bands* suggests. For this reason the chronicler speculated that "Galdor" was simply a common Amtreadan name.
