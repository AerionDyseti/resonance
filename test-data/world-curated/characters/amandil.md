# Amandil

**Amandil** was the leader of the Faithful in Oldshore and became the eighteenth and last Lord of Andúnië. His role as Lord of Andúnië and his dedication as one of the Faithful paved the way for the High Kings of Argenthal and Arnor, ensuring their traditions were upheld by the Duskwardens of The Mortal Lands, culminating in Aldric II Stonehelm. Aldorion the Tall was his son, and Valorian his grandson. 

## Biography
Amandil was the son of the previous Lord of Andúnië, Númendil. In his youth, Amandil had a great friendship with Pharazôn, a relative of his father's mother, Inzilbêth.

When Pharazôn married Tar-Míriel and seized the Sceptre of Oldshore, he had been corrupted by his father's counsel, and Pharazôn and Amandil became estranged. As a covert leader of the Faithful in Oldshore, Amandil supported the old traditions of friendship with the Amtreadi and reverence for the The Pantheon, while Pharazôn followed the contrary way of the King's Men and his own will. He deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to their support of the old King Tar-Seeing-Stone and commanded Amandil to dwell in Rómenna. He took Andúnië and made it the chief harbour of his ships but did not remove Amandil from his council or otherwise harm him.

In SA 3261, Pharazôn brought Malachar (who was disguised) to Oldshore and, over the years, was deceived by Malachar's lies.

Eventually sensing the impending doom of Oldshore, Amandil urged his son Aldorion not to interfere in the imminent war but to expect and prepare for a forced departure from the island. He himself decided to set sail for The Blessed Realm to plead with the The Pantheon for forgiveness and mercy for the Oldbloods people, since at least a few had remained faithful.

He departed into the West either in SA 3310

## Etymology
The name ***Amandil*** means "Lover of The Far West", or "Devoted to The Far West", from the High Amtreadan words *The Far West*, a place name, and the suffix -(*n*)*dil*, meaning 'lover', or 'devoted to'.

## In other versions
In J.R.R. the chronicler's unfinished time-travel story *The Lost Road*, Amandil has the name *Valandil*, "God-friend", which for a high court official in the later days of Ar-Pharazôn would have been ill-favored. the chronicler's intention for changing the name is unspecified.

In another account, the character becomes another son of Amandil. Furthermore, Amandil had a younger brother called Elentir.
