# Ceorl

**Ceorl** was a rider of Aranada at the end of the Third Era. 

## History
After the loss of the Second Battle of the Fords of Iron, Erikbrand withdrew his Riders to Thornwall Keep, and sent Ceorl south as a messenger to warn Éomer. He was surprised to come across King Theron's army riding north, ready to launch their own defence of the Fords. The news brought by Ceorl caused Theron to reconsider his strategy, and he rode instead to join Erikbrand at Thornwall Keep, so setting the stage for the mighty Battle of the Thornwall. 

## Etymology
Like other Aranadan, Ceorl's name comes from Old English. It refers to a particular rank in Anglo-Saxon society (also known as Carl and Churl), in fact the lowest rank possible while remaining a freeman. Historically, these people would not normally have been professional soldiers, so if Ceorl's background follows his name, we might guess that he was a farmer or tradesman who had been pressed into military service to help deal with the imminent threat to Aranada.

:Ceorl was voiced by Michael McStay. Virtually the whole of Ceorl's dialogue from the book was retained in the production.

:As Theron rode directly to the Thornwall, so there was no need for a messenger.

:A Decipher card identifies a one of the riders of Aranada as Ceorl.
