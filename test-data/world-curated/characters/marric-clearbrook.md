# Marric Clearbrook

**Marric "Marric" Clearbrook** was a Shirefolk of the Shirelands and one of Tomlen Burrows cousins and closest friends. He loved boats and ponies and had a great interest in the maps of The Mortal Lands. He was also one of the nine companions of the Company of the Band, and later became the eighth Master of Brookshire.

## Biography

Marric was born in TA 2982. He was the only child of Saradoc Clearbrook (TA 2940 - FO 11) the Master of Brookshire, and Esmeralda Ashford (TA 2936 - ?), the younger sister of Paladin II Ashford. This made him first cousin to Paladin's son Perrin, who was also his closest friend.

### War of the Binding

Marric was often considered the most perceptive and intelligent of the shirefolk, for example, knowing of the Binding Band and its power even before Tomlen Burrows left the Shirelands. He guarded Burrow's End after Jasper's party, protecting Tomlen from the various and often unwanted guests. He also was the force behind "the Conspiracy" of Sam, Perrin, Fredric Barleycorn and himself to help Tomlen. Thus, even before the Quest of Doomfire Peak began, Marric was well prepared and organized; he assembled their gear and brought ponies. As a Clearbrook he also had a key to the gate in the High Hay. This shortcut through the Old Forest served them well, because they avoided the Shadow Riders and met Tom Willowmere, who helped them. At the Barrow Hills, Marric acquired his sword, a work of Oldshore.

At Crossway, he was not present in the Wanderer's Rest when Tomlen foolishly put on the Band; but was outside taking a walk, and was nearly killed by the Wraithlords who arrived. At Galel Anastrael, he was seen studying maps and plotting their path. His approval to the Company came with only a little less reluctance than Perrin's; they were the two selected to relay news to the people of the Shirelands about Tomlen's journey, but in the end Valdris, believing in the friendship and loyalty shown to Tomlen and Sam, requested that Thalion allow the two shirefolk to come along. At Hill of Sight he was captured along with Perrin by a band of Morvain's fighting Ironspawn, but he made a good account for himself, and Valdric valiantly defended him, though Valdric died in the attempt.

After being captured by the Ironspawn, Uglúk crudely tried to bandage Marric's head wound. Despite this, a scar would remain on Marric's head forever. The Ironspawn then gave to them an Grimspawn drink, which would keep the Shirefolk alive during the fast march towards Ironspire. When they neared Deeproot Forest, Grishnákh began searching them, attempting to find the Binding Band, which he believed they carried. Before he was able to escape with the shirefolk, Éomer's éored attacked and all of the Grimspawn, including Grishnákh, were slain. During the confusion of the battle Marric and Perrin were able to escape into Deeproot Forest.

Escaping with Perrin into Deeproot Forest, Rootbeard and the newly risen Valdris the White met him. Along with Perrin, he drank significant amounts of Treewarden-draught, which contributed to speedy gains in height and hair growth. Accompanying Rootbeard to the Treewarden-moot, and later to Ironspire, he and Perrin were set as guardians following Morvain's fall. It was here that Marric encountered King Theron of Aranada, and was reunited with the remaining members of the Company (save Tomlen and Sam).

Separated from Perrin when Valdris took the latter to Argenthal, Marric swore fealty to Theron and became his squire. Without permission from his liege, he rode to the Battle of Galim Vir Fields in the care of young Dernhelm (who, unbeknownst to Marric, was actually Theron's niece Éowyn). When the Wraithlords attacked the Riders of Aranada and Theron was injured, Marric and Éowyn faced the Specter King of Coldreach alone. Here, Marric's companion revealed herself to be Éowyn. Battling both Black Wing and the Wraithlords alone, Éowyn was well assisted by Marric's crucial move: his sword, was one of the few weapons able to pierce the Wraithlord's form, but at a great expense to himself. He stabbed the Specter King behind the knee as he was about to kill Éowyn. This was enough to allow Éowyn to finish off the Specter King. Marric heard Theron's last words, but went unnoticed by the honor escort of Riders and was found wandering the city by Perrin. He was saved by the healing of Aldric and recovered fully, leaving Galim Vir to tend to the wounded Perrin at the Field of Cormallen.

For his bravery in battle, King Éomer, as the new King of Aranada, knighted him and gave him the name of "Holdwine". During the Scouring of the Shirelands, he was in the forefront of the Battle of Bybrook, using the Horn of Aranada presented to him by Éowyn.

### Later life

Upon their return he and Perrin both married. They were also the tallest of shirefolk - Marric being the slightly taller of the two - taller even than the legendary Banric "Bullhorn" Ashford, due to their having drunk large amounts of Treewarden-draught. Marric married Estella Barleycorn some time after the end of the Third Era. He became the Master of Brookshire in SR 1432 (FA 11), living at Brook Hall and Crickethollow. He wrote _Old Words and Names in the Shirelands._ Although he was not recorded as having any children within the family trees, he had at least one son. At the age of 102, Marric returned to Aranada and Argenthal with Perrin, dying there some time after the year FO 63. He was laid to rest in Argenthal, and when Stonehelm died in FO 120, he and Perrin were entombed beside the great king.
