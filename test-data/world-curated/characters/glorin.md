# Glorin

**Glorin** was a forgekin of Grundin Folk, the son of Gróin, the brother of Óin, and the father of Thorngar of the Company of the Band.  He is most famous as one of Durgan's companions on the quest to Ironpeak. 77 years after the Quest of Ironpeak,  Glorin attended the Council of Thalion with his son Thorngar, where the latter would represent forgekin in the Company of the Band

## History
Glorin was likely born in Dunland, where the Forgekin of Grundin's Line dwelt in exile  Glorin was present at the Battle of Azanulbizar,

Glorin was the fifth Forgekin in the fourth group to arrive at Burrow's End for the Unexpected Party, and he came wearing a white hood.  Glorin did not assist in setting the table nor did he bring a musical instrument out when Durgan called for music.  After Jasper had his fit of fright he overheard Glorin sneer that the shirefolk looked "more like a grocer than a burglar" when he saw him "bobbing and puffing on the mat".  This affronted Jasper enough to make him agree to undertake the quest.  Then, when Valdris proclaimed that Jasper was his choice he scowled at Glorin so fiercely that the forgekin huddled back in his chair, and later glaring at Jasper.

On their quest Glorin was quite useful, especially at making fires, although on the night the company met the stonelurks, William, Bert, and Tom, he and his brother failed to start one and began to fight, yet though first they quarreled.  On the night when the company came to the glade of the Shadowwolves, Glorin along with his brother, Dori, Nori and Ori secured a seat in a huge pine tree.  At Bjorn's home Glorin and Óin were the fifth pair of Forgekin to appear as Valdris spun their tale.  And when released from his barrel near Esgaroth, Glorin was one of the Forgekin who was waterlogged and seemed but half alive, and needed to be carried ashore.

Glorin fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies.  He was given his share of the treasure by Dagor Ironfoot, who became King after Durgan's death. Glorin settled in the Ironpeak, along with the survivors of the battle, and would grow wealthy in Ironpeak under the leadership of King Dagor.

### War of the Binding
In October  Glorin and his son Thorngar were sent by Dagor Ironfoot to Galel Anastrael to seek advice concerning the fate of Borin's Colony in Shadowdeep.  When Tomlen Burrows recovered from his wounds and attended the feast, it was Glorin who sat next to him and gave him the news from Ironpeak and surrounding lands since the time of Jasper.  Later, at the Council of Thalion, Glorin spoke of the shadow that had fallen upon his people, Borin's expedition and of the sinister messenger from Ashvale who had come to inquire about Shirefolk and where they dwelt. Glorin's greatest contribution to the War of the Binding was his son Thorngar, who joined the Company of the Band.

It is possible that Glorin fought in the Battle of Dale against the Easterlings during the War of the Binding, for he lived until .

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In both the early manuscript of *The Shirefolk* and in the published version, Glorin had heard of Jasper's great-great-great-grand-uncle Bullhorn Ashford, who accidentally invented the game of Golf.  However, only in the early manuscript it was mentioned that Glorin was very fond of golf.

In *The Company of the Band*, the forgekin Burin (also Frár), being Borin's son (from Durgan and Company) was suppose to accompany Glorin to the Council of Thalion, and that would later join The Company of the Band, though it was changed to Thorngar, and also changed to be Glorin's son, in the final draft of the novel.
