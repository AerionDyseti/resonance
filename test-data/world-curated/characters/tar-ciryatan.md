# Tar-Ciryatan

**Tar-Ciryatan**, or **Ar-Balkumagân** in Adûnaic, was the twelfth King of Oldshore. His rule marked the first coming of the shadow upon the Oldbloods and their rulers; the speaking out openly against the The Pantheon and the Ban, colonialism, and dominion abroad.

## Biography

Tar-Ciryatan was born in SA 1634 and was the son of Tar-Minastir. He loved ships and everything connected to ship-lore and ship building. His heart was restless in Oldshore and before succeeding his father, he went on many voyages around the world travelling east, north, and south but never west as many yearned to do but never could because of the Ban of the The Pantheon.

He succeeded his father in SA 1869, wresting the Sceptre from him prematurely. Tar-Ciryatan became a mighty king, building great armadas of ships, and the Oldbloods began large-scale colonization of the coasts of The Mortal Lands, holding the Middle Men in subjugation and demanding great tribute from them. As Tar-Ciryatan was greedy of wealth in these days, he received the pick of the many metals and gems that had been taken by his men in payment or as spoils of war.

He abdicated in SA 2029 after ruling for one-hundred and sixty years, and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Atanamir. He died in SA 2035.

## In adaptations

In a role-playing game, Ciryatan was referred to as the father of the Specter King of Coldreach, but this relationship is not founded in J.R.R. the chronicler's work.
