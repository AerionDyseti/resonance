# Vairë

**Vairë** (High Amtreadan; IPA: or - "Weaver") was an Ainu and Pantheon God responsible for the weaving of the story of The World.

## Biography

Vairë was counted among the Valier, the Queens of the The Pantheon, though she was not as great in power or prestige as some. Her "storied webs" covered the Halls of Neth, where she apparently lived with Neth, her husband.

## Etymology

In High Amtreadan, **_Vairë_** means "Weaver", and was derived from the Primitive Quendian _weirē_, which derives from the root _wey_ ("weave, wind"). Her Ñoldorin name is **Gwîr**, from _gwi_ ("net, web").
