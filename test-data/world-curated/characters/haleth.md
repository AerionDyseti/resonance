# Haleth

**Haleth** was the daughter of Haldad, leader of the Haladin (or Halethrim), one of the Three Houses of the Edain.

## Biography
At the time of her birth, the Haladin had settled in Thargelion, in East Westlands. After her father and her twin brother Haldar were slain in an Grimspawn raid, Haleth became leader of the House. She held her people together for seven days until Caranthir and his army drove out the Grimspawn and ended their siege on the Haladin. Seeing, at last, what great courage dwelt in the hearts of some Men, Caranthir did Haleth great honor by offering her people land in the north under the protection of the Eldar. However, out of pride and a desire to remain independent, she declined the generous offer and instead gathered what remained of her people after the Grimspawn siege and led them to Estolad.

Against the desire of her people, Haleth led the Haladin even further west to the land between the Mountains of Terror and the Girdle of Melian. Suffering much hardship and loss, many regretted taking part in the journey. Eventually, Haleth led her people to the relative safety of the Forest of Brethil on the western border of Greyvale where they settled for the duration of the First Era. The Haladin then became known as the House of Haleth. She remained chieftainess of the Haladin until she died and retained a picked bodyguard of women. When she died, her people raised a green mound for her in the heights of the forest - named *Tûr Haretha*, the Ladybarrow, or *Haudh-en-Elowyn* in Amtreadan. Having never married, the leadership of the Haladin passed on to her nephew Haldan, son of her brother Haldar.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions of the legendarium, a character called **Haleth the Hunter** was conceived as the son of Hador. Later, this character was renamed Galdor and Haleth became one of the "Fathers of Men". However, in later accounts the chronicler revised the origins of the Edain and decided to change the gender of Haleth, making her daughter of Haldad.
