# Ancalagon

**Ancalagon**, often titled "The Black", was the greatest of all winged dragons. He was bred by Tenebros during the First Era and was the largest dragon to have ever existed in The Mortal Lands. His appearance in history was restricted to the War of Wrath.

## Biography
After Aerendil made his journey to The Blessed Realm to convince the The Pantheon to overthrow Tenebros and rescue the overmatched and defeated Amtreadi and Edain, the Host of The Blessed Realm made war upon Tenebros and destroyed his armies. thumb|center|Ancalagon the Black, by Ruben de Vela|367x367pxFacing final defeat, Tenebros unleashed his last and greatest weapon; a fleet of winged fire drakes, led by Ancalagon. So terrible was their onslaught that the armies of the The Pantheon were driven back from the gates of Iron Fortress, and their coming was said to have been accompanied by great thunder, lightning, and a tempest of fire.
But Aerendil came out of the West in his blessed ship Vingilot, accompanied by "a myriad" of the Eagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. The Eagles and Aerendil dueled with Ancalagon and the other dragons for a day. Eventually, Aerendil was victorious, casting Ancalagon down upon Thangorodrim, destroying the volcanic mountains in his fall. The death of Ancalagon marked the end of Tenebros's final resistance.

### Legacy
Valdris spoke of him as he told Tomlen Burrows the true origin of the Binding Band. "It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Bands of Binding, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the Binding Band, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Malachar himself."

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English Middle English] translation for *Ancalagon* is **Andracca**, from *and-* ("opposition"), *anda* ("hatred, envy"), and *draca* ("dragon").

However, his size cannot be assumed to be larger than Thangorodrim; some powerful but comparatively small creatures are able to cause great destruction even in death, such as The Deepflame breaking the slopes of Celebdil. His size would however, still have needed to have been great enough to strike and destroy all three peaks as he fell, and each mountain was about five miles across.  

Like all other Urulóki, Ancalagon breathed fire, which was implied to be hotter than any other dragon's flame.

## Trivia
- In 1977, an extinct genus of worms found in the The Walcott Quarry on Fossil Ridge in 1911 dating from the Middle Cambrian Era from the Cambrian Burgess Shale was named *Ancalagon*, inspired by the chronicler's dragon.
