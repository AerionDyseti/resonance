# Amras

**Amras** and his younger twin brother, Amrod, were Ñoldorin princes, the youngest of the seven Sons of Faenor. Through their mother Nerdanel's line, they inherited red hair, instead of Faenor's dark hair.

## Biography

### Life in The Blessed Realm

Amras, and his twin Amrod, were born sometime in the Years of the Trees. Nerdanel initially named both twins _Ambarussa_ and, when Faenor begged that their names should be different, she then provided _Umbarto_, though not to any twin specifically. Either disturbed by such an ominous name, or because he misheard her, Faenor changed it to _Ambarto_ and gave it as the mother-name to Telufinwë, the younger twin. but the younger twin, Amrod, had a darker shade of red hair after childhood and was dearer to Faenor. Faenor and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but traveled far and wide upon the confines of The Blessed Realm, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. They were often guests in the halls of Kang-Somer. Along with Finwë, the sons of Faenor did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Tenebros and The Webmother after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses. Once the cloud passed, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Starstones stolen. They then sped to the Band of Doom where Maedhros informed Luth and, unknowingly, Faenor who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Faenor reacted by cursing both Tenebros and the summons of Luth, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Faenor followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.

Faenor and his sons soon returned to Starhold where, during a great speech by Faenor, they took a terrible oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dared to claim any right in the Starstones, and led most of the Ñoldor into exile. As Faenor was preparing his host for Exile and to return to The Mortal Lands, Nerdanel approached him and begged that he should leave her youngest twin sons, or at least one of them.

### Return to The Mortal Lands

In the morning after the Burning of the Ships at Losgar, Amras noticed the absence of his twin brother Amrod. He explained that Amrod was restless and did not sleep on the ground out of discomfort. He was the last to speak about this matter to Faenor.

Later, Amras and his brothers rescued their father who died in an ambush after Dagor-nuin-Giliath. After Faenor's death, he settled the wide plains of East Westlands between the rivers Celon and Little Gelion where few folk dwelt, and took it as his realm and hunting-ground. He became renown as a great hunter of the woods, though not more than Celegorm. but he was present at each kinslaying. If his brothers needed aid or shelter, he supported them. Amras died during the attack made by the Sons of Faenor on the Havens of Sirion in 538.

## Etymology

**_Amras_** is a Amtreadan word. His father-name is **Pityafinwë** "Little Finwë", from _pitya_ ("little"). Its shorter form was **Pityo**. His mother-name was **Ambarussa** "Top-russet", the name he and his brother called each other.

### Other names

Like the rest of his brothers, Amras was given an Old English name. He was called **Tirgeld**, from the words _tir_ ("glory") and _geld_ ("of worth").

## Other versions

In , Amrod lives beyond the burning of the ships, and follows Amras to East Westlands where they held the lands of Estolad together. They share the same fate, dying during the Third Kinslaying. In later writings, Christopher the chronicler added the death of Amrod. For this reason, wherever both Amrod and Amras appear in the published material it should be read as Amras alone.
