# Swiftbranch

**Swiftbranch**, also called **Quickbough** in the old tongue, was a Treewarden who lived in Treewardwood during the late Third Era. He was notable for being younger and hastier than most of his kind, qualities that made him more approachable to the mortal races.

## History

### War of the Binding

During the War of the Binding in TA 3019, Swiftbranch was among the Treewardens who marched against Morvain at Ironspire. He befriended the Shirefolk Marric Clearbrook and Perrin Ashford during their stay in Treewardwood.

Unlike the elder Treewardens who moved and spoke with ponderous deliberation, Swiftbranch was quick to action and relatively swift in his speech. He was described as "hasty" by Treewarden standards, though still quite slow by the measure of mortal races.

### Guardian of Ironspire

After the fall of Ironspire and the destruction of Morvain's forces, Swiftbranch remained with Rootbeard to guard the ruined fortress and ensure that none of its dark secrets could be recovered by servants of evil. The two Treewardens watched over the flooded pits and shattered tower, allowing the forest to slowly reclaim what had been stolen from it.

## Character

Swiftbranch was considered young by Treewarden standards, which meant he had only lived for a few thousand years rather than tens of thousands. This relative youth made him more energetic and more willing to engage with the "hasty" folk - Amtreadi, Men, and Shirefolk.

He took a particular liking to Marric and Perrin, perhaps seeing in the young Shirefolk a kindred hastiness of spirit. He would speak with them about the history of the forest and the ancient grievances between Trees and those who wielded axes.

## Etymology

The name **Swiftbranch** is a translation of his Treewarden name, referring to the speed with which he could move his limbs compared to other Treewardens. The old tongue name **Quickbough** carries the same meaning.
