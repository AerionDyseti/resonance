# Lenwë

**Lenwë** was a Telerin Amtreadi, founder of the Nandor and the father of Thornhelm.

## Biography

In the Great Journey to The Blessed Realm, Lenwë followed Olwë with the host of the Liinadi until they reached the Greatwater, where he forsook the westward march. Afterwards, he and his followers broke away and went downstream, never crossing the Misty Mountains. He founded the Nandor, which his son Thornhelm later led, and dwelt along the Vales of Greatwater. He disappeared somewhere along the Vales of Greatwater or possibly in Eriador. 

Nothing more of his life, including his ultimate fate, is known.

Lenwë's descendants, hearing of Thingol's great realm, crossed into Westlands under the leadership of his son Thornhelm, becoming the Laegeldrim or Green-amtreadi, who from then onward dwelt in Ossiriand.

## Etymology

The name ***Lenwë*** is the High Amtreadan form of the Amtreadan *Denweg* ("leaving" or "departure").
