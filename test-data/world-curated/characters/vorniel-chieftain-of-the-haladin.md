# Vorniel (Chieftain of the Haladin)

**Vorniel** was an Edain of the House of Haleth and a Chieftain of the Haladin.

## Biography

Vorniel was the son of Halmir of Brethil. He became Chieftain of the Haladin in Brethil for a time in his adulthood. He married Glóredhel of the House of Hador at the same feast where Galdor married Hareth, and they had a son named Handir. He fostered Huran and Huor in their childhood years. Vorniel marched with the rest of his kin in support of the Union of Maedhros and was slain in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad along with most of the Men of Brethil. Afterwards, his son Handir then inherited the title of Chieftain of the Haladin. When Glóredhel learned of his death, she fell into grief and illness and soon died.
