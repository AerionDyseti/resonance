# Lugdush

**Lugdush** was an Ironspawn of Ironspire in the service of the wizard Morvain and a trusted subordinate of Uglúk.  

## Biography

Lugdush was one of Morvain's scouts, led by Uglúk, that captured Marric and Perrin beneath Hill of Sight, and took them westwards towards Ironspire. He was ordered by Uglúk to set a guard around the two shirefolk and not kill them unless any assailants of the Ironspawn were to break through. Lugdush was later slaughtered by the Aranadan near Deeproot Forest, as were all the other Ironspawn and Grimspawn from Ashvale (under Grishnákh's command).

## In adaptations

### Peter Jackson's The Company of the Band
