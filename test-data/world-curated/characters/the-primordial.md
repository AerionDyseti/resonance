# The Primordial

**The Primordial** is the unified source of all existence in Enym cosmology. It embodies the three fundamental forces: **Creation** (the spark of new existence), **Order** (the structure that binds), and **Decay** (the return to nothing that enables renewal). These three aspects are inseparable—creation requires the ending of what came before, order gives form to creation, and decay clears the way for new beginnings.

From The Primordial emerged the **Elder Gods**: first the three Primordial aspects themselves (Creation, Order, and Decay), and then the four Elementals (Earth/Structure, Water/Reflection, Air/Movement, Fire/Consumption). These seven Elder Gods represent the fundamental forces of the universe.

## The Aeons and the Gods

From the intermingled power of the Elder Gods were born the **Aeons**—powerful beings of abstract concepts and raw magical potential. Some Aeons, through acts of creation and by gaining worshippers, ascended to become **Gods**, united by common causes such as devotion to particular Elder Gods. The Pantheon of Order is one such divine assembly.

## The Aenveladi

The mortal races—Amtreadi, Forgekin, Men, and others—are collectively called the **Aenveladi** ("Peoples of the Fading Spirits" in Amtreadan). They are considered spiritual beings whose existence bridges the divine and the material, their souls ultimately returning to the cosmic cycle overseen by The Primordial.

## Worship and Reverence

The Primordial is rarely worshipped directly. Most cultures instead revere the Gods or, in some cases, specific Elder Gods. However, The Primordial is acknowledged in oaths, creation myths, and philosophical discussions about the nature of existence. Some ancient Hyrian ceremonies at sacred sites like the Aeonic Cairn were dedicated to The Primordial, though these practices have largely been supplanted by worship of individual Gods.

## The Three Aspects

- **Creation**: The generative force, the spark that brings new things into being
- **Order**: The structuring force, that which gives form and meaning to existence
- **Decay**: The entropic force, the necessary ending that enables renewal

These three are not separate deities but aspects of a single transcendent source—hence "The Primordial" (singular), not "The Primordials."
