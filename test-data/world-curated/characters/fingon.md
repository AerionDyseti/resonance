# Fingon

**Fingon **the "Valiant" was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi, the eldest son of Fingalor, and older brother of Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon.

He was High King of the Ñoldor in The Mortal Lands during the First Era after the death of his father. He was instrumental in healing the rift between the Sons of Faenor and the followers of his father after their desertion of them in Araman.

## Biography
Fingon was born in The Far West, probably in Starhold where the House of Finwë was located. When the Ñoldor were resolved to return to The Mortal Lands, Fingon followed his father and his people, though they were drawn more to the ruling of their own realms and adventurism rather than vengeance and the recovery of the Starstones, as Faenor and his sons sought. He fought in the first Kinslaying but only because he, seeing Amtreadi fighting Amtreadi, believed that the Liinadi had been told to prevent the Ñoldor from leaving The Far West by force by the The Pantheon.

After Faenor's abandonment of them, Fingon and his people were led by Fingalor across the perilous Helcaraxë. They arrived in The Mortal Lands at the beginning of the First Era, and the Ñoldor witnessed the rising of the Sun.

After the Dagor-nuin-Giliath and the death of Faenor, Maedhros, Fingon's cousin and friend, was taken and hung by the wrist upon Thangorodrim. Fingon went to Thangorodrim and with the help of Thorondor, Lord of the Skywardens, found Maedhros. Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, but Fingon instead severed Maedhros's hand by the wrist, and brought him back to the Ñoldorin camp. It was this act of bravery and compassion that resolved the dispute as to whose house would rule over the Ñoldor in The Mortal Lands, for Maedhros renounced his claim to the High Kingship of the Ñoldor, instead ceding it to the House of Fingalor.

Fingalor gave Fingon a domain in Dor-lómin, in the west of Hithlum, where he did good service during the Siege of Iron Fortress, defeating an Grimspawn army that attempted to go around to the north and attack Hithlum from the west, and then later the first to fight against the wyrm Glaurung when he first came forth from Iron Fortress during the Dagor Aglareb.

Fingon became High King when Fingalor died dueling with Tenebros after the Battle of Sudden Flame. Seven years later, Tenebros's forces invaded Hithlum, and Fingon was hard-pressed and outnumbered, but Harborel and the people of the Falas, who came up the Firth of Drengist rescued them in their ships.

Fingon's final battle was the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Fingon led the attack on Iron Fortress, and the fury of his warriors nearly won the day. Unfortunately, due to Ulfang's treachery, Maedhros did not arrive until three days after he was expected. This resulted in Tenebros releasing his Flamefiends and Glaurung the wyrm on the already weakened Ñoldor force. When Maedhros finally arrived, hope was reborn for Fingon's army; however, Ulfang's treachery again took effect, causing Maedhros to withdraw. Fingon was then surrounded and his guards killed. He dueled Gorthak, the first and greatest Lord of Flamefiends, and managed to hold his own for a while. However Lungorthin, the second and lesser Flamefiend Lord emerged into amtreadi history. This Flamefiend restrained Fingon from behind with a flaming whip, allowing Gorthak to split Fingon's head with his infamous black axe. Thus the day ended in defeat for the Amtreadi.

His younger brother Turgon became the next rightful High King of the Ñoldor, even though his host retreated after the battle and remained secretly in Hidden City.

## Descendants
In the published *The Starstone Tales*, Fingon was the father of Astorion, The exact origin of *Findekáno* is not specified, but it may derive from the words *findë* ("hair") or *phin* ("skill"), and *kane* ("valour") or *káno* ("commander, lesser chief").

## Other versions of the legendarium

In earlier versions of the legendarium, Fingon had a sons called Findobar. In another account he had a son, Finbor, and a daughter, Erien.
