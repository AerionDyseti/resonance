# F

In a manuscript by J.R.R. the chronicler, a Wraithlords simply labeled "**F**" accompanied Khamûl in tracking the Shirelands-shirefolk during the Hunt for the Band.

## History
Like the other Wraithlords, "F" By  "F" and the other eight Men who had received rings of power first appeared as Wraithlords.

In , when Malachar declared himself openly to his enemies, "F" was probably one of the two Wraithlords under Khamûl's command that were sent to Dol Guldur.

In the evening of 23 September, after the Wraithlords approach near the Three-Farthing Stone in the Shirelands,

On 25 September, "F" was summoned by Khamûl with cries after failing to find Tomlen Burrows on the ridge above Woodhall. Together, they ride east over the fields and visit Farmer Turnip. After leaving Farmer Turnip, "F" was sent off by Khamûl to head down the Causeway in the direction of the Overbourn Marshes. "F" reached the Brookbury Ferry at night soon after Khamûl arrived too late to the catch the Shirefolk before they crossed the Clearbrook River.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In an early draft of *The Master of the Bands* labeled "Scheme D", the chronicler identified each Wraithlords by letters between A and I. It is not known which of these early draft labels correspond with "F". The Wraithlords trailing "the shirefolk in the Shirelands" were labeled "**D**" and "**E**" respectively.
## Portrayal in adaptations
'*1987: *The Mortal Lands Role Playing—Lords of The Mortal Lands: Vol. II*:*'
:Adûnaphel is mentioned in the supplement as one of the Wraithlords sent to Dol Guldur, as well as being the only of that group to accompany Khamûl in the Shirelands, which would likely make her "F".
