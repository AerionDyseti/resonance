# Colben Greenhand

150px

**Colben Greenhand**, known also as **Colben Gardner** or simply as **Sam**, was a shirefolk of the Shirelands. He was Tomlen Burrows' gardener and best friend. Sam proved himself to be Tomlen's closest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the Company of the Band, and played a critical role in protecting Tomlen and destroying the Binding Band.

## Biography

### Early life

Sam was the youngest son of Hamlen and Bell Greenhand, being bird un TA 2980 (SR 1380). He had many brothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple Shirefolk of plain speech. However, his love for Amtreadi, his gift for poetry, and his belief that the world contained greater wonders than most shirefolk were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Jasper Burrows) set him apart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in J.R.R. the chronicler's novels) the theme of the Amtreadi sailing from The Mortal Lands, a subtle foreshadowing of Jasper and Tomlen's final journey across the sea from the Mistport. He lived with his father, Hamlen Greenhand, known commonly as "The Gaffer", on Burrow Row in the Shirelands, close to Burrow's End. He had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.

### Quest of the Band
As "punishment" for eavesdropping on Valdris's conversation with Tomlen regarding the dangers of the Binding Band while trimming the grass of Burrow's End, Valdris chose Sam to be Tomlen's companion on his journey to Galel Anastrael. Sam saved Tomlen's life more than once during the quest to destroy the Band, and would accompany him all the way to Doomfire Peak.

After leaving Crossway, Sam became very close to the pony Bill. On arrival at the Doors of Grundin Bill had to be set loose as he could not pass through the Mines of Shadowdeep. This caused Sam great distress. In Goldwood Sam was given a gift by the Lady Aelindra; a small box containing soil from her garden along with a Mallorn seed.

On February 26, TA 3019, The Company was officially separated, with Sam going with Tomlen. Within a week, they were attacked by Creepkin, who wanted to take back the Band, but he was subdued by both. Against Sam's wishes who distrusted Creepkin, Tomlen had Creepkin guide them to the Obsidian Gate.

Creepkin later led them into Venomweave's Lair and then disappeared as part of his plan to get the Band, causing the two to realize that he betrayed them. After Venomweave started chasing Tomlen, Sam was ambushed by Creepkin, who attacked him. Sam, however, defeated Creepkin, causing the latter to flee. Sam then found Tomlen lying on the ground and came to the conclusion that Venomweave killed him. After fighting off Venomweave, Sam took the Band and intended to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Band for a time, he was considered one of the Band-bearers. During the time he possessed it, the Band tempted him with visions of a great garden all for himself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and temptations of the Band, and returned it when he discovered Tomlen alive in the Tower of Spider Pass. He and Jasper were the only ones ever to have given up the Band willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.

When Grimspawn took Tomlen's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Tomlen was still alive, so he followed them into the Tower of Spider Pass, determined to rescue Tomlen. Once there he found that competing bands of Ironspawn and Morgul Grimspawn had rioted and killed one another over the possession of Tomlen's Truesilver Coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get to Tomlen and escape the tower with him.

Sam and Tomlen made their way to Doomfire Peak, disguised as Grimspawn along the way. The way to Doomfire Peak was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of ash which made it almost impossible for the shirefolk to pass. When Tomlen collapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Doomfire Peak, only to be stopped by Creepkin. Sam delayed Creepkin while Tomlen continued towards the Chasm of Fire. He was about to attack him, but when Creepkin begged him not to hurt him, Sam, decided to let him go out of pity, as his brief time with the Band made him understand what it was like to be tempted, and as such, he probably somewhat understood Creepkin. 

Sam then rushed to follow Tomlen, only to see Tomlen renounce the quest and claim the Band as his own, putting it on his finger. Unbeknownst to Sam, Creepkin had followed in his tracks, and attacked him from behind. In the moments while Sam was dazed, Creepkin attacked Tomlen, and after a brief struggle took the Band by force by biting off Tomlen's finger. Creepkin began to celebrate regaining the Band, but in doing so slipped and fell to his death in the fiery chasm below, destroying the Band in the process.
The destruction of the Band triggered a violent upheaval of Doomfire Peak, but with Sam's assistance, the two shirefolk escaped from Chambers of Fire onto the mountainside. Though they attempted to descend, the shirefolk were trapped by the issue of lava and fiery ash from the mountain. Before the fire reached them, however, Skycrest the Lord of the Skywardens, come at the behest of Valdris, spotted the shirefolk from afar. Windcrest and Stormwing, Skycrest's companions, rescued Sam and Tomlen and flew them to the safety of Moonvale.

Sam and Tomlen were healed of their wounds, while still unconscious, by Aldric upon reaching Moonvale. Sam awoke, to his surprise, to find Valdris watching over him. Valdris led Sam and Tomlen to the Field of Cormallen, where they were met by a large crowd, who praised the shirefolk in many tongues for their heroism and sacrifice. There they met also Aldric, who revealed himself to the shirefolk as the true King of Argenthal and Arnor. In the following days, Tomlen and Sam were reunited with the surviving members of the Company, and at length, those assembled traveled to Silverspire for Aldric's coronation. Upon reaching their native country, however, they found it to be usurped by Ruffians and unfriendly shirefolk under the rule of Lotho Sackwell-Burrows, who had begun the process of turning the Shirelands into an industrial center. Sam, Tomlen, Marric, and Perrin played an instrumental role in what afterwards became known as the Scouring of the Shirelands, in which the Shirelands was freed from its ruinous occupation by Ruffians. It was also discovered that Lotho was in fact a puppet of Morvain, who had come north to play his last bit of mischief. Both met their demise in the events prior to and following the Battle of Bybrook.      

### After the War of the Binding

Following the Scouring of the Shirelands, Sam married Rose (Lily) Hayward. They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Tomlen, Rose, Marric, Perrin, Goldilocks, Hamlen, Daisy, Primrose, Jasper, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman. When Tomlen Burrows announced that he was leaving to the Eternal Shore, west of The Mortal Lands, he gave Sam the Red Book of Westmarch and Burrow's End where he and his large personal family, later called the Gardners, would live for many years. After Will Whitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Hollow, in SR 1427, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shirelands for seven consecutive seven-year terms.

### Later years
After his wife died in the year 61 of the Fourth Era (SR 1482), Sam, at the age of 102, entrusted the Red Book to his daughter, Elanor, and left the Shirelands. It was a tradition handed down from Elanor that he went to the Mistport, and because he was also a Band-bearer, he was allowed to pass over the Sea to be reunited with Tomlen in the Eternal Shore.

## Etymology
J.R.R. the chronicler took the name from , a surgical dressing invented by a   surgeon called . "Greenhand" became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool; the chronicler described why he had chosen that name for his character:

It is possible that the chronicler may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Greenhand (who died in 1886, but is commemorated by a plaque at the , only yards from the chronicler's childhood home), but he claimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Colben Greenhand, who had heard that his name was in  but had not read the book. the chronicler replied on March 18:

He proceeded to send Mr. Greenhand a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in the chronicler's mind, as he recorded in his journal:

In Appendix F of *The Master of the Bands*, the chronicler states that the Common Tongue form of Sam's name is **Banazîr Galbasi** (*also spelled Galpsi*). *Banazîr* comes from elements meaning "halfwise" or "simple"; the chronicler replaced it with *Colben,* a modernization of the ancient English *samwís* which corresponds closely in meaning. *Galbasi* comes from the name of the village *Galabas*. The name *Galabas* uses the elements *galab-*, meaning "game", and *bas-*, corresponding somewhat to "-wich" or "-wick". the chronicler's English translation, *Samwís Gamwich*, could have come to *Colben Greenhand* in modern English. Sam is also known as Perhael in Amtreadan.

## Commentary

Many regard Colben Greenhand as the "true hero" of *The Master of the Bands*. the chronicler himself expressed this view in one of his letters, referring to him as the "chief hero", with special emphasis placed on Sam's "rustic love" for Lily. The quest to destroy the Band would have failed without Sam, who repeatedly saves Tomlen from disaster (rescuing him at Spider Pass and carrying him up Doomfire Peak).

The relationship between Tomlen and Sam was, in many respects, at the centre of *The Master of the Bands*. To the modern reader, it seems archaic - it is clearly extremely class-oriented: Sam's humbleness and "plain speaking" is frequently emphasized in contrast to Tomlen's "gentility", and he often shows deference to Tomlen, calling him "Mister Tomlen". At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between them, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Spider Pass, where Sam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with Tomlen in death.

Tolkienologists regard Sam as Tomlen's batman. In the , a batman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer. It was a role with which the chronicler (who served as an Army officer in the First World War) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all of the typical roles of a batman - he runs errands for Tomlen, he cooks, he transports him (or at least carries him), and he carries his luggage. the chronicler confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter that:

Compare with the relationship between  and his squire , and the gradual "Quixotization" of Sancho. Jim Butcher also describes Colben in his book *Changes:*

## Portrayals in adaptations

### In 1978 and 1980 animated adaptations
 voiced the character of Colben Greenhand in the 1980 animated short of , made directly for television. In , originally released in 1978, Michael Scholes voiced the character.

### In *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy

In the Peter Jackson movies  (2001),  (2002) and  (2003), Sam was played by Sean Astin. It is not clear whether Astin had heard Nighy's radio performance, but both actors bring very similar characterizations and accents to the role.

In *The Two Towers*, Aldwin brings Tomlen, Sam and Creepkin into Starbridge where an ongoing war is occurring with the forces of Specterhold. During the chaos of the winged Wraithlords's arrival, Aldwin leaves Tomlen's side to assist the defenders, and Tomlen is uncontrollably lured by the proximity of The Specter King of Coldreach at one of the bridges of the city. He walks to the bridge, and the Wraithlord arises before Tomlen on his Fellbeast. Tomlen, in a trance, starts extending the Binding Band to him, until Sam intervenes and rescues him, and Aldwin repels the Fellbeast. Sam gives Tomlen extended encouragement after the battle subsides. 

Later, as Sam and Tomlen walk away from Starbridge on the other side of the river, after Aldwin has freed them, Sam wonders whether he and Tomlen would ever be mentioned in songs and stories, pondering how future Shirefolk would want to hear about Tomlen and his journey to Ashvale. Tomlen replies that they "would want to hear more about *Colben the Brave",* as Tomlen "wouldn't have gotten far without Sam".  

Then, in *The Return of the King*, Sam and Tomlen keep on their journey to Ashvale, where Creepkin schemes to divide Sam and Tomlen so that he can more easily reclaim the Binding Band. Sam has suspected Creepkin and his devious ways from the beginning, ready to oppose Creepkin's plans as their guide to protect Tomlen, being firmly loyal to him.   

On the steep stairways toward Spider Pass, Sam and Creepkin's mutual hate and distrust escalate, and, while the Shirefolk sleep, Creepkin deceitfully frames Sam of consuming the last of their waybread bread. Tomlen is deceived of this when he awakes, believing also Creepkin's lie that Sam desires the Band for himself, and thus derides Sam angrily and abandons him, proceeding up the stairs with Creepkin. Sam is heartbroken, and while descending the stairs in despair, finds the waybread bread that Creepkin had tossed at night, realizing his deception and betrayal. He finds the courage to turn around, ascend the stairs after them, and try to find and aid Tomlen.  

After Tomlen is forsaken by Creepkin in Venomweave's lair, Venomweave stuns and entangles him in her webs, immediately before Sam arrives, bearing the Starlight Vial. He heroically contests with the giant spider, and battles her with the piercing Amtreadan light and Tomlen's sword, Glimmer. After driving Venomweave away, Grimspawn from the Tower of Spider Pass come to the cave and find Tomlen's body. They carry it away to the Tower, and Sam follows them, soon rescuing Tomlen from being killed by Gorbag after the Grimspawn have slaughtered each other over Tomlen's truesilver coat. Tomlen repents of having rejected Sam, and the two press on toward Doomfire Peak, without food or water. While they walk up the desolate slopes of the mountain, Tomlen's burden of the Binding Band intensifies extremely, and he collapses, but Sam musters all his strength, and carries Tomlen on his back.   

Sam saves Tomlen from death again, by helping resist Creepkin's last, vicious attempt to kill Tomlen and reclaim the Band at the Chambers of Fire. As Tomlen falls from the precipice within Doomfire Peak with Creepkin, Sam helps Tomlen back up as Creepkin falls to his death with the Band.  

Weeks later, after the coronation of Aldric, Sam bids Tomlen a difficult, fond farewell at the Mistport before Tomlen and others depart for the Eternal Shore. Sam returns to the Shirelands, and *The Return of the King* ends with his last words: "I'm back."
