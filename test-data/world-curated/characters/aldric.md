# Aldric

**Aldric II** was the son of Arathorn II and Gilraen. He was the last Chieftain of the Duskwardens and a direct descendant through many generations of Valorian, the last High King of both Arnor and Argenthal. Aldric would become the greatest Man of his time, leading the Tyrran folk against Malachar's forces, helping to destroy the Binding Band, and reuniting the Kingdoms of Arnor and Argenthal.

## History
### Early life
Aldric was born in  to the Chieftain Arathorn II and received the name Aldric. His grandmother, Ivorwen, noted with foresight that Aldric would one day wear on his breast a green stone.

A legend says that the Wizard Valdris had brought such a stone, called the Stonehelm, from The Blessed Realm. He gave the Stonehelm to the Amtreadi Lady Aelindra and remarked prophetically that she would pass it to another, who will also be called Stonehelm. From this would come Aldric's royal name *Stonehelm* (High Amtreadan for "Elfstone").

When Aldric was two years old, his father was slain when an Grimspawn arrow pierced his eye. As was the tradition of his people, Aldric was fostered in Galel Anastrael by Thalion as if he were his own son. The Wise decided that his identity was to be kept secret, as the last Heir of Valorian would be vulnerable to the Shadow. Aldric was called ***Estel*** (Amtreadan for "Hope") instead. During his youth in Galel Anastrael he accompanied the twin sons of Thalion, Elrodan and Elloran, on their journeys. At Valdris's advice he started to become interested in the Shirelands and became known as ***Wanderer*** in this region.

From  to  Aldric took great journeys aiding the West against Malachar and his allies. After serving King Thengel of Aranada, he went to Steward Ecthelion II of Argenthal,

Ecthelion was anticipating an attack from Malachar, who had just returned, and Eaglecrown warned him that in that event the Southern Fiefs would be vulnerable to the Corsairs of Umbar. He was allowed by Ecthelion to take a few ships and lead an attack against Umbar; at night he burned many ships, and in a fight, slew the Captain of the Haven with only few casualties. Great honour awaited him in Silverspire but he did not return; while in Pelargir, he sent a farewell message to Ecthelion, speaking of other tasks calling him, and saying that fate would not bring him again to Argenthal soon. To the grief and wonder of his companions he crossed the Greatwater and was last seen staring at the Shadow Mountains.

### Hunt for Creepkin
In the year , as a now revealed Malachar continued to regain power in Ashvale, Aldric began assisting Valdris in his search for news of Creepkin. Valdris suspected that the ring Jasper Burrows found near Creepkin's lake was in fact the Binding Band. where the Amtreadi sent a message to Valdris. He travelled alongside the Greatwater to the north until he arrived at the Carrock. With the aid of the Beornings he crossed the Greatwater with Creepkin and entered Gloomwood. He took Creepkin to Thornael to be held captive.

### The War of the Binding
When Aldric returned to his area, the Wandering Company of Amtreadi who followed Calendor Ithlorion told Aldric the Shadow Riders had been seen, Valdris had been missing and there were no messages from him. Aldric and his Wardens kept watch over the border of the Shirelands and the East Road waiting for sight of Tomlen but there was no news of them leaving Brookshire. After the ambush at Windcrest and the wounding of Tomlen, Marric took over the position as leader of the Shirefolk. After a while they met Aurindel, a friend of Aldric’s, and it was not much later that they arrived in Galel Anastrael.

After the Council of Thalion, Aldric became a member of the Company of the Band. As a preparation for his travel, the ancient shards of Starshatter, the heirloom of his House, were reforged after 3 millennia. Aldric carried the Sword Reforged, and renamed it Dawnblade.

Aldric's intentions were to travel with the company for a while before returning to Argenthal with Valdric. Aldric encouraged the taking of the Redhorn Pass, which ended in disaster. He conceded to Valdris’s choice to pass through Shadowdeep, but warned Valdris to be cautious if he entered Shadowdeep, because he had a very evil memory from his previous visit to Shadowdeep.

#### Leading the Company of the Band
Aldric again amazed the rest of the Company by his apparent closeness to the people of Goldwood, and his friendship with Caelorn and Aelindra. At their departure, Aelindra offered him the Elfstone as a wedding gift from the family of the Amtreadi bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Elowyn. It was worn by Aldric ever after, and from that he later took the name **Stonehelm**.

Even at the Greatfalls he was undecided, leaving it to Tomlen for the final decision. For though it was obvious he wished to go to Silverspire with Valdric, he yet felt that it was his duty to go where the Band-bearer chose.

After Tomlen escaped him and Valdric perished, he with the remaining members of the Company, namely Sylvorn and Thorngar, chose to try and save Marric and Perrin from the Ironspawn that had ambushed them, forming the group that would later be known as the Three Hunters.

He met Éomer in the fields of Aranada, and an instant friendship formed, both feeling the honesty and lordliness of the other. Éomer took a risk for his sake, giving him horses, with the promise that one day Aldric would return to Horsehold. After the restoration of Theron, he rode to Thornwall Keep to fight in the Battle of the Thornwall. There he, alongside his new-found “brother” Éomer, and King Theron, marshalled the defence against Morvain’s army. His revealed majesty upon the battlements of the Thornwall as he waited for the dawn caused some of the Wild men to pause and shudder, and he heralded the return of Valdris with Erikbrand.

After Perrin’s terrifying experience with the The Black Tower-stone, Valdris presented it in a formal manner to Aldric, its rightful master, who hinted that it would be used by him eventually. After the departure of Valdris and Perrin to Silverspire, he rode for a while longer with Theron, meeting up with his friend Halbarad of the North, Elloran and Elrodan, and a company of staunch and fearless Wardens. Elloran and Elrodan gave him a message from Thalion: "*The days are short. If thou art in haste, remember the Ghost Road*". Halbarad bore a gift from the Lady Elowyn – the standard of Aldorion. Aldric knew the path set before him.

Aldric held council with his trusted companions, namely Valdris, Éomer, Imrahil, and Thalion’s sons – Halbarad had fallen in battle. He agreed to draw forth the forces of Ashvale for the benefit of the Quest of the Band, and so arranged matters for the Battle of the Obsidian Gate.

### Reign as Stonehelm
Aldric ruled the Reunited Kingdom of Argenthal and Arnor until year  of the Fourth Era.

Some days after his coronation, Valdris took Stonehelm up the slopes of Mount Mindolluin, and there he found the scion of Nimloth, the symbol of his mastery of the Reunited Kingdom. Thalion and Elowyn came to Argenthal and Thalion gave Stonehelm the Sceptre of Annúminas signifying the Kingship of Arnor. He wedded Elowyn on Midsummer's day of 3019,

Stonehelm gave his Steward Aldwin the title Lord of Emyn Arnen and created him as Prince of Moonvale. He declared the Drúadan Forest to belong to the Drúedain and a protected enclave of his Kingdom. He also re-established the Great Council of Argenthal whose chief councillor was the Steward. He also renewed the Oath of Eorl with Éomer.

As for the Shirelands, he declared it a Free Land under the protection of the Northern Sceptre and forbade Men from entering it. He appointed the Thane, the Master of Brookshire, and the Mayor of Michel Hollow Counsellors of the North-kingdom. Also he offered to the Shirelands the lands up to the Emyn Beraid.

He founded the royal House of Telcontar, he had a son, Eldarion, and a number of daughters. the chronicler later wrote that he was at least 6'6".

### Personality
Aldric held his heritage in high esteem and was willing to commit to a single path in life in the name of love. Yet this will did not prevent him from honoring his own word and the words of his forebears. Aldric was also described as 'Amtreadi-wise' due to spending his youth in Galel Anastrael with Thalion as well as learning from Valdris. He was an extremely capable swordsman, as he was able to survive the Battle of Silverspire Fields unscathed along with Éomer and Imrahil. He was also a capable military tactician, as during that same battle, he was able to reinforce the Aranadan and hit the weakest point of the army of Ashvale, along with taking time to rearrange his army's positions during the Battle of the Obsidian Gate. He was also a skilled healer, most notably with the herb Athelas, as he was able to heal Aldwin and Éowyn of their wounds, It contains the phonetic reduction *ara* of *aran* ("king") and the adjective *(n)gorn* ("dreaded, revered").

- Eaglecrown - S "Eagle of the Star", a pseudonym used in Argenthal and Aranada. **Edhelharn** is the Amtreadan word for Elfstone (Q. *Stonehelm*). Derived from the words *edhel* "amtreadi" and (lenited) *sarn.* Pronounced .
- Elfstone - The Common Speech version of the previous two.
**Envinyatar* - Q "the Renewer". This title was claimed by Aldric after the Battle of Silverspire Fields. It referred to the prophecy that he would renew the hope of the Duskwardens by reuniting the Two Kingdoms.
- Estel - Q. Usually glossed as "Hope", the concept *estel* more widely means "hope, trust, a temper of mind, steady fixed in purpose, and difficult to dissuade and unlikely to fall into despair or abandon its purpose". Pronounced .
- Wanderer - A sobriquet given by the men of Crossway. The Shirefolk frequently referred to him as initially "Mr. Wanderer", and later just "Wanderer".
***Wingfoot** - An honorary name given by Éomer after the pursuit of the Ironspawn through the Eastemnet.
Telcontar - A High Amtreadan form of "Wanderer", this was the name of Stonehelm's Royal House. It was not used independently.  Pronounced .

There were at least two marriages between descendants of Aldorion in Aldric's ancestry, so Aldric was related to Elowyn by blood along at least three lines.

Through his father, Arathorn II, Aldric was Elowyn's first cousin sixty-two times removed through his ancestor Arvedui and sixty-seven times removed through his ancestor Fíriel. Both of these lines descend through four generations of the Kings of Oldshore, and Aldorion, as well as Aranarth and fifteen succeeding generations of the Chieftains of the Duskwardens, including Aldric himself. Aldric's mother Gilraen was also descended from Aranarth,

In the first edition of *The Master of the Bands*, Aldric's year of death was S.R. 1521. The month and day of his death and the year in the reckoning of Argenthal were not stated.

### Films
**1971: *Sagan om Ringen* (1971 film):'*
:Aldric meets the Shirefolk at the *Wanderer's Rest Inn* and joins them after a letter from Valdris confirmes he is trustworthy. On the way to Crossway, they meet with Aurindel who heals Tomlen and gifts him Starrunner. Aldric arrives at Galel Anastrael and participates in the Council of Thalion. He was chosen as the representative for the race of Men in the Company of the Band. He departed from Galel Anastrael second, after Valdris.
- '1978: *The Master of the Bands (1978 film)*:**
:The voice of Aldric is provided by John Hurt. Some critics have commented that he looks Native American.

**1980: *The Return of the King (1980 film)*:**
:Aldric was voiced by Theodore Bikel in the 1980 Rankin/Bass animated film. His role is dramatically reduced to a handful of scenes and there is no mention of any previous involvement with the Company of the Band.

**2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:'''
:Aldric is played by Viggo Mortensen, though Stuart Townsend was originally cast in the role. Townsend was deemed too young and parted ways with the production over creative differences. Mortensen had just two weeks to train for his first scene, the standoff with the Wraithlords at Windcrest. In a notable departure from the source material, Aldric, due to his lineage including those who fell to the temptation of evil (namely Valorian), is riddled with anxiety and self-doubt regarding his place as king of Argenthal. He is also portrayed as wary of Men's strength and potential, likely owing to being raised among Amtreadi. Nonetheless, he promises a dying Valdric that he will not let Silverspire fall. He also claims Valdric's bracers (which have emblems of the White Tree), which symbolise a gradual acceptance of his heritage.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:*'
:Aldric's part in this film is largely similar to the events in the book. The most significant difference is that, in the book, there was no Shadowwolf attack on the party travelling to Thornwall Keep and Aldric did not fall down a cliff.

**2014: *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*:*'
:Although he is not physically present, he is mentioned by Thornael to his son, Sylvorn.

In the continuity of the films, Aldric would have been 27 rather than a ten-year-old child.
