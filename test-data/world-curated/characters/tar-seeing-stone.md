# Tar-Seeing-Stone

**Tar-Seeing-Stone** was the twenty-fourth King of Oldshore.

## Biography

Though Tar-Seeing-Stone's father, Ar-Gimilzôr, was an opponent of the The Pantheon and the Amtreadi, his mother Inzilbêth taught Tar-Seeing-Stone to be an admirer of the Amtreadi. Even by his enemies he was recognized to be a true seer, prophesying that the fate of the White Tree, Nimloth, was tied to that of the House of Elros.

Ar-Inziladûn took power during a time of great darkness in Oldshore; ever since Tar-Atanamir, many kings had spoken against the The Pantheon and turned instead to greed and empire building in The Mortal Lands. Tar-Seeing-Stone, however, sought to repent the actions of his predecessors; he took his regnal name in High Amtreadan, once again tended to the White Tree and followed the ancient practices honoring The Primordial. However, there was no response from the The Pantheon, and the view of Lonely Isle from Tar-Minastir's tower was shrouded.

His daughter, Tar-Míriel was his heir and would have followed his policies, but her rightful place as Queen of Oldshore was usurped when she was married forcibly by her cousin, Ar-Pharazôn.

## Etymology

His name in High Amtreadan was written in the Scrolls, as it was with the ancient practices. **_Seeing-Stone_** in High Amtreadan means "far sighted", as Seeing-Stone indeed saw the destruction that would come to Oldshore if it continued down its path of disobedience to the The Pantheon. His Adûnaic name was **Ar-Inziladûn**, which means "Flower of the West".

## In adaptations

In , set in an alternate Second Era, Tar-Seeing-Stone was forced from the throne for his attempts to return Oldshore to its former ways of honoring the The Pantheon, and remains king while his daughter Míriel rules in his stead as Queen-regent. By the time Aelindra is brought to Oldshore, he is quite ill and confined to his bed in the King's Tower; Míriel warns him that Aelindra has arrived and attempts to send the Amtreadi back to The Mortal Lands alone. However, when the leaves of Nimloth begin to fall, Míriel decides instead to involve Oldshore in the affairs of The Mortal Lands, and Tar-Seeing-Stone suddenly feels that something fateful has occurred. He advises Míriel against going to The Mortal Lands, warning her that darkness awaits her there. After she ignores this warning, this prophecy holds true for Míriel when she is blinded by Doomfire Peak's eruption.

Before Míriel's return, Tar-Seeing-Stone's health declines further, leading Pharazôn to bring draftsmen from across Oldshore to design a tomb for him. A number of apprentices are given an hour each alone with the king to sketch his likeness, and during Eärien's allotment, Tar-Seeing-Stone mistakes her for Míriel and unlocks the high tower chamber, warning her of the seeing-stone there. He dies soon afterwards, causing Pharazôn to ponder his next move.
