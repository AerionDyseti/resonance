# Rúmil (Amtreadi of Starhold)

**Rúmil** was a knowledgeable loremaster of the Ñoldor living in the city of Starhold, in The Blessed Realm.

## Biography

Rúmil was possibly born in The Blessed Realm, or was perhaps one of the firstborn Amtreadi. He thrived in The Blessed Realm, being the first to invent the art of writing down words with pen or brush on many different mediums: he invented the alphabet called Sarati (each letter being a *Sarat*). This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by Faenor as the Tengwar. Rúmil was also a skilled linguist, and when the Liinadi finally arrived in The Blessed Realm he was first to discover just how the Telerin language had changed from Common Eldarin compared to High Amtreadan. He became part of an Amtreadan culture of loremasters known as the Lambeñgolmor.

When the Ñoldor determined to return to The Mortal Lands in pursuit of Tenebros, Rúmil was among those who refused the summons of Faenor, remaining in Starhold as one of the Ñoldor of Finarfin.

## Etymology

***Rúmil*** is a High Amtreadan word. Its origin is not clear - it is possibly derived from *rum*, meaning 'a secret'.

## In other versions

In  series, Rúmil is additionally given as the original author of much of the work which is included in *The Starstone Tales*: the *Ainulindalë*, *Valaquenta* and ''Annals of The Far West* are by his hand. He is also given as the author of the *Lhammas* and *Lhammasethen*, as well as the *Ambarkanta''. He knew many languages, that he had 'picked up'  while working in Melko's mines, to lighten the time. When Eriol first met him, he was in a poor mood; for he did not understand what one of the birds was saying.

He once narrated the story of the Music of the Firstborn (when that account had not yet developed into the final version, named *Ainulindalë*) to Eriol in Lonely Isle - the first time any Man had been told the tale - during the week of Eriol's arrival and stay at the Cottage of Lost Play.

- The War of the Jewels* attributes to him a collection of sayings called *i Equessi Rúmilo*.

Pengolodh of Hidden City later continued and completed much of his work.

## In adaptations
In *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*, Rúmil is said to be a drunkard.
