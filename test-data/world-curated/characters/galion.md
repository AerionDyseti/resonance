# Galion

**Galion** was a Wood-amtreadi who served as the king's butler within the Woodland Realm of northern Gloomwood.

## Biography
Galion serves as King Thornael's butler and was likely one of his many servants. He was charged with shipping out the empty barrels of the king's cellars into the underground stream, which merged into the Forest River through the water-gate before flowing down the Long Lake to Lake-town. He was very fond of his wine. One evening in TA 2941, Galion tempted the chief of the guards into testing some Dorwinion wine with him. As a consequence, he fell asleep with the chief of the guards. This allowed the shirefolk to steal the keys and release Durgan and Company from the king's dungeon. When some Amtreadi returned from the king's feast, they found Galion and woke him up. When they noted the heaviness of some of the seemingly empty barrels, Galion ordered them to push the barrels into the water without question.
