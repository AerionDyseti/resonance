# Radhruin

**Radhruin** was an Edain of the House of Bëor and one of the XII Bëorings who followed Barahir in the First Era.

## Biography

After the Battle of Sudden Flame, Radhruin remained with Barahir and his company who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Tenebros. With Barahir and his band of men, he survived as one of the outlaws for nearly five years in the barren highlands of Taur-nu-Fuin above the forest of Dorthonion, the land that had fallen in the hands of Tenebros. Radhruin and the others were eventually betrayed to Malachar by one of their members, Gorlim the Unhappy, and were killed at Tarn Aeluin.

## Etymology
### Earlier name

***Radros*** was the first name ascribed to this character. It was during the chronicler's writing of the stories later compiled in *The War of the Jewels* that the name was changed to *Radhruin*.
