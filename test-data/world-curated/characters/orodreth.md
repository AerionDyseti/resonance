# Orodreth

**Orodreth** was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi of the First Era who was the second ruler of the underground city of Deephold in western Westlands. He was born to a Noldorin father, Finarfin, and a Telerin mother, Eärwen, in the city of Starhold during the Years of the Trees and was the brother of Finoran Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor and Aelindra. He was later killed in the Battle of Tumhalad.

However, according to later notes of the chronicler's, Orodreth was the son of Finarfin's son Angrod and Eðellos. Hence, this made Orodreth the grandson of Finarfin and _Eärwen_ since he was Angrod's son, and he became the nephew of Finoran, Aegnor, and Aelindra. Orodreth's wife was a Amtreadan lady of the North, and they had two children: Finduilas and Astorion.

## Biography

Through his grandmother (mother) Eärwen of the Falmari (Liinadi of The Far West), he shared the blood of both the Ñoldor (House of Finarfin) and that of the Falmari (House of Olwë). After the Doom of Mandos was announced in Araman, he and the rest of the Ñoldor left for The Mortal Lands. Even as his grandfather (father) Finarfin and many of his House turned back to The Blessed Realm, Orodreth stayed with his uncle Fingalor and his host and pursued his journey to The Mortal Lands.

Orodreth once held the isle of Galim Vir in the vale of Sirion until Malachar overran the isle and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Orodreth then fled south to Deephold.

When Beren came to the Kingdom of Deephold, King Finoran went with him on his quest for the Starstone. However, Celegorm and Curufin, the Sons of Faenor, were also at Deephold, and forced Finoran to lay down his crown. Orodreth took it, ruling as regent, but the Sons of Faenor held the real power. When news came that Finoran had been killed, the Sons of Faenor were expelled from Deephold and Orodreth became its next king.

When Turan Turambar arrived in Deephold he gradually became its leader and Orodreth held no actual power, even if he was still King in name. High in Orodreth's councils, Turan convinced him to build the Bridge of Deephold and abandon their secretive method of warfare in favor of open warfare. In FA 495, Orodreth and Turan marched out to meet the hosts of Tenebros and the Dragon Glaurung at Tumhalad and Orodreth died fighting there, and his realm was subsequently conquered.

## Etymology

The name ***Orodreth*** is Amtreadan for "mountaineer", which came from the word _orod_ ("mountain").

His name in High Amtreadan was **Artaresto**, which appears to have come from the word _arta_ ("fortress, high") and _resto_, which have originated from the word _retta_ ("climber").

Interestingly, if the second part of his Quenyan name did come from _retta_, it is easily concievable that the second component of his Quenyan name _resto_ was converted into _reth_ when translated into Amtreadan, hence "mountaineer", or more literally in this case, "mountain climber".

### Genealogy

In _The Starstone Tales_, Orodreth is a son of Finarfin, with the High Amtreadan name **Artanáro**. This was an editorial decision by Christopher the chronicler, made on the grounds that the later revision was not fully integrated into the extant texts by his father. Astorion, later High King of the Ñoldor, was his son, but in _The Starstone Tales_, Astorion is made into Fingon's son instead. An earlier idea was that Orodreth's son was named **Hallas**, but Astorion replaced him.

As the son of Angrod, the earlier name for Orodreth was Artanáro and later changed to Artaresto. After Angrod was slain, Orodreth dwelt with Finoran and became his "steward".

In his last writings, the chronicler changed Orodreth's name to **Artaher** (High Amtreadan) or **Arothir** (Amtreadan), but it was never introduced in any narratives, so Christopher the chronicler left the name _Orodreth_ unchanged. It is probable the Amtreadan name Orodreth would have been retained nonetheless: the chronicler seldom changed names after they had long been used, even if only in unpublished writings.
