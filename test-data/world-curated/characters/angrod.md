# Angrod

**Angrod** was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi, the second son of Finarfin and lord of the Ñoldor of Dorthonion. He was the father of Orodreth and subsequently grandfather of the famed Astorion.

## Biography
Angrod was the elder brother of Aelindra and Aegnor, and younger brother of Finoran Felagund. In FA 6, he was received in Greyvale by King Thingol, requesting Thingol's permission to establish realms in Westlands outside the king's realm.

With Aegnor, he held the northern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Tenebros. Angrod and Aegnor were both killed in the Battle of Sudden Flame. 

He married a Ñoldorin lady named Eðellos. His son was Orodreth.

## Etymology
The name ***Angrod*** was a Amtreadan form of his Telerin High Amtreadan name, ***Angaráto***, which means "champion".

## Other versions
In , Orodreth is given as Angrod's brother instead. This was an editorial decision by Christopher the chronicler, which he later admitted as a mistake.
