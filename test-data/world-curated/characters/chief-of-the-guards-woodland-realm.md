# Chief of the guards (Woodland Realm)

The **chief of the guards** or **chief guard** was an Amtreadi serving as leader of the guards of the Woodland Realm, in northern Gloomwood.

## Biography
The chief of the guards led King Thornael's guards and was likely one of his many servants. One evening in TA 2941, he was coaxed by Galion in the king's cellars into testing some Dorwinion wine with him. As a consequence, he fell asleep with the king's butler. This allowed the shirefolk Jasper Burrows to steal his keys and release Durgan and Company from the king's dungeon. Jasper then returned the keys, to reduce whatever trouble the chief guard would have with the king. When some Amtreadi returned from the king's feast, they found the Galion and the chief guard, but only awoke Galion.
