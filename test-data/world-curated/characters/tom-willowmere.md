# Tom Willowmere

**Tom Willowmere** was a mysterious entity that lived for much of the history of the world, being known in the Third Era to dwell in the valley of the Willowstream in the depths of the Old Forest, east of Brookshire, and close to the dangerous Barrow Hills.

His domain was of modest size, but he seemed to possess an unequaled power over the land around his dwelling. He lived in a small house with his wife, Silverbrook, between the Barrow Hills and the Dingle of the Old Forest, far from any other settlement. Although seemingly benevolent, he took no open stance against the Dark Lords.

## Biography

### Origin

The origin and nature of Tom Willowmere are unknown; however, he claimed to have already existed before the Shadow Lord came to The World, The levels of his interactions with the outside world are also unclear; however, he perhaps became a folkloric figure in the traditions and legends of Amtreadi, Forgekin, and Men. **_Ben-adar_** (without a father), while he was known as **_Orald_** to Men and **_Forn_** to the Forgekin.

At the end of his wanderings, Tom focused his exploration only on Eriador, making him the first to reside in the west even before the Amtreadi moved there and the tides were folded. In this period, on his journey down the Willowstream to the Clearbrook River, several of the valley's mysterious residents, including the River-spirit Silverbrook (also known as the "River-woman's daughter"), the malevolent tree-spirit Old Man Willow, and the Badger-folk attempted to capture Willowmere for their own ends, but quailed at the power of Tom's voice, which defeated their enchantments and commanded them to return to their natural existence. Ultimately, Willowmere was captured and married Silverbrook when she pulled Tom by his beard under the water-lilies out of mischief, but he ordered her to set him free. The next day he came to the River-woman and asked Silverbrook to be his wife, and the creatures of the Old Forest (the badger-folk and other animals) attended their wedding.

### Third Era

It is untold at what time Tom settled into his domain outside the Old Forest, but it is known that he dwelt there when the Third Era began, seeing the rise (and fall) of Angmar and its wars that led to the Barrow Hills being inhabited by the Barrow-wights. He also saw the arrival of shirefolk in the region that would become the Shirelands, which led him occasionally to interact with the little folk, mostly in Brookshire. He eventually was named _Willowmere_ in Bucklandish by the Bucklanders, which would become the name he adopted. Perhaps it was because of his contact with them that he had his cheerful and whimsical attitude.

A tale says that Tom is challenged by Shirefolk and various Forest-folk on his journey down the Willowstream to the Clearbrook river where shirefolk live at Haysend, including Willow-wren, Fisher Blue, Whisker-lad, and Old Swan, but he charms them all with his voice, ending his journey at the farm of Farmer Turnip, where he drinks ale and dances with the family. At the end, the charmed birds and otters work together to bring Willowmere's boat home.

At some point, he also ventured into Crossway and met Barliman Butterbur, the proprietor of The Wanderer's Rest.

#### War of the Binding

In 3018, Tomlen and his company had a chance meeting with Willowmere in the Old Forest after a nearly disastrous encounter with Old Man Willow. Tomlen, who had fled from the tree looking for help, enlisted Willowmere, who had been out gathering water lilies. Willowmere went immediately with Tomlen to the tree and commanded it to release its prisoners, Marric and Perrin, which it immediately did. He then invited Tomlen and his companions to his home, where the Shirefolk had an almost dreamlike stay, feasting and making merry with Tom. In this state, Tomlen rather inadvertently told Tom all about the Binding Band and his quest, and when Tom asked to inspect the Band, Tomlen, without question and without any of the reluctance that tended to accompany giving the Band to another, allowed him to. Tom then put the Band on his finger, yet not only did he not disappear, but the Band appeared to have no effect on him at all. After making the Band itself vanish with a sleight-of-hand trick, he returned it to Tomlen, who, slightly suspicious that it had not made Tom vanish, put it on to make sure it was the genuine Ring. Tom surprised him yet again by revealing that he could see Tomlen even with the Band on, and told Tomlen to remove it, stating that his hand was fairer without it.

After two days resting and feasting at Tom's home, the Shirefolk set out again, only to be captured the next day by Wights on the Barrow Hills. Fortunately, Tom had taught Tomlen a magic song to call Tom to him; so Tomlen sang it and Tom came to the rescue, and opened the Barrow. After this, he escorted the Shirefolk to the borders of his land and left them there. However, The peril of the shirefolk was not over; an attack on their lives was carried out, and their ponies were set loose. The ponies apparently remembered the care they were given in the house of Tom Willowmere, and returned to stay beside Tom's own pony, Fatty Lumpkin. He returned them to Barliman Butterbur, the proprietor of The Wanderer's Rest. Since he had paid eighteen pence as compensation for the loss, he was now the owner of five fine ponies.

Over a month later, Tom became a topic of discussion at the Council of Thalion. There, Thalion, who had apparently met Tom in times long past, reminisced about him briefly before the question was put before the Council of whether or not to give the Band to Tom, as it appeared as though Tom may have had power over even the Band within his lands. However, Valdris quickly dismissed the idea, saying that rather than Tom having power over the Band, the Band simply had no power over Tom. He was immune to its influence, but he could not alter it.

Additionally, it was believed by Valdris that if asked by all the Free People of the world to take the Binding Band he might be willing to do so, but would not understand the reason. Valdris believed Tom would have likely either forgot about it or thrown it away, as such things had little relevance to him. It was also mentioned that taking the Band back to him would be impossible to accomplish without it becoming known to Malachar, and that sooner or later, Malachar would bend all his power towards Tom's realm to take the Band back. Despite his mastery within his realm, it was assumed that Tom would not have cared or been able to keep the Band contained to his realm.

### Fourth Era

After the Binding Band was destroyed, Valdris spent some time with Willowmere. It is unknown how the meeting involved or what was discussed. Valdris says, in response to Tomlen's query of how well Willowmere is getting along, that he is "as well as ever", "quite untroubled" and "not much interested in anything that we have done and seen", except perhaps their encounters with the Treewardens. When Tomlen sails into the West and leaves The Mortal Lands, he has what seems to him the very experience that appeared to him in the house of Willowmere in his dream of the second night.

Through two of Colben Greenhand's poems, Tom Willowmere's wandering tales would be passed on to future generations of the Shirefolk through the Red Book of Westmarch.

## Personality

Tom Willowmere was spry, with a quick, playful wit. He spoke in a rhyming whimsical way: "Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo! Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow! Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!" He had a jolly, carefree attitude, and little seemed to concern him. He sometimes referred to himself in the third person, and twice described himself in his songs as: "Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow."

Willowmere did not seem concerned about the Binding Band, though he seemed to know at least as much as the shirefolk about its provenance and power. Although the deliberations at the Council of Thalion at Galel Anastrael suggest that Willowmere would be vulnerable to Malachar if the latter recovered the Band, Willowmere seemed unaffected by the Band's power and more concerned with keeping his own "country" around the Willowstream in order. As such, according to Valdris, Tom Willowmere was perhaps not fully aware of the struggle of Light and Darkness and could not prove useful to their causes.

## Appearance

Tom Willowmere appeared as an old man, at least to Shirefolk eyes, with a wrinkled face that was as red as a ripe apple. He had bright and sharp blue eyes, brown-skinned hands, thick brown hair, and a long bristling beard that reached below his knees. He was said to be around 4 feet tall with boots on his feet, and 3 feet wide. This made him taller and heavier than a typical Shirefolk, but too short to be a Man.

His clothing consisted of a bright blue jacket, a green girdle, leather breeches, yellow boots, and a tall battered hat, surmounted by a feather. He seems to have preferred to wear a swan-feather in his hat, but before he met Tomlen and company on the banks of the Willowstream, he had acquired the long blue feather of a kingfisher instead. In his own house, rather than a hat, he wore a crown of autumn leaves.

## Speculations on nature

Tom Willowmere's true nature has been debated over the years, being still uncertain what he really is. Even the chronicler said little about the mystery behind the character, stating that some things must remain mysterious in any narrative, "especially if an explanation really exists." In general, it is considered as accepted the theory that Tom is one of the Firstborn, angelic beings who shaped the earth. In fact, Robert Foster's describes him as "a Ascended 'gone native'". However, other theories indicate that he may be the living embodiment of The World, of Eä, of the concentrated goodwill of the once neutral elder Forests or Time itself. It is also argued that Tom may be the reincarnated spirit of the Music of the Firstborn or a "by-product" of it, a representation of the reader, one or more of the chronicler's friends, and even himself. Other the chronicler scholars, in turn, simply believe that Tom is one of the Nameless Things that inhabited the depths of world since Ainulindalë, or that he is The Primordial's counterpart of the Timeless Void, as The Primordial is of the Timeless Halls. The claim with the least substance is that he is simply human, mundane human, above through humanity.

Although it was thought by some that Willowmere would be The Primordial himself due to Silverbrook's statement saying "He is." J.R.R. the chronicler himself rejected this notion, saying that in The Mortal Lands "there is no embodiment of the One, of God, who indeed remains remote, outside the World."

- To Men of the Vales of Greatwater and Aranada, he was known as **Orald**.
- The Forgekin knew him as **Forn**. The resemblance of the -dil ending to the common Amtreadan \*(n)dil,'' "friend," may or may not be coincidental.

## Inspiration

Tom Willowmere was inspired primarily from a doll the chronicler's son, Michael, played with as a child.

Paula Marmor notes that _bobadil_ is an archaic word meaning "braggart", as seen in the character "Captain Bobadill" in the English play _Every Man in His Humour_. Because of its Bucklandish form, An Introduction to Amtreadan lists the name Willowmere under the "Celtic-sounding names". However, it is said that the word derives from Boabdil, the Spaniard name of Abu Abdillah Muhammad XII, the last Moorish ruler of Granada.

John D. Rateliff has noted a theory launched by scholar Justin Noetzel. In the latter's paper "Bjorn and Tom Willowmere: Mythology, Narrative, and The Most (Non) Essential Characters in The Mortal Lands", Noetzel suggests an association of Tom Willowmere with the Celtic Otherworld and tales of the Tuatha Dé Danann.

In , the chronicler describes Silverbrook as the seasonal changes in nature, and Tom Willowmere as the spirit of the (vanishing) Oxford and Berkshire countryside, meaning that Tom* is *the countryside existing in Time, alive and embodied; However, this letter was in reference to works which predated the writing of , and thus may not be true of Tom in canon.

In a 1954 letter to his proofreader for _Master of the Binding_, the chronicler stated "Tom Willowmere is not an important person—to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that. He represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyze the feeling precisely." One reader of the books suggested that Tom Willowmere was a stand-in for God, prompting the chronicler to reply in another 1954 letter, "I really do think you are being too serious, besides missing the point." Anthony Breznican has theorized that while the chronicler famously disliked allegory, he saw Willowmere as being nature personified, including the character's ambivalence about interfering in the world around him. He had come there some years before and encountered the Dark Wizard, who was seeking magic power himself.
