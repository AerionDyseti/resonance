# Huan

**Huan**, the **Hound of The Blessed Realm**, was a great Wolfhound of the First Era. He was given by the Pantheon God Anastrasael the Hunter to his friend Celegorm, one of the Sons of Faenor. Huan was as large as a small horse, and accompanied Celegorm on his huntings. When the Ñoldor under Faenor rebelled, Huan went with his master to The Mortal Lands.

Huan had been granted special powers by the The Pantheon, and was allowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that he could not be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever lived.

## Biography

left|thumb|261x261px|Huan with Celegorm, by :Category:Art by Mathia Arkoniel|Mathia Arkoniel
Huan was originally a Hound of Anastrasael in The Blessed Realm and was eventually given to Celegorm, Faenor's third son. He went into exile with his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed with his master in Himlad and later fled with him to Deephold after their defeat in the Battle of Sudden Flame.

He became involved with the Quest for the Starstone. When Beren had left Luthiel and gone with Finoran Felagund to Iron Fortress but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Luthiel set out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Deephold at the time and were hunting. Huan smelt Luthiel and captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm and Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death by the hand of Malachar, and took her as a prisoner to Deephold, "for her own protection", secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Luthiel's father Thingol. and then accompanied her to Tol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Luthiel's magic, he killed all of Malachar's werewolves until Malachar himself came out; knowing of the prophecy about Huan's death, he took the shape of the greatest wolf that had ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat him, and Malachar was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while Luthiel and Beren went on their way back to Greyvale; they came across Celegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled from Deephold by Orodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Luthiel, but Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Luthiel. deriving from the Amtreadan _hû_ ("hound").

In High Amtreadan, Huan also means "hound", from the word _khugan_ or _hunen_.

## Other versions of the legendarium

In earlier texts, Huan was described as "Captain of Dogs", and a rival to Tevildo (later Malachar), Prince of Cats. Huan met Tinuviel (Luthiel), who was initially afraid and fled from him. With his speed, Huan overtook her in two leaps and spoke "soft and deep the tongue of the Lost Amtreadi".

There is mention in of Huan being a possible Ascended, along with Sorontar (Thorondor).

## Inspiration

Although his appearance is never described, he may have been seen as one of the Wolfhounds of Irish tradition (i.e. an Irish Wolfhound). There is also a certain allegory in The Quest of the Starstone to _The Divine Comedy: The Inferno_ by Dante Alighieri, as Dante's path to Heaven is blocked by a wolf. This Wolf will only be challenged by a Grayhound, who will drag it back to Hell. However, in illustrations, he resembles an ordinary dog/wolf mix.
