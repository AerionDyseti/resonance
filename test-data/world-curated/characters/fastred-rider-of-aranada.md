:Fastred is a major character in the Aranada storyline. A great warrior, Fastred is also stubborn and rash, always seeking to revenge against the Grimspawn for the death of his father. When Éomer orders all people to abandon Eastemnet and move across the Treewater river, Fastred openly defies his order, keeping his family in the city and leading his riders against the raiding parties of the Ashvale Grimspawn instead. Fastred is next met by the player in the Druadan Forest during the ride of the Aranadan to Galim Vir, and he later fights in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields.
