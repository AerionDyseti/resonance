# Tar-Minastir

**Tar-Minastir** was the eleventh King of Oldshore. He was king during the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar in the mid-Second Era, he helped defeat Malachar by sending a relief force to the aid of Astorion who was under siege in The Mortal Lands.

## Biography

Tar-Minastir was the son of Isilmo and succeeded his aunt, Queen Tar-Telperiën, when she died. He was the grandson of King Tar-Súrion. His heart yearned for the west as did many in his time and loved the Amtreadi but envied them. At some point during his rule, he had a great tower built on Oromet so that he could gaze upon the west and dream.

During his rule, Malachar invaded Eriador from Calenardhon in SA 1695 and the realm of Eregion fell. Malachar advanced to Westshore and Galel Anastrael. In SA 1700, Tar-Minastir sent a naval force under the command of Ciryatur to save Westshore. Ciryatur's forces drove Malachar's army back from the Mistport and then pursued him to Tharbad, where further Oldbloods forces helped defeat Malachar at the Battle of the Gwathló. Battered but not utterly defeated Malachar retreated back to Ashvale in SA 1701 swearing revenge.

From Tar-Minastir's reign, the Oldbloods began establishing permanent settlements in The Mortal Lands.

He abdicated the throne in SA 1869, possibly not entirely willingly, dying peacefully four years later. He was succeeded by his son, Tar-Ciryatan. He reigned for 138 years.

## Etymology

The name ***Minastir*** name means "Tower-watcher" in High Amtreadan, which could be translated as "The Vigilant".

## Behind the Scenes

There is a significant discrepancy in the chronicler's writings regarding Tar-Minastir. the chronicler wrote that his reign started in SA 1731, yet he is also clear that it was Minastir that sent the fleet to the aid of the Amtreadi in SA 1700. Either the date of Tar-Telperiën's abdication or the date of the Oldbloods intervention is therefore an error.
