# Elatan

**Elatan** was a nobleman who lived in the city of Andúnië during the early centuries of Oldshore. He wedded Silmariën, the daughter and eldest child of Tar-Aldorion, the fourth King of Oldshore.

## Biography

Silmariën could have been the next ruling Queen of Oldshore but because of the law of agnatic primogeniture, she could not take the Sceptre. However, when Elatan and Silmariën had their first child, Valandil, Tar-Aldorion created the title Lord of Andúnië for his first grandson.

Elatan's descendants would figure prominently in the history of The Mortal Lands. After the Downfall of Oldshore, Aldorion, the last Lord of Andúnië, would found the Kingdoms of Arnor and Argenthal. Thousands of years later, Elatan's descendant Aldric II Stonehelm, would be a hero of the War of the Binding.

## Etymology

The name ***Elatan*** means "star-man" in High Amtreadan. It came from the words **el**, meaning "star", and **atan**, meaning "man" (usually pertaining to mortal men).
