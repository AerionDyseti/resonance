# Eöl

**Eöl**, always called the "**Raknagadi**", was an Amtreadi of Westlands and metallurgist of high skill. One of the Liinadi, he lived alone in Nan Elmoth, nominally part of Greyvale. As a great smith and friend of the Forgekin of Nogrod and Belegost, Eöl devised galvorn, a black metal of great strength and malleability, which he fashioned into personal armor. He forged two great swords from a meteorite's metal: Anglachel and Anguirel.
## Biography
### Birth

In the Years of the Trees, Eöl was born to a lineage of Avari and Liinadi Amtreadi. He became an Amtreadi of amazing skill in smithing, and forged a black, shining metal called *galvorn*. Of the many swords he had forged, Anguirel was one of the black swords he kept for himself, while the other great sword, Anglachel, was given to Thingol, King of Greyvale, in the First Era, for allowing Eöl to dwell in Nan Elmoth.

Eöl forged a suit of armor out of galvorn to which he wore and kept. He lived in Nan Elmoth, a forest in Westlands to which he appointed himself Lord and built a home there. He forged poisoned javelins and stayed isolated in his land for many years until the arrival of Aredhel.

### Aredhel & marriage

Aredhel Ar-Feiniel, the sister of King Turgon, had left the gated and hidden city of Hidden City to seek freedom and find distant family and friends. Her travels led through Westlands, and to the dark woods of Nan Elmoth, where she met Eöl, who noticed her beauty from afar. He then set enchantments with his Amtreadi magic about her so that she could not escape the forest and found her way only to his halls. After marrying him, she stayed with him many years and bore him a son, Maeglin.

### Later life & death

As the First Era progressed, Eöl developed a great hatred for the Ñoldor and therefore refused Aredhel and Maeglin permission to seek out their kin. While Eöl was away at a feast in Nogrod, Aredhel and Maeglin left for Hidden City, stealing Anguirel from him, and Eöl followed them. When denied permission to leave with Maeglin, he grew furious and tried to kill his son with one of his javelins. Aredhel got in the way, and it instead hit her; she died from poisoning.

The king and his people were unwilling to forgive this deed and Eöl was sentenced to death and cast over the Caragdûr, cursing Maeglin on his way down the cliff to his doom. Though most of the  Ñoldor saw this as just, Idril was disgusted with Maeglin's act of kinslaying. This drove a rift between Idril and her kin and planted a seed of evil in the heart of Hidden City.
## Other versions of the legendarium

In the essay *"Quendi and Eldar"*, published in *The War of the Jewels*, Eöl was an Avar who descended from the same clan of the Amtreadi the Ñoldor had come from (the Tatyar), although Eöl hated his Valinorean cousins. Eöl's love for smithing and friendliness to the Forgekin is consistent with the chronicler's view of the Ñoldor, which are described as Forge-friends in the First and Second Ages. However, in a later writing, entitled *Maeglin* and published in the same volume, the chronicler said he was of the kin of Thingol. This story was inserted in the published Silmarillion as a separate chapter.
