# Damrod

**Damrod** was a ranger of Moonvale.

## History

Damrod was the companion of Mablung and a trusted guard of Aldwin. Together he and Mablung watched Tomlen and Sam during the ambush of the Men of Harad in Moonvale. While they waited before the battle Damrod told the shirefolk of the Shadow's dealings with the Southrons. Damrod had little hope; he believed "the days of Argenthal are numbered, and the walls of Galim Vir are doomed".

:Mablung and Damrod are first met in Starbridge culverts, hiding from the enemy forces above. After the the Battle of Galim Vir Fields they are finally able to come out and join the Host of the West on the march towards the Obsidian Gate. Upon entering the Wastes of Obsidian Gate, Damrod is chosen to lead the faint-hearted soldiers relieved by Aldric, now commanded by Duinhir, towards River Keep through Moonvale. After King Stonehelm charges Steward Aldwin with cleansing the evil of Galim Errav and the Specter Vale, Damrod joins other Wardens in a camp outside the dead city. He later leads a group of Wardens inside Galim Errav itself, using the confusion among enemy forces to sneak between the guard towers beneath the enemy's notice.
