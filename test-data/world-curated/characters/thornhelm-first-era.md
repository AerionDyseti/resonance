# Thornhelm (First Era)

**Thornhelm** was the Nandorin Amtreadi and son of Lenwë. He lived during the Years of the Trees and was the first and last King of the Laegeldrim of Ossiriand.

## Biography
Hearing of the power of Thingol, Thornhelm led many of his people over the Blue Mountains to Westlands. They settled in Ossiriand, renaming it Westshore, in the east of Westlands, and Thornhelm became their king. They called themselves *Laegeldrim*, or Green-amtreadi. Sometime later, after his return from The Far West, Tenebros loosed an army on Westlands beginning the First Battle. The lightly armed Laegeldrim were driven back to the great hill of Amon Ereb, where Thornhelm was slain. The Laegeldrim became a reclusive people, seldom taking up arms, and never again naming a king.

## Etymology
The name *Thornhelm* comes from the Nandorin words dene ("strong, lithe") and thara ("tall, slender"), and gives the name a meaning of "Lithe and lank".
