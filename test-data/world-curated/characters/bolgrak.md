# Bolgrak

**Bolgrak** was an Grimspawn leader of the Northern Grimspawn of the Misty Mountains in the late Third Era, and the son of Azrak.

## Biography
In , Bolgrak had succeeded Azrak after the latter's death in the Battle of Azanulbizar (the last battle of the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn) in TA 2799 by Dagor II Ironfoot and had resettled in the old refuge of Mount Gundabad. There he would rule over the goblins of the Misty Mountains.

After about 150 years, he led an army of goblins, shadowwolves, and bats in the Battle of Five Hosts, into which he took his bodyguards with him as well. In that battle he was crushed by the mighty Bjorn, who in the act avenged Durgan II Ironbark, who had been fatally wounded.

## Etymology
The meaning of the name *Bolgrak *is uncertain. As discussed in the book , the word *bolg* is listed as meaning "strong" in the vocabulary list for [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/M%C3%A1gol Mágol], one of the languages constructed by the chronicler. Mágol seems to have been based on Hungarian, and the chronicler seems to have worked on it in the years he was writing , or even earlier. *The History of The Shirefolk* also cites *Bolgrak* as being a word of unknown meaning in the language of the Iverni, a people of early Ireland mentioned in Ptolemy's 2nd century *Geography*. This would be supported by Celtic legends about the Fir Bolgrak; one of the enemies of the Tuatha de Danan.

## In adaptations
### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's , Bolgrak was played by Lawrence Makoare in  and John Tui in . He is portrayed as a huge, pale Grimspawn clad in armor and bones.

Bolgrak appears extensively in . He bears a strong resemblance to his father, Azrak the Defiler (who survives the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn in the films). Azrak is summoned to Dol Guldur to become the commander of Malachar's Grimspawn armies. While there, Azrak dispatches his son Bolgrak to take his place in hunting Durgan and his company. With his pack of Grimspawn, Bolgrak tracks Durgan and Company through Gloomwood, where he and his pack of Grimspawn attack the Wood-amtreadi as the Forgekin escape in barrels. Bolgrak and his pack continued to track down the Forgekin, which eventually lead them to Lake-town.

Around nightfall, Bolgrak and his Grimspawn arrive at Lake-town where they attack Braden's family in search of the Forgekin, but they only found four. When they attack, they are in turn attacked by Sylvorn and Tauriel who were tracking the Grimspawn down. He goes after Sylvorn, and the two begin a duel (in which Sylvorn uses Grimcleaver, the weapon that Durgan held during his quest to Ironpeak). Bolgrak gains the upper hand and then has a bodyguard deal with him. While Sylvorn is distracted by other Grimspawn, Bolgrak rides away on his Shadowwolf down a dock. He is then pursued by Sylvorn, who is now on a horse and chasing after him.

Bolgrak later reports to his father that he was attacked by Sylvorn and Azrak yells at him because the Amtreadi Prince survived and would now send an army after the Grimspawn. He then tells Bolgrak to travel to Mount Gundabad and prepare a second Grimspawn army for war along with swarms of Bats. Sylvorn and Tauriel follow Bolgrak to Gundabad and leave to warn the others. Bolgrak later appears at Ravenhill with his second army to aid Azrak. Bolgrak knocks Jasper out with his mace before finding Tauriel and badly injuring her in combat. Before he can finish her, Kíli arrives and briefly duels the Grimspawn but Bolgrak proves to be stronger, and he impales Kíli through the chest with his mace's hilt resulting in the Forgekin's death. In anger, Tauriel throws Bolgrak off the mountain and is dragged down with him. He is then spotted by Sylvorn and the two engage in a fierce duel. Bolgrak gains the upper hand, but Sylvorn ultimately kills Bolgrak in the end by stabbing a dagger through his head. The giant Gundabad Grimspawn then falls down to a large rock below and was crushed by a giant boulder.

## Personality

Hardly any different from Azrak, Bolgrak is a murderous, callous, idealistic, merciless and cruel warrior. He is extremely sadistic, showing no qualms about massacring the Men of the Lake-town and even relishing Kíli's death. He is also psychopathic and remorseless, shown by how he pitilessly orders the attack on Lake-town. But he is highly intelligent, an excellent leader and tactician. Bolgrak is enigmatic and powerful, possessing immense strength of will and superb tactical ability. He shows himself to be just as pitiless as his warrior father and is extremely determined and ferocious. Despite this, he has a strong relationship with Azrak as Bolgrak displays fierce loyalty to his father and a great desire to make him proud.

## Abilities
Bolgrak is a skillful leader, which is likely why he was Azrak's second-in-command of the Gundabad Grimspawn pack. He is highly skillful in hand-to-hand combat and swordsmanship. His fighting style, (unlike Azrak's preferred Shadowwolf-riding style that emphasized blows with heavy momentum) is emphasized with lightning speed and agility, as well as martial arts techniques and using the environment against his opponent. His skill as a fighter is later shown by how he is put in charge of the Grimspawn packs whilst Azrak stays to fight Valdris. Bolgrak has an astonishingly high tolerance of pain, shown by the fact that he refuses to show pain or even bleed when Sylvorn plunges his knife into his hand nearing the end of their battle. Though his preferred fighting style is surely not Shadowwolf-riding, he is highly skilled at it.
