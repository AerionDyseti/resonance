## Description

Alkandros cel Tradat cuts an imposing figure at 6'2", with an aristocratic bearing that speaks to centuries of nobility. His pale skin has an almost marble-like quality, and his sharp features are framed by long silver-white hair often worn tied back with a black ribbon. His eyes, once a warm brown, now gleam a deep crimson that betrays his vampiric nature.

He favors formal attire in deep blacks and burgundies, wearing finely tailored clothing that hints at wealth while avoiding ostentation. A silver signet ring bearing his family crest is his only consistent ornament. Despite his supernatural nature, he carries himself with a reserved dignity that makes him appear more like a distinguished nobleman than a creature of the night.

## History

Born into the noble house of Tradat over four centuries ago, Alkandros was turned into a vampire during a political struggle for control of the Roarkan provinces. Initially embracing his vampiric nature, he was known for his fierce temperament and martial prowess. However, his perspective changed dramatically when he met Lysanara, an amtreadi scholar of ancient artifacts who showed no fear of him despite knowing his true nature.

Their unlikely romance blossomed into deep love, leading Alkandros to take a vow of peace and abandon the violent ways of his past. Together they had a daughter, Callidora, a miracle that defied the usual limitations of vampire reproduction. Their happiness was shattered when Solaaran forces, acting on rumors of vampire activity, raided Castle Rendakul. Despite Alkandros's attempts to protect them, Lysanara was killed in the attack.

Since that devastating loss, Alkandros has dedicated himself to protecting what remains of vampire-kind, founding the Black Hand as a secret society. He operates through careful manipulation and subtle influence, believing that survival lies in secrecy rather than direct confrontation with humanity.

## Relationships

Alkandros maintains a complex relationship with his daughter Callidora, whom he both loves deeply and sees as a living reminder of Lysanara. As the leader of the Black Hand, he has cultivated a network of loyal vampires and sympathetic mortals, though he keeps most at arm's length to protect both them and himself.

He holds a deep-seated resentment toward the Solaaran Empire, though he is careful to never let this cloud his judgment or compromise the secrecy of his organization. His position on the Council of Dukes serves as both a cover and a means to protect his people's interests.

## Goals and Aspirations

- Ensure the survival of vampire-kind through careful secrecy and strategic alliances
- Protect his daughter Callidora while respecting her independence
- Gradually build a network of safe havens for vampires throughout the realm
