# Nimrodel

**Nimrodel** was a Nandorin Amtread-maiden of Goldwood in the Third Era.

## Biography

Nimrodel had lived in Goldwood before the Liinadi and Ñoldor were seen in the forest. She was unhappy with these newcomers, thinking they would bring the turmoils of The Mortal Lands to the golden forest. She lived separately near the river that would later bear her name, and spoke only her native tongue. The only good thing she saw in Goldwood was the Sinda Amroth, King of the Wood. They both found love for each other, but she refused to marry him.

After a Flamefiend awoke in nearby Shadowdeep in TA 1980, Nimrodel grew more uneasy in Goldwood. She fled, and made her way to the edge of Deeproot Forest, but could not enter it. Amroth found her, and promised her peace. Together they travelled to Edhellond, the port city in Belfalas, and thence set sail to the Eternal Shore. They were accompanied by a small staff of Liinadi Amtreadi, including Mithrellas. All went well until they reached the White Mountains in TA 1981. The group became separated, and Amroth reached Edhellond well before the others. He decided to wait for his love aboard their ship. When a storm broke loose and swept the ship out of port, Amroth leaped overboard, hoping to swim back to shore. But he was quickly taken by Belegaer's strong currents and drowned. from the Amtreadan element *nim* ("white"). The name was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Amtreadan names such as *Amroth*, *Sylvorn*, and *Thornael*.

## In other versions

In earlier versions of J.R.R. the chronicler's tales, Nimrodel had the names **Inglorel**, **Linglorel**, or **Nimlothel**, among others. Her lover was first named *Ammalas* (later Amroth).

## In adaptations

In ,  Nimrodel was put into her deep sleep by the River-maiden of Gladden and had slept for many seasons before she awoke. After learning the fate of her beloved Amroth, Nimrodel mourned him ever, never venturing far from the Bay in which he was lost and never taking off her mourning veil. Forgoing her name of old, she became known as **Dorthaneth** and eventually became the leader of "Avorrim", a small amtreadi community lingering near and keeping watch over the now-abandoned Edhellond. In the years before the War of the Binding she visited Swan Keep and became a close friend of Lothíriel, daughter of Prince Imrahil. After the War, Queen Elowyn helps Dorthaneth to deal with her grief, causing her to lift her veil and become Nimrodel once again.
