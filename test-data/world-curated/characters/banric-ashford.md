# Banric Ashford

**Banric Ashford**, commonly known as **Bullhorn**, was a Shirefolk of the Shirelands and the hero of the Battle of the Green Fields.

## Biography
Born in TA 2704, Banric Ashford was the second son of Shirelands-thain Isumbras III, and would be the great-great-grand-uncle of Jasper Burrows. Banric was noteworthy among Shirefolk for his exceptionally large stature, being four feet, five inches tall, and his ability to ride a horse. He was the tallest Shirefolk on record until the Treewarden-draughts taken by Marric Clearbrook and Perrin Ashford made them the tallest Shirefolk in the history of the Shirelands.

Banric also gained fame for leading the Shirefolk at the Battle of the Green Fields in TA 2747 when goblins from Mount Gram in the Misty Mountains invaded the Northshire. Banric, it was said, charged the goblins' ranks with a wooden club, and knocked the goblin chieftain Golfimbul's head clean off, sending it sailing a hundred yards through the air and down a rabbit-hole, thus winning the battle and inventing the game of *Golf* at the same time.

From Banric were descended the North-tooks of Long Cleeve, where Perrin Ashford's wife Diamond would hail from. He died in the year TA 2806.
