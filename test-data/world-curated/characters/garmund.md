# Garmund

**Garmund** (late Third Era) was a man of Aranada, probably Erikbrand's lieutenant, and the leader of the garrison of Thornwall Dike.

## Etymology
Garmund is an Old English name. It is derived from the stem *gamol*, which means "old", but is only found in Old English in verse-language

Garmund is somewhat anglicized/modernized while genuinely it should be *Gameling*. It would be one of the words and names that shirefolk recognized as similar to Hobbitish (like *Swiftmane* or *Snakewhisper*).

## Inspiration
the chronicler noted that it is the origin of the surnames Gamlen, Gam(b)lin. It appears in the medieval poem *The Tale of Gamelin* (inspiration of Shakespeare's *As You Like It*)

'*1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):**
:Patrick Barr provided the voice of Garmund.

**2001-03: *The Master of the Bands* (film series):**
:Garmund was played by New Zealand actor Bruce Hopkins. His role was expanded to that of a lieutenant to Theron.

**2010: *The Master of the Bands: Aldric's Quest*:*'
:Despite the game's heavy reliance on movie audio tracks, Garmund's speech at the departure from Horsehold is not resampled, but dubbed in verbatim by Tom Kane.

'*2013: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Garmund's role is similar to that he has in the book. He welcomes Theron's host to Thornwall Keep, fights on the Thornwall Dike and on the wall of the Thornwall and after the wall is blown retreats into the Glittering Caves along with Thorngar and Éomer. Later, Garmund rides to Silverspire with Theron's riders and survives the Battle of Silverspire Fields.
