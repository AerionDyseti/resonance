# Garmund

**Garmund** (late Third Era) was a man of Aranada, probably Erikbrand's lieutenant, and the leader of the garrison of Thornwall Dike.

## Etymology

Garmund is an Old English name. It is derived from the stem _gamol_, which means "old", but is only found in Old English in verse-language

Garmund is somewhat anglicized/modernized while genuinely it should be _Gameling_. It would be one of the words and names that shirefolk recognized as similar to Hobbitish (like _Swiftmane_ or _Snakewhisper_).

## Inspiration

the chronicler noted that it is the origin of the surnames Gamlen, Gam(b)lin. It appears in the medieval poem _The Tale of Gamelin_ (inspiration of Shakespeare's _As You Like It_)

'*1981: *The Master of the Bands\* (1981 radio series):\*\*
:Patrick Barr provided the voice of Garmund.

**2001-03: _The Master of the Bands_ (film series):**
:Garmund was played by New Zealand actor Bruce Hopkins. His role was expanded to that of a lieutenant to Theron.

\**2010: *The Master of the Bands: Aldric's Quest*:*'
:Despite the game's heavy reliance on movie audio tracks, Garmund's speech at the departure from Horsehold is not resampled, but dubbed in verbatim by Tom Kane.

'*2013: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Garmund's role is similar to that he has in the book. He welcomes Theron's host to Thornwall Keep, fights on the Thornwall Dike and on the wall of the Thornwall and after the wall is blown retreats into the Glittering Caves along with Thorngar and Horsehelm. Later, Garmund rides to Galim Vir with Theron's riders and survives the Battle of Galim Vir Fields.
