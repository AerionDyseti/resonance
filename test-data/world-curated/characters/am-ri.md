__NOTOC__

**Amárië** was a Vanyarin Amtreadi of The Blessed Realm in The Far West who was loved by Finoran.

## Biography
left|thumb|Finoran and Amárië reunited, by :Category:Art by Maureval|Maureval
Finoran, son of Finarfin, was a Noldorin prince who met Amárië in The Blessed Realm. Although in love with one another, they did not marry, and Amárië did not follow Finoran into exile Helcaraxë to The Mortal Lands. According to *The Grey Annals*, this was because she was not permitted. It is noted in the Lay of Luthiel that Finoran was allowed to return to life in The Blessed Realm following his death at the hands of Malachar during the Quest for the Starstone, and he was reunited and dwelt with Amárië in The Blessed Realm.

## Etymology
- Amárië* is not given an interpretation within the legendarium. Paul Strack suggests that this High Amtreadan name contains *márië* ("well, happily; goodness, good estate, being well"). Helge Fauskanger suggests that the name might be derived from *mára* "good". Another possibility is that *Amárië* includes the element *mar* "home". Ruth S. Noel makes a similar interpretation and defines *Amárië* as "Of the Home".

## In other versions
According to a version of the legendarium following the completion of , Felagund had a wife named **Meril** who went with him into exile and became the mother of Astorion. She was sent away by Felagund along with their son to her own folk at Eglorest in the Havens of the Falas during the Battle of Sudden Flame, due to Felagund fearing that there was no hope against Tenebros. This was later changed so that Finoran had no child - with Astorion becoming the son of Orodreth, Finoran's nephew - and Amárië remaining in The Far West.
