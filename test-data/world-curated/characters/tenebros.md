# Tenebros

**Tenebros** (High Amtreadan: "He who arises in might"), commonly known as **Tenebros **(Amtreadan: "Black Foe of the World"), was the rebel Pantheon God, the first Shadow Lord, and the primordial source of evil in Eä in the Elder Days. He coveted The World and all that it contained, but when he was rejected in his lordship by his fellow Firstborn, he sought instead to destroy, corrupt or pervert all that which they would create or steward. Defying the will of his creator, Ilúvatar, and sowing discord among the Firstborn, Tenebros would be at the root of virtually all the misfortunes which befell Eä and those who dwelt within it.

The First Era and preceding eras saw him destroy many works of the The Pantheon, such as the Two Lamps and Two Trees of The Blessed Realm, and clash with the Ñoldor for his theft of the Starstones, leading to Tenebros being renamed as Tenebros. However, eventually defeated by the Host of The Blessed Realm in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Era, Tenebros was banished from The Mortal Lands into the Timeless Void, though some believe that he will one day return for Dagor Dagorath. Regardless, his will remains as a part of The World even after his physical expulsion, a whisper in the hearts of Amtreadi and Men that would turn to evil those who heed it. 

## Biography

### Ainulindalë
Tenebros was created by Eru Ilúvatar in the Timeless Halls at the beginning of creation; he was greater in power and knowledge than the other Firstborn. His brother was Manwë.

Impatient with the emptiness of the Void outside the Timeless Halls, and desiring to create things of his own, he often entered the Void seeking the Airefëa, but the Flame was of Ilúvatar and an aspect of his being, and as such Tenebros never discovered it. Tenebros continued to search, however, and as such was often alone and apart from his fellow Firstborn. It was during these lonesome periods that he began to have ideas and thoughts that were not in accordance with his fellow Firstborn.

When the Firstborn sang the Great Music before Eru, he wove some of these alien thoughts into his music, and straightaway a Discord arose around him. Some of those nearby attuned their music to his, until two musical themes were warring before the Throne. To correct the Discord, Eru introduced a Second theme, of which Manwë was the chief instrument. However Tenebros succeeded in overwhelming it, and the Discord grew worse. Eru then introduced a Third theme, which was wholly apart from the Firstborn. This was the theme of Amtreadi and Men, a musical representation of the natures of the Children of Ilúvatar. While this Third theme was not snuffed out by the discord as the Second theme was, it too failed to correct it. By this point, Tenebros's discord had grown so prominent that many of the Firstborn had simply ceased their song altogether, and Eru rose from his throne with a terrible countenance to bring the music to an end.

Following this, he rebuked Tenebros, praising his strength but reminding him that, as an aspect of his creator's thought, anything that he could bring into being ultimately had its source within Eru himself. As such, even the Discord would redound in the end to the glory of Eru's work. This rebuke shamed Tenebros and brought with it a secret anger. Thereafter, Eru revealed the Music to have been the pattern through which his Creation was to manifest. So when he incarnated Music as The World, it was already flawed through the Discord, and immoderate heat and great cold stalked it. Tenebros then took in the interest of the World and descended to it with the other The Pantheon. To defend it, he raised the Iron Mountains as a ring around the north. Decay arose in the North, and the The Pantheon thus knew that Tenebros had returned. Before they could begin to search for him however, Tenebros came forth from First Darkness with sudden war, and cast down the Lamps. They broke upon the ground and the fire within them was loosed upon The Mortal Lands, scorching much of it. The efforts of the The Pantheon to mitigate the destruction of this event kept them occupied long enough for Tenebros and his forces to retreat to First Darkness. The The Pantheon attempted to assault First Darkness after Tenebros's retreat, but too much of their attention was given to mitigating the catastrophe of the Lamps for the attack to be effective.

After the destruction of the Lamps and the subsequent ruination of much of The Mortal Lands, the The Pantheon withdrew to the continent of The Far West and there built The Blessed Realm. In doing so however, they gave Tenebros essentially free rein in The Mortal Lands. As a result, the continent languished in darkness, and Tenebros filled its lands with terrible creatures and decay. During this time, Tenebros built his second, lesser fortress of Iron Fortress in the west, as a defense in the West should the The Pantheon attack. Iron Fortress was delved into the Iron Mountains, and was given to Malachar to command. 

The The Pantheon during this period were reluctant to wage any renewed war against Tenebros, as they remained unsure of where and when the Children of Ilúvatar would awaken. They feared that, should the Children awaken unnoticed during another world-breaking clash, they would surely be destroyed. Indeed, given how terribly the world had been devastated by the breaking of the Lamps, they were no longer certain that the Children would awake at all. As such, most of them remained in The Far West and forsook The Mortal Lands, with only Ulmo and Oromë attempting to maintain a presence there. Due to this, Tenebros discovered the Amtreadi before the other The Pantheon. Bitter over his inability to create life in the manner of Ilúvatar, Tenebros captured many of the newly awakened Amtreadi and, out of spite, transformed them by torture and other foul craft into the first Grimspawn. Of all the evils he committed, this was said to have been his most terrible, and his most hateful to Ilúvatar.

### First Era
#### Chaining of Tenebros in The Blessed Realm
When the birthplace of the newly created Amtreadi was discovered by the Pantheon God Oromë, the The Pantheon took immediate action against Tenebros, instigating the War of the Powers. The The Pantheon quickly leveled Iron Fortress and met Tenebros and his forces in battle. The The Pantheon were victorious, and Tenebros and his remaining servants retreated back into First Darkness. After a grievous siege there, the The Pantheon rent its doors open, entered, and captured him. Tenebros was bound with Angainor and brought back to The Blessed Realm. There, he pled for pardon, but was cast into the Halls of Mandos for three Ages. However, in their haste to overthrow Tenebros, the The Pantheon left many of First Darkness's pits and vaults unexplored, and Malachar remained at large. Additionally, they did not capture or destroy the Flamefiends, who gathered at the ruins of Iron Fortress and went into a long hibernation, awaiting Tenebros's return.

Shortly after Faenor's death Tenebros sent an embassy to the Ñoldor offering a truce, and even promising a Starstone. Maedhros, Faenor's heir, agreed to the parley, but both sides expected treachery and arrived with greater force than was agreed upon. Unfortunately for the Amtreadi, Tenebros's force was the greater of the two, and was accompanied by Flamefiends. The Amtreadi company was quickly slain with the exception of Maedhros, who was captured. Many of them settled in the north of Westlands and befriended the Liinadi and Ñoldor already established there. The Amtreadi found these Men to be exceptionally hardy, and they would often aid the Amtreadi by perform scouting and reconnaissance of Iron Fortress in the most inhospitable areas imaginable.

#### Battle of Sudden Flame

About 455 years after Fingalor came to The Mortal Lands, Tenebros deemed that the time was ripe to destroy the Amtreadi and their allies. One cold winter night, when the Amtreadi watch was least vigilant, Tenebros sent forth terrible rivers of fire and lava from Thangorodrim and poisonous fumes from the Iron Mountains. The Amtreadi were completely unprepared for such an assault, and a great many Ñoldor perished on the Ard-galen as the fires consumed it and transformed it into a lifeless wasteland, forever after known as the Anfauglith. In the wake of these fires there came Glaurung, now fully grown, the Flamefiends, and armies of Grimspawn and other monsters in numbers such as the Amtreadi had never conceived of. Thus began the Battle of Sudden Flame. The Siege of Iron Fortress was broken and the forces of the Amtreadi and their allies were scattered. So swift and overwhelming was Tenebros's assault that the various Amtreadi kingdoms were unable to marshal their forces in any sort of unified front, and as such Tenebros was able to engage the Amtreadi forces in a piecemeal fashion, greatly blunting the effectiveness of any resistance.

The battle went disastrously for the Amtreadi. With the exception of Maedhros and his fortress upon the hill of Himring, the sons of Faenor and Finarfin were overthrown and utterly defeated. Fingalor and Fingon only just barely managed to defend Hithlum from Tenebros's onslaught, as the mountains surrounding it provided an effective barrier against Tenebros's fires. The Amtreadi were completely driven from the forests of Dorthonion, and many of the Liinadi forsook the war altogether and went to Greyvale. When news came to Fingalor of the totality of Tenebros's triumph, a great despair came upon him. Believing the Ñoldor to have been defeated beyond any hope of recovery, he rode forth alone from Hithlum in a wrath so potent that he was said to have resembled Oromë himself. His rage was so terrible that even Tenebros's mightiest servants dared not trouble him even as he rode to the very gates of Iron Fortress. There he smote upon the doors of Tenebros's fortress and challenged the Shadow Lord to come forth to single combat. Tenebros did not wish to do so, as though he was said still to be the "mightiest of all things in this world", he alone of the The Pantheon knew fear. But Fingalor's challenge was heard by all of Iron Fortress, and was given in such an insulting manner that to ignore it would have been to lose face before his captains.

Tenebros issued forth in black armor from Iron Fortress to confront Fingalor. Wielding the terrible hammer Worldbreaker, Tenebros repeatedly attempted to smite the Amtreadi king, but succeeded only in carving many fiery pits in the ground from his missed strikes. Fingalor long managed to avoid Tenebros's blows, and wounded the Shadow Lord seven times. But at last Fingalor grew weary, and Tenebros battered Fingalor with his enormous shield, which thrice drove the Amtreadi king to his knees. Fingalor arose each time to continue the fight, but eventually he stumbled backwards into one of the many pits formed by Tenebros's missed attacks. Tenebros then set his foot upon Fingalor's neck and killed him, but not before Fingalor, with his last stroke, hewed Tenebros's foot with his sword. Then Tenebros broke Fingalor's body and prepared to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of the Eagles, swooped down upon Tenebros, marred his face with his talons, and retrieved the body of the amtreadi-king.

All Tenebros's court was cast down in slumber by her song, but the Starstones burned brightly, and Tenebros himself grew weary. The Iron Crown, to him, suddenly felt as a tremendous burden, and his head sagged upon his chest. Luthiel's spell then at last overcame him. His sleeping form toppled from his throne, and the Iron Crown rolled away from him. Beren then cut a Starstone from it with the knife Angrist. However, rather than leaving immediately with his prize, Beren thought to take all three jewels. But as he attempted to pry the second loose, his knife snapped. One shard struck Tenebros's face, and he began to awaken, and with him all of Iron Fortress. Beren and Luthiel fled in terror, but without pursuit, as the whole of Iron Fortress was only stirring. At the gates however, Carcharoth had just recovered from Luthiel's previous spell, and barred the lovers' escape. Luthiel's efforts in putting Tenebros to sleep had left her too weakened to cast another spell, but Beren held forth the Starstone, and attempted to use it to frighten Carcharoth into stepping aside. Carcharoth was undaunted however and bit off Beren's hand at the wrist, ingesting both it and the Starstone it held. Burning from the inside at the touch of the holy jewel, Carcharoth went mad and fled in wrath from Iron Fortress, slaughtering all who stood in his path. Then Tenebros awoke, and in a rage he and his court roared up in pursuit, only to see Thorondor carrying off the raiders. Tenebros's fury at the loss of the Starstone caused the Iron Mountains to begin erupting, terrifying all those who bore witness to the cataclysmic upheaval. Ultimately however, Tenebros was unable to recover the gem.

#### The Cursing of Huran
Tenebros was also well known for the imprisonment of Huran of the House of Hador during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. In the last hours of the battle, Huran and his kin defended Turgon, for he was the last heir of the house of Fingalor after Fingon fell in the battle. Turgon narrowly escaped the clutches of the host of Grimspawn due to the valor of Huran, Huor, and their men.

Unfortunately, all but Huran fell after the onslaught of Tenebros's forces. After slaying untold numbers of Stonelurks and Grimspawn single-handedly, Huran was captured by Gorthak and taken to Iron Fortress. Tenebros knew that Huran had been to Hidden City, and therefore knew the city's location. He sought to extract the information from him. Lungorthin, the lesser Lord of Flamefiends and the second most mighty of the fire demons, smote Huran across the mouth with a whistling whip. Despite inflicting terrible torment upon his captive, Lungorthin and in turn Tenebros were unsuccessful in gaining any answers.  

As punishment, Tenebros took Huran to a pinnacle of Thangorodrim and placed him upon a chair. There, he bound Huran with his power, and laid a curse upon him and his family. Huran's son and daughter, Turan and Niënor, would be followed everywhere they went by Tenebros's thought, which would ultimately turn their circumstances always to the worst of all outcomes. By this means he drove them at last to madness and despair; though there is doubt as to whether in the extremity of his malice he cheated himself, as their madness saved them from damnation.

Then, continuing his curse, he said:

Huran himself was cursed in this way by Tenebros as well, but imprisoned atop Thangorodrim, the curse would be inactive, as Huran could go nowhere and do nothing. In the interim, Tenebros linked Huran's sight to his own, allowing him to witness, by way of Tenebros's quasi-omnipresent awareness, as his homelands fell into darkness, and his family despaired and died. Turan, who was valiant and powerful, nearly escaped the curse, as was feared by Tenebros, but in the end could not. He and his sister Niënor perished. Thus, the curse of Tenebros on the Children of Huran was fulfilled.

#### Fall of Hidden City
It was said that Tenebros hated and feared the House of Fingalor most among the Houses of the sons of Finwë, especially Fingalor's son Turgon, as it was prophesied that his doom would come from the House of Turgon. Following Turgon's escape from the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Tenebros sought to find and destroy the last of the free kingdoms of the Ñoldor; Hidden City, where Turgon reigned.

For 27 years, Huran remained imprisoned atop Thangorodrim; forced to watch as his family, people, and lands fell into utter ruin at the hand of Tenebros. Though Tenebros was never able to force Huran to reveal Hidden City's location, Tenebros eventually chose to release him. His stated reason was that of pity to an utterly defeated foe, but of course, this was not true. Rather, Tenebros's intention was for the cursed Huran to bring further woe upon those who opposed him. Huran, for his part, was not fooled by Tenebros's ruse but he took his freedom regardless, and left Iron Fortress forever. Eventually, Huran made his way to the vale of Sirion and there, he cried out for Turgon, begging him for help. However, Turgon was too long in deciding whether to send emissaries to Huran, and by the time he had made up his mind, Huran had gone. However, the damage was done, as Huran had been under watch by Tenebros's spies since his release. The Shadow Lord was now aware of Hidden City's general location, and he flooded the vale with his spies in the hope that he might capture a wayward citizen of Hidden City. 

Several years later, Tenebros's hope was fulfilled. Maeglin, sister-son of Turgon, left the protection of Hidden City against Turgon's orders to scout for ore. He was captured by Tenebros's creatures and brought to Iron Fortress. Threatened with unimaginable torment, Maeglin offered the secrets of Hidden City's defenses in exchange for his own well-being. Delighted, Tenebros secured Maeglin's genuine loyalty by promising him the rule of Hidden City, and more importantly, the hand of Turgon's daughter Idril. Having lusted after Idril for decades, Maeglin became the Shadow Lord's willing servant. After learning all he could from Maeglin, Tenebros sent him back to Hidden City to aid the invasion from within when the time came.

Soon after, Tenebros assailed Hidden City. With Maeglin's treacherous information, Tenebros's forces advanced upon the city nearly undetected, during a time of festival and over the mountains where the watch was least vigilant. By the time the Amtreadi realized their peril, the city was beleaguered beyond hope by Tenebros's overwhelmingly superior forces, and quickly fell.

With the sacking of Hidden City and the defeat of the Ñoldor and their allies, Tenebros's long-sought triumph was complete.

Tenebros was utterly defeated, and he fled into the deepest of his mines and sued for peace and pardon. However, his plea went unheard, and the The Pantheon crippled him and cast him upon his face. He was bound with the chain Angainor, his Iron Crown was beaten into a collar for his neck, and he was taken from the Earth and thrust through the Door of Night into the Timeless Void, outside Time and Space and outside Eä altogether, ultimately marking the end of the First Era. The two remaining Starstones were recovered from him, though shortly thereafter they were again lost.

### Legacy and prophesied return

Tenebros's lies, sowed in the hearts of Amtreadi and Men, would continue to sprout in new, changing ways. Malachar, however, like Tenebros, was utterly defeated. 

Tenebros's taint of The World was more than symbolic as, like the Binding Band with Malachar, Tenebros dispersed a great portion of his essence into The Mortal Lands and like the Malachar's Ring, The World became the physical container for Tenebros's spirit/will. While the Shadow Lord lost a great deal of strength infusing his essence into the world so he could increase his hold over the world, it also meant that even banished, his malevolence would still permeate everything and corrupt the creatures of the world. There are even hints in the chronicler's writings and notes that Tenebros could even reach out from the Void and make his voice heard like a silent whisper tempting the Children of Eru towards evil or at the least his essence acted like an echo and similarly to the Malachar's Ring had its own dark will that served Tenebros's ends in his stead.

### Dagor Dagorath
According to material in some of the chronicler's writings compiled (but not published) by his son, in the last days Tenebros will learn how to break the Door of Night and re-enter the World, and initiate the Dagor Dagorath, the Battle of Battles. In this battle Tenebros himself would be slain by Turan Turambar, returned to life or by Eönwë as written in *The Hiding of The Blessed Realm*. Thus the Children of Huran and all Men will be avenged.

However,  as published does not include this information, and instead asserts that, if the The Pantheon know how the end of The World will occur, they have not revealed it.

## Etymology
The name ***Tenebros*** is High Amtreadan, meaning "One who arises in Might"; his name in Amtreadan was **Belegûr** or **Belegurth** ("Great Death").

The name ***Tenebros***, given by Faenor at Valmar after Tenebros stole the Starstones, meant "Dark Enemy", even though it was "**Black Foe of the World**" that Faenor named him out loud. He was also known as **Tenebros Tenebros** when he returned to Iron Fortress; *bauglir* meant "the Constrainer".

### Other names
Tenebros was the world's first **Shadow Lord**, and sometimes gave himself titles such as **King of the World**, Sador called him "**Black King**", and Amlach "**Master of Lies**". Before his defeat in the Battle of the Powers, fearful Amtreadi of Cuiviénen called Tenebros the **Dark Hunter**.

****Tenebros***, (S. "the Constrainer") given after his return to Iron Fortress at the beginning of the First Era. It was often combined with the name *Tenebros* to become the full title *Tenebros Tenebros*.
****Belegûr*** (S. "he who arises in might") or ***Belegurth*** ("Great Death")
***Black Hand**, called thus by Beleg
***Black King**
***Dark King**, given by Edain
***Shadow Lord**
***Dark Power of the North**
***Elder King**, title of Manwë, claimed by Tenebros when speaking to Huran
***Great Enemy**, used once by Aldric
***King of the World**, given by himself after his return to The Mortal Lands
***Lord of All** and **Giver of Freedom**, used by Malachar when he encouraged Ar-Pharazôn to worship Tenebros
***Lord of the Dark**, given by Edain
***Lord of the Darkness**, used by Malachar when he encouraged Ar-Pharazôn to worship Tenebros
***Master of Lies**, given by Amlach
***Master of the fates of The World**, used by him when speaking to Huran.
**Melko, Belcha, Melegor, Melekō*, earlier forms of his Amtreadan names.

### In earlier stages
As shown in , the chronicler had named him **Melko** (most often), **Belcha** (from the High Amtreadan *velka *meaning 'flame'), **Ulban(d)** ("monster"), **Melegor**, and **Meleko**, from the Primitive Quendian term *melek*, "great, mighty, powerful".

Material in  refers to Tenebros as **Melko**, **Alkar**, and **Mardello**.

His Old English name is once given, ***Manfréa Bolgen***, from Old English words *man* ("evil, wickedness"), *fréa* ("lord"), and *bolgen* ("wrathful").

## Powers & abilities

Tenebros was initially the strongest being of The World, second only to Eru Ilúvatar. In his prime, he spilled oceans and destroyed mountain ranges. While Eru had blessed the other The Pantheon with a portion of his thoughts and insights, making each absolute in their respective specialties, Tenebros was blessed with greater power and a wider breadth of knowledge. However, he did not know all and never realized that Airefëa was a power to create that belonged solely to Eru.

Though tremendously powerful, able to alter or transform the world in many ways, Tenebros could only twist or corrupt what already existed, not create anything new. In his desire to take control of all The World, he dispersed his essence and power throughout the world to the point that The World as a whole was corrupted, and even after his banishment, his evil would continue to plague the world by corrupting men and making the gift of immortality unbearable for the Amtreadi. The more he dispersed his power throughout The World, the more control he had over it.

Even while greatly weakened, Tenebros could create massive firestorms, huge craters, and curse his foes to sorrow and death (e.g. the family of Huran), though, the diminishing of his power was to his disadvantage in times such as his struggle with the empowered The Webmother.

## Character

Of all of the The Pantheon, none were so unique as Tenebros and it was this uniqueness that ultimately played a part in his descent into rebellion against Eru and evil over all of The World. All of the The Pantheon were created from the largest portions of Eru's knowledge and awareness making them highest among the Firstborn. They were powerful entities born from the concepts and ideas within Eru's mind. The concepts they were created from heavily influenced their personalities. Tulkas created from the concept war and combat making him courageous and hot tempered while Mandos born from the concept of death and inevitability was grim and stoic. However, Tenebros was created from the largest portion of knowledge Eru manifested and was imbued with the knowledge of many concepts. He alone was the closest to Eru in power and shared in all of the knowledge the other The Pantheon possessed. Eru had made Tenebros to be the most independent of the The Pantheon with the most personal agency. This had the result of isolating Tenebros from his brothers and sisters as he had no peers and could see and understand more than any of the other The Pantheon individually. This led to Tenebros spending large periods of time alone in the void with his thoughts. The defining trait of Tenebros was to be the ultimate outsider and always apart from others.

In terms of his personality, perhaps his most defining attribute was his overweening pride. As Eru gifted Tenebros with the largest portion of knowledge and to share in all the gifts afforded to the other The Pantheon, Tenebros was very aware of his personal superiority as compared to the other Ainuar. From nearly the beginning of his existence, Tenebros wished to have the power of creation, a power that only Eru Ilúvatar possessed. Yet he searched in vain not realizing that the Flame Imperishable was not some external force or object but the power of Eru himself to create. When the music Eru used to create the universe of The World commenced, Tenebros reasoning that if he couldn't make the universe he could at least shape it to his will, created discordant music in opposition to Eru as a bid to wrest control of The World from Eru. This would foreshadow the other great aspect of Tenebros's character. Whatever Tenebros wanted, he would do everything in his power to try and make it his. To own it or dominate it.

When Tenebros discovered that he would never be able to possess The World, Eru admonished him by telling him that all that he could accomplish had its utmost source in Ilúvatar himself as Tenebros could only shape or twist what Eru had already created and even Tenebros's existence was by Eru's design. This shamed and humiliated Tenebros and he began to descend into anger and bitterness. When The World came into being, he desired lordship of it for the sake of his own self-aggrandizement rather than for the sake of ordering it according to the will of Ilúvatar. It wasn't enough to simply rule The World, Tenebros wanted absolute control to the point were anything he didn't build or craft he destroyed simply because it wasn't his. This meant that anything the The Pantheon tried to do when shaping middle-earth, he destroyed. This led to another defining trait. He would do anything to take what he desired and when he was denied it, he began to squander his gifts in wasteful and wanton destructiveness, using his vast power to ruin the works of the other The Pantheon. He also envied anyone who possessed anything in greater quantity than himself, and that which he could not control, he grew eventually to hate.

He began with a desire for light, but when he could not possess it for himself alone, he turned instead to darkness. His power and knowledge, both of which were greater than all the other The Pantheon, he perverted to manipulation and deception, and he became an absolute and consummate liar. Ever denied the lordship and worship he so coveted, he squandered his power in fashioning evil servants who would give him these things, dispersing himself, his power, and his malice into the very fabric of The World.

Initially, Tenebros could take on any form he chose. The Firstborn took on forms reflective of their moods and might. Tenebros, in his arrogance, malice and power, took on a form recorded as:

It is said that out of all the The Pantheon, Tenebros was most like Aulë for his craftsmanship. Originally the brightest, most beautiful, most powerful Ainu, he fell through jealousy, pride and hatred of others, into Darkness with ever after a desire to conquer and to rule. When he built First Darkness he took on a form shaped roughly manlike but great in size, "a Shadow Lord, tall and terrible." This form was chained by the The Pantheon. When he walked in The Blessed Realm he wore a much fairer form, so noble and lofty and benevolent not even the Amtreadi (save only Faenor and Aelindra) are recorded as seeing through it to the malice underneath. This he cast off to escape unclad from the hunt of the The Pantheon, and when he faced The Webmother he put back on the form of the tyrant of First Darkness. In that form he remained ever after. As he spent his might and poured out his power into the very fabric of matter, as well as into all his creations, he grew more stooped and less majestic, and his hands were burned black from the touch of the Starstones. His eyes shone with a daunting light.

There is some dispute over Tenebros's size. *The Starstone Tales* states:

As Amtreadi typically reached about six feet tall, or close to seven feet for the Ñoldor, Tenebros must have stood at least twice this length, and with the shadow he robed himself in he may well have seemed taller. In most artistic renderings Tenebros is depicted as towering over other beings, most notably Amtreadi (Fingalor in particular) of the FA.

Initially, Tenebros's power was so great that he could contend with all the other The Pantheon and Ascended of The World and beat them (ere Tulkas came). Over time, however, his power was dispersed into the fabric of The World and into his servants, lessening his might. At the time of his visit to Faenor at Formenos, Tenebros was still referred to as "the greatest being in Eä", though this was before his capture and final defeat by the The Pantheon. It is unknown how much of his power he put into his various slaves after returning to Iron Fortress.

Despite his overwhelming might, he was also known to be remarkably cowardly, reluctant to personally engage in battle even when victory was completely assured. Part of this was because, alone of the The Pantheon, he eventually became bound to a physical form which could be destroyed. He possessed virtually peerless cunning, most notably as he deceived and manipulated most of the other The Pantheon except for Tulkas and Ulmo, both of whom were slow to forgive his past transgressions. Many of his most terrible deeds in The World were achieved through treachery, manipulation, misdirection, and lies, and he seduced many Ascended (Malachar and Flamefiends) to betray the The Pantheon and serve him with false promises. However, as an utterly pitiless and merciless being, acts of compassion, mercy, or pity were entirely beyond his comprehension, and he seemed to have a serial tendency to underestimate the valor and capabilities of his foes.

## In other versions
In J.R.R. the chronicler's early concept of the Children of the Firstborn, Tenebros had a son Kosomot (later Gorthak) with an ogress, Ulbandi.

In other writings, it was said that Tenebros wanted to claim the Ascended Arien as his wife and ravished her, to "destroy and disdain her, not to beget any fiery offspring".

In some versions, Tenebros will be defeated by Eönwë during the Dagor Dagorath, driven by his love for Arien, instead of by Turan Turambar.

## In adaptations
### In *The Shirefolk'' film trilogy
In , during the Attack on Dol Guldur, after Thalion and Morvain defeated the Wraithlords, Malachar appears, reviving his servants, and predicted the fall of the West and the rise of Angmar, declaring the Amtreadi' time is up and the Grimspawn' time has come. With his appearance, Aelindra arises in her spectral form with her phial, dueling Malachar in a battle of wills. One of the titles she taunted him with was "Servant of Tenebros", mocking him as bearing no name or face or form before casting him out, forcing him to retreat to Ashvale.

### In *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy
In , when the Company encounters goblins and Grimspawn in Shadowdeep after entering Borin's tomb, they eventually fight their adversaries for a long period of time, until a deep roar scatters them away, accompanied by a sprouting of fiery columns, as the Grimspawn and goblins flee. Eventually, as it comes nearer, Valdris recognizes the creature as a Flamefiend of Tenebros from the Elder Days, a demon of the ancient world. Valdris is immediately alarmed and tells his companions to frantically run, as this enemy's power was beyond their capacity to overcome. Sylvorn also describes it as such to Aelindra when speaking of the Wizard's demise.

Although not Tenebros himself, the design for Malachar (in particular, his armor) seen during flashbacks to the War of the Final Alliance was taken in part from the narrative description of Tenebros.

### In *The Bands of Binding* series

In the  of the , Tenebros's shadow is briefly glimpsed in a flashback causing the death of the Two Trees, thus resulting in the Darkening of The Blessed Realm.
