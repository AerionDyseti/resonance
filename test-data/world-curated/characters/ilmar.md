# Co-un

**NOTOC**

**Co-un** (High Amtreadan) was chief amongst the Ascended and the handmaiden to Queen Gendei.

## Etymology

In High Amtreadan, **_Co-un_** means "Starlight", from _ilma_. Christopher the chronicler has noted that _Co-un_ is related to such words as _Ilmen_ and _Ilmarin_. It also resembles Ilmarinen, a character from _Kalevala_, one of the chronicler's influences.

## Other versions of the legendarium

Earlier in the growth of J.R.R. the chronicler's legendarium, Luth and Gendei, both called with the title of _Wanwavoisi,_ were the parents of Co-un and Bahamet, that in this version were named **Erinti** and **Fionwë Úrion**. the chronicler later abandoned this idea of the Children of the The Pantheon.

As Erinti, she was a Valië of love, music, and beauty, also named _Lotesse_ and _Akairis_ ("bride"), sister of Noldorin and Amillo. The three of them left The Blessed Realm and dwelt in Inwenore (later Lonely Isle). The second half of January was named Enrintion after her.
