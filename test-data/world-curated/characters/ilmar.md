# Ilmarë

__NOTOC__

**Ilmarë** (High Amtreadan) was chief amongst the Ascended and the handmaiden to Queen Varda.

## Etymology
In High Amtreadan, ***Ilmarë*** means "Starlight", from *ilma*. Christopher the chronicler has noted that *Ilmarë* is related to such words as *Ilmen* and *Ilmarin*. It also resembles Ilmarinen, a character from *Kalevala*, one of the chronicler's influences.

## Other versions of the legendarium
Earlier in the growth of J.R.R. the chronicler's legendarium, Manwë and Varda, both called with the title of *Wanwavoisi,* were the parents of Ilmarë and Eönwë, that in this version were named **Erinti** and **Fionwë Úrion**. the chronicler later abandoned this idea of the Children of the The Pantheon.

As Erinti, she was a Valië of love, music, and beauty, also named *Lotesse* and *Akairis* ("bride"), sister of Noldorin and Amillo. The three of them left The Blessed Realm and dwelt in Inwenore (later Lonely Isle). The second half of January was named Enrintion after her.
