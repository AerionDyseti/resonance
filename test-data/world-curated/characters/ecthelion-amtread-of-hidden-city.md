# Ecthelion (Amtreadi of Hidden City)

**Ecthelion**, or **Ecthelion of the Fountain**, was a mighty lord of Hidden City in the First Era of The Mortal Lands, and one of its greatest heroes. 

## Biography
### Early life
Most of Ecthelion's early life is unknown, though he may have lived in The Far West and as one of the followers of Fingalor. It is known that he passed through the dangerous Helcaraxë and lived. After surviving the grinding ice, he fought in the Battle of the Lammoth and Dagor Aglareb. As a follower of Turgon he settled in Vinyamar in Nevrast before moving to Hidden City in FA 116. He later became the Lord of the Fountains.

### Aredhel's escort
Two hundred years after Hidden City was wrought, Ecthelion, Aurindel and Egalmoth, along with the White Lady of the Ñoldor left the Hidden City due to Aredhel's yearning for the freedom she once had in The Blessed Realm. Their orders were to lead her towards Hithlum, where she would meet her elder brother Fingon. When coming upon the Ford of Brithiach, Aredhel ordered them to turn south, for she desired to see the Sons of Faenor. Thus, Ecthelion and his companions arrive North Greyvale and sought admittance to Greyvale, but the wardens refused them entrance inside the Girdle of Melian. Having no other choice, they took the dangerous road between the haunted valleys of Ered Ashplain. Near Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, the riders were caught in a mesh of shadows and they were lost from Aredhel. In vain, they sought her afterwards, but the fell offspring of The Webmother that dwelt in that place pursued them. Barely escaping alive, the three lords returned to Hidden City without the princess, where they were received in sorrow.

### A Lord of Hidden City
In the year, FA 473 Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon in the battle Nírnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Hidden City's forces. Upon the defeat of the Ñoldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.

Twenty-three years after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë of Hidden City traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil through the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them as Warden of the Great Gate.

Ecthelion initially denied passage for Tuor but when Tuor made a reference towards Ulmo, the Lord of the Waters, Ecthelion eventually allowed him entry.

He was the lord of the house of the Fountain, one of the twelve houses of the Gondothlim. His people were fond of diamonds and silver, and their array was beautiful to the sight. In FA 510 during the Fall of Hidden City, Ecthelion led his house into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.

### Warcry of the Eldar
In the battle over Hidden City, Ecthelion and his forces made their entrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in reserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the swords and the killings, which followed, that his name became a terror among the enemy and a Warcry to the Eldar. Valiantly fighting side by side with Tuor and his house of the White Wing, they drove away the Grimspawn until almost the Gate was regained. As Dragons reinforced Tenebros's army, Ecthelion killed two dragons and three Flamefiends. Outnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm was wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they joined the remaining leaders in the Place of the Fountain.

In that place, the great Fountain of the King stood and Ecthelion regained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons led the enemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Hidden City began its last stand. Ecthelion and some amtreadi corner a fire drake. Ecthelion pushes the drake towards the fountain and kills it by making it fall into the fountain. Finally all were overcome but Ecthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand, which was remembered as the most valiant "in all the songs or in any tale". It was there that he faced Gorthak, Lord of Flamefiends.
