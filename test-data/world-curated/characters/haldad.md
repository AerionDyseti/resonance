# Haldad

**Haldad** was a leader of the Haladin in Thargelion.

## Biography
During his leadership, a swarm of Grimspawn assaulted his people. He created a defensive stockade between the two rivers Gelion and Ascar and where he was besieged by Grimspawn. They exhausted their food supply, and Haldad led a sortie against the Grimspawn, only to be slain. His son, Haldar, was also slain while trying to retrieve his body. His daughter, Haleth, led the Haladin through another week of starvation until one of the sons of Faenor, Caranthir, came with his army and rescued them.
