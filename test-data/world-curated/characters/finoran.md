# Finoran

**Finoran**, known fully as **Finoran** **Felagund**, was a Ñoldor Amtreadi who was born in The Far West. He was King of Deephold and the eldest son of Finarfin and Eärwen, and the brother of Aelindra, Angrod and Aegnor. Finoran was one of the noblest Amtreadi of the House of Finarfin and a friend of Men. His nobility, death saving Beren, and opposition to the Oath of Faenor allowed for his return to life in The Blessed Realm, making him the first Amtreadi to be reincarnated in the Eternal Shore before the end of the First Era.

## Biography

Finoran was friendly with Turgon and the House of Fingalor. He opposed Faenor and the Oath when he sought to return to The Mortal Lands to recover the Starstones from Tenebros, but chose not to be parted with his friends and so he followed his father and his House and the House of Fingalor. Finoran did not fight in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë nor was he aware of it as he continued the transit through Araman. While marching up the coast, the host encountered a figure on a rock and heard the Prophecy of the North. Afterwards, Finarfin and many of his followers departed and returned to Starhold, but Finoran chose to continue onto The Mortal Lands with the host of Fingalor.

Finoran founded the original Silverspire in the Pass of Sirion. In around FA 50, he and his friend Turgon, while journeying down the river Sirion, encamped along its banks and were put to sleep by Ulmo. While asleep, Ulmo revealed to them the hidden caves of Deephold and the Vale of Tumladen. Finoran discovered the system of caves beneath the Taur-en-Faroth, and with the help from the Forgekin of the Blue Mountains he started to build the city of Deephold and went on to found his own kingdom there. Finoran rewarded the Forgekin with many jewels from The Blessed Realm. And in that time they made for him the Nauglamír and gave him the honorific Felagund meaning  "Hewer of Caves".

While hunting in the lands of Thargelion in East Westlands, Finoran was first of the Ñoldor to come across Men. He stayed with them long, learning their language and teaching them Amtreadan. He also intervened on behalf of the Laiquendi of Ossiriand, who feared Men would destroy their home, and he received the permission of King Thingol, who held overlordship over all Westlands, to guide the Men to Estolad.

Finoran had a close friendship with Andreth of the House of Bëor, whom he often visited during the Siege of Iron Fortress to converse with her on the matters of Amtreadi and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as *Athrabeth Finoran ah Andreth*.

During the Battle of Sudden Flame, Barahir of the House of Bëor saved Finoran's life, and in friendship Finoran gave him his ring. This ring was later known as the Band of Barahir and was eventually handed down to Aldric when told of his true identity. Years after the Battle of Sudden Flame, Barahir's son Beren came to Deephold seeking help, and Finoran went with him on the Quest for the Starstone to repay his debt, laying down his kingship. Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Deephold at the time, persuaded (using fear of Tenebros, and barely veiled threats related to their Oath) most of Deephold to stay behind; only ten warriors, headed by one, Edrahil, were faithful and accompanied their King.

Though disguised by the arts of Finoran, the twelve were captured by Malachar and taken to Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Silverspire, the castle Felagund himself had built. Finoran and Malachar battled with songs of power but despite a great display of skill and power by the Amtreadi prince, Malachar eventually caught him in a devious trap and prevailed. But Malachar could not discern who exactly they were, even though they were revealed to him. Malachar imprisoned them, seeking to learn their errand and identities, sending a werewolf to devour them one by one until they revealed their secret, yet none did. Malachar however perceived that Finoran was a High Amtreadi Lord of great power, and purposed to save him for last. Eventually, when the wolf came for Beren, Finoran burst his chains and killed the wolf barehanded but was mortally wounded himself. It is noted in the *Lay of Luthiel* that Finoran was soon allowed to return to life in The Blessed Realm and "now dwells with Amarië" and was described as walking "with Finarfin his father beneath the trees in Eldamar".

**Felagund** is an Epessë given to him by the Forgekin that expanded the caves of Deephold. It is actually of Dwarvish origin (or Sindarized Forgespeech) from the word *felak-gundu* ("Hewer of Caves").

Finoran was also called by Bëor and his people **Nóm** ('Wisdom'), **Nómin** ('the Wise'), and "Friend-of-Men", which in Amtreadan was *Edennil* and *Atandil*, Amtreadan and High Amtreadan respectively. while Men called him **Sômar** or **Vidri**, both meaning 'Wisdom'.

## In other versions
In earlier versions of the The Mortal Lands mythology, and the first edition of , the name *Finoran* was given to the character later known as Finarfin. Finoran Felagund was then named "Inglor Felagund". Because of that, some people speculate that Calendor Ithlorion was Finoran's son, but there is much evidence to the contrary, which is found on the page for Calendor Ithlorion.

In , Orodreth is Finoran's brother. This was an editorial decision by Christopher the chronicler and an admitted mistake. Orodreth was actually the son of Angrod and thus Finoran's nephew.

## In adaptations
### *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*

Finoran is portrayed in  by Will Fletcher. He appears in the series' prologue sequence, in which he gives counsel to his younger sister Aelindra when she is a child. Thereafter he is shown to have fought in the war waged against Tenebros. After Tenebros's defeat, he began hunting Malachar, though he was killed by servants of Malachar in "a place of darkness and despair". This leads Aelindra to take on his mission and his dagger, which she uses throughout this endeavor until sacrificing it to be melted down in order to forge the Three Bands of the Amtreadi. Shortly before this, Malachar takes on the appearance of Finoran in a vision to Aelindra as he attempts to sway her to his side.
