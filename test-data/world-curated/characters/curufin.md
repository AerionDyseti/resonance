# Curufin

**Curufin** was a Noldorin prince and one of the seven sons of Faenor. Along with the other sons of Faenor, he swore the Oath of Faenor, joined the Exile of the Amtreadi, and settled in East Westlands.  

He was Faenor's favorite son, and resembled him greatly in skill, temperament, and appearance. He was also the father of Celebranor, master jewel-smith of Eregion, who forged the three Amtreadan Bands of Binding. 

Curufin was almost always in the company of his brother Celegorm, and the pair are most notable for their role as antagonists in the story of *Beren and Luthiel* where they made foiled attempts to usurp the kingdom of Deephold, force Luthiel into marriage to coerce a political alliance with the kingdom of Greyvale, and even attacked Beren and Luthiel directly. 

Their misdeeds resulted in the weakening of the Union of Maedhros, which contributed to the disastrous outcome of the fifth battle of Westlands, Battle of Unnumbered Tears (*Battle of Unnumbered Tears*).

Curufin, alongside his brothers Celegorm and Caranthir, was eventually killed when he and the rest of his brothers attacked Greyvale in an effort to reclaim the Starstone held there.

## History
### Life in The Blessed Realm

**Curufin** was a Noldorin prince, one of the seven sons of Faenor and Nerdanel, born in The Blessed Realm during the Time of the Two Trees. He was Faenor's favorite son, and he greatly resembled Faenor in temper, talents, and appearance. At some point he married and had a son, Celebranor.

Faenor and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but travelled far and wide upon the confines of The Blessed Realm, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. Often they were guests in the halls of Aulë. 

During the unrest of the Amtreadi and the strife between Faenor and his half-brother Fingalor, Faenor was banished from Starhold and took up residence in Formenos; he was followed by his father, King Finwë, and his sons.

Along with Finwë, the sons of Faenor did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Tenebros and The Webmother after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses and lay upon their faces, blind and without strength. Once the cloud passed and they could move again, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Starstones stolen.

They then sped to the Band of Doom where Maedhros informed Manwë and, unknowingly, also Faenor who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Faenor reacted by cursing both Tenebros and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Faenor followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.

Faenor and his sons soon returned to Starhold where during a great speech by Faenor, they took a terrible and blasphemous oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dares to claim any part or right in the Starstones, and led most of the Amtreadi into exile.

To obtain the ships needed to pursue Tenebros into The Mortal Lands, Faenor's host seized them from the Falmari, killing many when they resisted, and thus came under the Doom of Mandos.

After a long march northwards, the Amtreadi drew close to the Helcaraxë, a land bridge deemed impassable, and the narrow strait between The Far West and The Mortal Lands they intended to sail. With too few ships remaining to ferry all the Amtreadi at once, and the fear of treachery between their houses, Faenor and his sons stole away in them, abandoning the host of Fingalor.

While Curufin's son Celebranor joined him in exile, his wife had refused to take part in the rebellion of Faenor and remained in The Far West with the people of Finarfin.

### Return to The Mortal Lands

After landing at the Firth of Drengist, and burning the ships to prevent any from sailing back, Faenor's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim where they were attacked unaware by a host of Tenebros. In the battle that followed, Faenor's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed grimspawn over the Shadow Mountains into Ard-galen.

Though Tenebros's assaulting forces were destroyed, Faenor recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant grimspawn, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of Dor Daedeloth. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Maedhros was taken captive after feigning to treat with Tenebros. 

The hatred between the houses began to be assuaged in , when Maedhros was rescued by Fingalor's son Fingon, and two years later the Amtreadi held a great common council where Fingalor was chosen to be overlord of the Amtreadi. Maedhros subsequently waived his claim to the title, and shortly after relocated the House of Faenor to East Westlands. In , Fingalor held the great Feast of Reuniting where the Amtreadi houses, both Amtreadi and Liinadi, pledged common cause against Tenebros.

### Establishment in Himlad
Curufin and his brother Celegorm held and fortified the realm of Himlad, including the Pass of Aglon. This was situated between King Thingol's realm of Greyvale, Maedhros' realm at Himring, and Eöl's realm of Nan Elmoth.

Curufin had a good relationship with the Forgekin, and he bore the knife Angrist, made by the forgekin Telchar of Nogrod, which he wore sheathless by his side. 

Eöl, however, Curufin loved not at all. Curufin was aware of Eöl's resentment towards the Amtreadi, and that Eöl was using his friendship with the Forgekin of the Blue Mountains, which Curufin was jealous of, to stir up unfriendliness against them. Regardless, Eöl was still allowed to cross through East Westlands, though a constant watch was placed on Nan Elmoth as they mistrusted his doings and goings.

### Encounters with Aredhel and Eöl

In , while Celegorm and Curufin were riding with Caranthir in Thargelion, their cousin Aredhel, daughter of Fingalor, arrived at Himlad. The people of Celegorm welcomed her and bade her stay among them with honour until their lord’s return. 

She expressed to Curufin, and later to Celegorm of whom she was most fond, that she escaped from Hidden City of her own will and was glad to dwell with them and be free. The brothers considered sending a message to her brother King Turgon to inform him, but delayed as the route was extremely perilous, she was happy, and Turgon would have demanded her immediate return. Before they could make up their minds though, Aredhel disappeared, having unknowingly crossed into Nam Elmoth during her restless wandering. It was a long time before they knew what happened to her, but they eventually learned once their scouts starting sighting her visiting the borders of Nan Elmoth, or straying beyond them. They chose not to report this to Turgon to avoid his wrath. and the Pass of Aglon was taken, though with great cost to the hosts of Tenebros. Celegorm and Curufin hardly escaped, and passed westward along the north borders of Greyvale, with such mounted following as they could save, and came at length to the vale of Sirion. 

Shortly after, Celegorm and Curufin also had to withdraw, and they were harboured in Deephold gratefully, the griefs between the House of Finarfin and House of Faenor now forgotten. and Celegorm and Curufin grew to strong power, leading many of them. Beren arrived at Deephold seeking aid on his quest to retrieve a Starstone from Tenebros to present to King Thingol of Greyvale; this was the bride-price named by Thingol for Beren to wed his daughter, Luthiel. Finoran's life had previously been saved by Beren's father, Barahir, and in gratitude he had sworn an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Barahir and his kin. Among Finoran's people only his ten most faithful companions remained willing to join him, and he left his crown to Orodreth to govern in his stead.

Sometime after, evil wolves started to cross the river Narog and entering the Guarded Plain, leading Celegorm and Curufin to hunt them, joined by their riders and Huan, Celegorm's great hound of The Blessed Realm. While on the hunt, Curufin secretly spoke to Celegorm of Orodreth being a "dullard slow" and laid out a plot where they could usurp the throne of Nagrothrond in the event of Finoran's death. With no rumour or tidings of Finoran, Curufin suggested that Celegorm should feign another hunt, but with the actual intent to seek out Finoran; through this they would then either confirm his death, or, if by some grace he was alive and bearing a Starstone, they could kill him and reclaim it before he returned. Either way, the throne would then be theirs as the eldest house among the Amtreadi. Celegorm listened, but said nothing.

On the third day of their hunt, they had reached near their borders to the west of Greyvale and Huan discovered Luthiel and brought her before Celegorm and Curufin. She revealed who she was and of her escape from Greyvale in order to rescue Beren, whom she had learned from the visions of her mother Melian was being held prisoner in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Finoran's former fortress of Silverspire now occupied by Malachar. Celegorm, immediately enamoured by her beauty, and Curufin both listened, and gave no indication of their awareness of Beren or his quest. Once Luthiel finished, she besought them for their aid. In private counsel, Curufin explained to Celegorm that they now knew that Finoran had been taken prisoner, where the wolves were coming from, and what answer he should give to Luthiel. Celegorm then addressed Luthiel and told her that their hunting party wasn't adequate to assault such a fortress, but that if she came back with them to Deephold, they would then devise aid to rescue Beren. Thingol in wrath had sent their letters back by his own servants to Orodreth. 

Though Celegorm attempted to still the clamours of the people, they grew to calls for the brothers to be slain. Brought before Orodreth, Celegorm stood unbowed with scorn and a menacing anger, while Curufin smiled, though wary-eyed and hand on the haft of his knife. Curufin then laughed and, addressing Orodreth as "Sir Steward", noted that they were not accustomed to standing in his hall and requested to know what he sought of them. Orodreth, speaking coldly, stated that they now stood before the king and that they were banished from Deephold, and there would never again be love between the realm and the sons of Faenor. Celegorm and Curufin soon departed and they went alone as none of their people would any longer follow them; even Curufin's son, Celebranor, repudiated his fathers deeds and remained behind. Huan, however, still followed his master Celegorm. Additionally, the wounding of Beren caused only half of the House of Haleth that dwelt in Brethil to come forth, and they joined Fingon and Turgon in the west instead of Maedhros. In retaliation, Celegorm and Curufin vowed openly to slay Thingol and destroy his people if they were victorious and the Starstone (now in Thingol's possession) was not then freely surrendered to them.

## Characteristics
Curufin was Faenor's favorite son and resembled Faenor very much in face. He alone showed in some degree the same temper and talents, and was the chief inheritor of his father’s skills. He was known to be of perilous mood,

At the burning of the ships in Losgar, Curufin is the only specifically named individual of the "few of those most close to Faenor in obedience" who was aroused by Faenor in setting them aflame. Of all the sons of Faenor, Curufin is the only one noted as not preferring to use his mother-name. A margin note on the passage of their wolf-hunt states that ''"it is Curufin who put evil into Celegorm's heart"*.

## Other names
Curufin had the sobriquet of "the crafty". ("Skillful Finwë"), the same father-name given to Faenor. Because Curufin was Faenor's favorite son, he chose to give him the same name. The short form of this name was ***Curvo***.

His mother-name was ***Atarincë*** ("Little Father"), referring initially to his physical resemblance to his father, and later also found in his mental likeness.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*, in the tale of *The Nauglafring*, Curufin goes as a representative of the sons of Faenor to Dior to bid him to turn over the Starstone, set within the Nauglafring, in his possession. Dior refuses on the grounds that he could not endure such a despoiling of the Nauglafring, to which Curufin then states that the Nauglafring unbroken must then be given over.  This rises Dior to anger, who bids Curufin to be gone and to instead seek the other two Starstones still with Melko (Tenebros). As in *The Starstone Tales*, the sons of Faenor then attack Dior's realm, but instead of Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin being killed in the battle, here it is Maglor, Dinithel (Amras), Celegorm, and Cranthor (Caranthir).

In third volume of *The History of The Mortal Lands*, there are many differences in both the events and portrayals of Celegorm and Curufin from the published *Silmarillion*. 
-  In *The Lay of the Children of Huran* Christopher the chronicler summarizes the multiple shifts of the founding of Deephold of which include Celegorm and Curufin founding it after the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and another where they found it after they are routed when Tenebros breaks the Leaguer of Iron Fortress, and continue to remain in the east after their host is defeated in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.
-  In *Lay of Leithian Canto VIII* when Curufin and Celegorm come across Luthiel, it is Curufin instead of Celegorm who is enchanted by her. and through that love were even uniquely granted passage to sail with the House of Faenor after the ships were seized.

In *Maeglin*, from the eleventh volume of *The History of The Mortal Lands*, Celegorm and Curufin more directly assist Aredhel and Maeglin in their escape from Eöl: Celegorm first provides them with swift horses, and the brothers then waylaid the East Road and its ford over Aros, denying its use to Eöl and delaying him until he escaped them that night in the darkness.

In *The Tale of Years* from the same volume, it was Celegorm and Curufin instead of Beren who intercepted and defeated the Forgekin of Nogrod at the Battle of Sarn Athrad, and were greatly angered to find that a desired Starstone was not within their treasure looted from the battle in the Thousand Caves. However, Christopher the chronicler comments that this idea was evidently abandoned by his father, since the older idea of Beren fighting the Forgekin and being aided by the Treewardens appeared again in the Letter 247.

While in the published *Silmarillion* Curufin is recorded as the fifth son of Faenor, in *The Shibboleth of Faenor* he is the fourth.
