# Tar-Ancalimon

**Tar-Ancalimon** was the fourteenth King of Oldshore. He succeeded his father, Tar-Atanamir.

## Biography

During Tar-Ancalimon's reign, the people of Oldshore became divided and two opposing parties arose among Oldbloods: the Amtread-friends, or *Elendili* (also called "The Faithful"), advocated continuing devotion to the The Pantheon and friendship with the Amtreadi, and the "King's Men" who opposed the Ban of the The Pantheon and friendship with the Amtreadi, advocating Oldshore's independence and self-determination, seeing how they had reached the apex of their might.

During his time, the Amtreadi tongues were discouraged and were no longer taught to Oldbloods children. The royal titles however were still taken in High Amtreadan out of respect for ancient customs rather than love for the Eldar. The Skywardens which had formerly nested in an eyrie in the King's Palace in Armenelos, were no longer fed during his reign and departed. His policies would later contribute to the Fall of Oldshore.

Tar-Ancalimon ruled for one-hundred and sixty-five years and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Telemmaitë.

## Etymology

The name ***Ancalimon*** means "Most Bright" in High Amtreadan.
