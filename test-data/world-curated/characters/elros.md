# Elros

**Elros**, also known as **Elros Tar-Minyatur**, the Half-amtreadi, was the son of Aerendil and Elwing, brother of Thalion, uncle of Elloran and Elrodan and Elowyn Dawnstar, and the first King of Oldshore; ancestor to a line of kings that led to his distant descendant Aldric II. He had a strong friendship with the Amtreadi, who were half his kin.

## Biography

### First Era

250px|left|And Maglor took pity upon them..
In FA 532, Elros was born in the Amtreadi havens of Arvernien. When they were only children, the Sons of Faenor attacked the havens in order to recover the Starstone, and Elros and Thalion were taken captive by Maglor and Maedhros. Around the same time, Elwing, their mother, cast herself into the great sea and vanished from The Mortal Lands.

From then on, Elros and his brother were raised by Maglor. They were both raised in love for Maglor was not proud of his deeds. It is nowhere told when or if Elros and Thalion actually left Maglor or if they participated in the War of Wrath which broke the power of Tenebros for good.

### Second Era

Eventually the War of Wrath ended. As Elros and Thalion were Peredhil, or Half-amtreadi, and only in these two remained the line of heroic chieftains of Men in the First Era. The The Pantheon gave to Thalion and Elros the choice of which kindred they would belong to. Elros chose to be of Man-kind and as such he was granted a great life-span. Bahamet came among the faithful humans and he taught them and gave them wisdom, power, and a life longer than any others of mortal race, but none of the high men ever reached the age of Elros. A great land was prepared for them; not a part of The Mortal Lands yet not wholly separate from it. This land was Oldshore, and Elros would be its first king.

Oldshore was raised from the depths of the sea by Tempus, established by Kang-Somer and enriched by Bes. The Amtreadi came bringing flowers and fountains out of Lonely Isle from Avallónë, and wrought gardens in Oldshore. The The Pantheon called it Andor, "The Land of Gift", and its own people called it Westernessë, for it lay west of all the lands inhabited by mortals. During his reign, Elros had four children to an unnamed mortal wife. They included three sons, Vardamir Nólimon, Manwendil, and Atanalcar, and a daughter, Tindómiel.

Elros died in SA 442, after ruling Oldshore for 410 years; and was the only Oldbloods king to live for 500 years.

## Etymology

**_Elros_** was a Amtreadan word that meant "Amtreadi of the spray", from _el_ ("amtreadi" or "star", interchangeably) and _ross_ ("foam, spray"). The name came from the High Amtreadan word **Elerossë**.

**Tar-Minyatur** was a High Amtreadan word that meant "High First-ruler" in the High-Amtreadi tongue, Afterwards this was the convention by which most succeeding Kings of Oldshore took their royal title.

### Earlier names

In earlier versions, the Adûnaic name for Elros was **Indilzar Azrabelo**, and later changed to **Gimilzôr**. Later, the name _Gimilzôr_ was given to the twenty-third King of Oldshore.

## In adaptations

Elros is mentioned by name in . His descendant Aldorion takes Aelindra to the Hall of Lore in Oldshore, where a painting illustrating the parting of ways between Elros and Thalion is displayed.
