# Celebranor

**Celebranor** was a Ñoldorin prince and the last in the line of the House of Faenor, who lived in The Mortal Lands. He was a ruler of Eregion in the Second Era, and a master smith. He is remembered primarily for his creation of the Three Bands of Binding: Band of Water, Band of Air, and Band of Fire, but also he made the second Elfstone (in one version of history) for Aelindra, who would later give it to Aldric.

## Biography

### First Era

Celebranor was the son of Curufin, who was the fifth son of Faenor (son of Finwë and his first wife Míriel) and Nerdanel. In the First Era, he fought in the battles of Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Dagor-nuin-Giliath and Dagor Aglareb. After fighting in the Siege of Iron Fortress, Battle of Sudden Flame, Battle of the Pass of Aglond and Fall of Tol Sirion, he lived with his father and uncle in Deephold, staying even after Curufin's exile. After fighting in Battle of Unnumbered Tears, he fought in Sack of Deephold, and then escaped and traveled to Hidden City. He fought and survived the Fall of Hidden City and Third Kinslaying. Celebranor finally fought in the War of Wrath. Unlike some of his kin, he remained in The Mortal Lands afterwards.

### Second Era

Celebranor settled in Eregion in the Second Era and started dealing with the Forgekin of the realm of Shadowdeep. In SA 1500, Malachar, calling himself _Annavar_ ("Giver of Gifts"), befriended the Ñoldor of Eregion. He claimed to be an emissary of the The Pantheon, especially Kang-Somer, and instructed them in the art of ring-making. Celebranor distrusted him, but the smiths of Eregion were deceived. Under the guidance and instruction of Malachar, the smiths openly made rings to learn the craft and Celebranor himself forged the three Amtreadi rings without assistance from Malachar. But unbeknownst to him, the craft taught by Malachar incorporated a binding magic into the rings.

Malachar retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm. Celebranor was captured in the chaos and was forced, under torture, to disclose the locations of the lesser rings, but he would not reveal the whereabouts of the three greatest of them that he had sent away for safekeeping. Celebranor died from his torment; his body was shot with arrows and hung upon a pole, and was later paraded as a banner when Malachar attacked the Mistport.

## Character

Unlike both his father and grandfather, Celebranor was selfless and kind, and neither prideful nor covetous of what he created. He was described to have an "almost Dwarvish obsession with crafts";

## In other versions

In early accounts, Celebranor was a Liinadi Amtreadi instead, an ancestor of the minstrel Daeron who used the Fëanorian script. Later, Celebranor was changed to a Ñoldo who had served Turgon in Hidden City and survived the Fall of Hidden City.

In , a statement claims Celebranor to be one of the Liinadi who accompanied Caelorn to exile.

Another earlier version had Celebranor revolting against Aelindra after she and Caelorn established Eregion. Celebranor and Aelindra were later reconciled once Malachar's trickery was revealed.

## In adaptations

### Video games

Celebranor appears in the video games and , as the wraith assisting the Warden Talion in destroying the forces of Malachar. Here, he assists Talion due to the guilt he feels for creating the Bands of Binding, thus feeling responsible for the trouble The Mortal Lands is in. However, the Celebranor that appears in the game differs from the chronicler's creation in that he not only makes the three Amtreadi rings, but he crafts all of the Bands of Binding, and when captured helps Malachar reforge the Binding Band (via the inscription of the lettering of the Band upon it) and assists him in creating the Wraithlords by accompanying Malachar to the men who eventually would become the Shadows; he also gave the Band a will of its own. However, once Malachar's intentions were revealed to him, he stole the Binding Band and used it to command an army of Grimspawn and Ironspawn to fight Malachar and lay claim over Ashvale. However, using the Band, Celebranor is revealed to have developed a superiority complex and an insane obsession with taking everything from the dark lord for himself, so much so, that even Malachar himself could see the darkness within his heart, going so far as to believe that Malachar had already killed his family and was lying that he would spare them. In a final battle, Celebranor used the Band's power to defeat Malachar. However the Band wanted to return to the Shadow Lord, and so it slipped off of Celebranor's finger and onto Malachar's, breaking Celebranor's control over his Grimspawn army. Captured by Malachar, the amtreadi was then tortured as punishment, such as witnessing his family tortured and killed in front of him, before finally being beaten to death by Malachar with Túrann, Celebranor's own Truesilver hammer.

When the game takes place and the protagonist, Talion, is slain in a blood-ritual, Celebranor is bound to the Warden, which allows Talion to return from the dead (in addition to many other abilities). He has no memory of his past, not even remembering his own name until they find an artifact that belonged to him (with the assistance of Creepkin,) and with each artifact they find more of his memory is restored. Creepkin eventually abandons them, leaving them to find the last artifact in The Ashdeep on their own. They also assist a low ranking captain named Ratbag advance through the ranks until he advances to Warchief, and kill all other warchiefs (leaving Ratbag in charge of all the Ironspawn in The Ashdeep), which leads to his apparent demise after he is blamed for failing to prevent the destruction of a monument to Malachar by the Hammer of Malachar, a Black Captain and a lieutenant of the Black Hand of Malachar (the leader of the Ironspawn in Malachar's stead). Talion (and Celebranor) is approached by Lithariel, the daughter of Marwen, Queen of the Tribesmen of Núrnen, who claims her mother has summoned Talion to her chambers.

Their job finished in The Ashdeep, they make their way to Núrnen and have an audience with Queen Marwen (who looks similar to King Theron when he was enchanted by Morvain), who gives them another artifact from Celebranor's past.

This artifact gives the wraith and his host their key to confronting the Black Hand: branding. They begin building their army by branding the captains and warchiefs of Núrnen (and optionally The Ashdeep), thus enabling them to confront the Black Hand at his fortress of Ered Glamhoth, the strength of his forces depending on how many warchiefs and captains he branded. They return to the queen to tell her they are prepared to leave when suddenly the Queen begins forcing Celebranor out of Talion, saying that they can defeat Malachar "together." As Talion dies, he tells Lithariel, Marwen's daughter, to break the Queen's staff, and when it breaks, the Queen becomes youthful again, and reveals she went to the Greycloaks Morvain for assistance in helping her people survive Malachar's onslaught. Celebranor suspects that Morvain may have gone rogue, and may be desiring the One for himself. Marwen nonetheless assists Talion by acquiring them a smuggler, which they use to go to the Black Hand's fortress.

When Talion enters the fortress, a skeleton bound to a pole by rope begins talking directly to Talion, and Celebranor reveals that the Tower of Malachar, another Black Captain and the Black Hand's right hand, is responsible for this, and thus is here in the Black Hand's stead. Talion approaches the Black Hand's throne, and as he looks for the Tower, the Black Captain appears in the throne, and reveals the Black Hand went looking for Talion. He addresses Celebranor directly, telling him Malachar forgives him and, if he casts off that "corpse" and becomes one with him, he will have his dreams fulfilled. Celebranor rebukes the Tower, saying that Talion and the wraith will never surrender.

Failing to deceive Celebranor, he reveals to Talion that the Ringmaker deceived Talion by pretending that the Black Hand of Malachar placed a curse on them, binding them together, where in reality Celebranor chose Talion as his "host" and could have released him at any time. Talion insists that the Tower stand up and fight, to which the Tower obliges. He creates illusions of himself, forcing Talion to drain the illusions to sap the Tower of his power.

After the illusions are eliminated, Talion hears his wife Ioreth singing, and when he gets close to her, his wife is revealed as the Tower, who attempts to brand Talion. However, the Warden overpowers him and brutally kills him, stabbing him with his son's dagger, Acharn, four times in the heart, before shoving his sword, Urfael, into the Tower's laughing mouth. After the Tower's death, Talion reveals his anger at Celebranor for his deceit, saying he wanted to be with his wife and son instead of being alone alive. Celebranor points out though that the Warden wanted revenge, and thus he gave him the means to do so. The Ringmaker does admit that he can leave Talion, if he wants. Yet before they can part ways, the wraith says that they must finish what they started by killing their true target: the Black Hand. Talion reluctantly agrees, and the pair set sail for Núrnen once more.

However, they find the Queen's palace sacked, and blood on the throne. The queen's crown, however, was left, and when Talion picks it up, another set of Celebranor's memories are returned to him. They figure the Black Hand has them in The Ashdeep, preparing an exchange for Celebranor for the Queen and her daughter. They arrive in the now-dark, ashed filled The Ashdeep, where they find the Black Hand's elite guards standing watch for the duo. When the Talion arrives at the Obsidian Gate riding a Caragor, his branded Ironspawn and warchiefs are already fighting the rank and file Ironspawn. Then finally, with a warchief and a set of captains, the Talons of the Black Hand reveal themselves, along with a host of rank and file Ironspawn. To Talion's sadness, The Talons reveal that they slaughtered all of the Núrnen tribesman, including Lithariel and Queen Marwen. After a brutal fight, the Talons are defeated, and the remaining branded Ironspawn that assisted Talion remain behind to fight the Black Hand's forces. Meanwhile, the Gravewalker climbs the Obsidian Gate, and find the Black Hand waiting for him. Then quite subtly, the Black Captain lures the wraith duo in and unleashes a blast of energy that gives Celebranor more of his memories: his confrontation with Malachar in the fields of The Ashdeep ending in failure, the return of Malachar's ring, and the brutal murders of Celebranor's family before his eyes, before being murdered himself. This gives Celebranor more power as a result. The Black Hand tells Celebranor that when he originally performed the blood ritual in an attempt to absorb his spirit into the Black Hand's corporeal form (thus reforming an avatar of Malachar, though he would not be at full strength), he gave him a choice: to stand by Malachar's side. He then tells the grave-walker duo that Talion and Celebranor have no choice in the matter, and surprisingly performs the blood ritual on himself, absorbing Celebranor into the Black Hand and forming the avatar of Malachar. Malachar tries to kill the already dying Talion, but as Malachar is about to deliver the finishing blow, Celebranor uses his energy to temporarily stun Malachar. This gives Talion the chance he needed to kill the avatar of Malachar, and thus the Black Hand, with his sword.

Talion relieved that he has finally exacted vengeance for his family, sees Celebranor waiting, ready to go to the afterlife together. Talion, however, insists that together they should use their powers to combat Malachar, because they both know as long as his Ring exists, he will return again, no matter in what form. Celebranor insists that fighting Malachar is mortally impossible, because he tried once long ago and it couldn't be done. Talion asks the Ringmaker if he could die knowing there was chance that they could defeat Malachar, but they didn't take it. Celebranor simply disappears, and doesn't answer. Talion, looking at The Ashdeep's red sun, declares to himself and the wraith that it's time for them to forge new ring, as his eyes glow with the wraith's power.

The two then travel to Doomfire Peak, and proceed to forge a New Ring. Upon its completion, Celebranor is separated from Talion by Venomweave, and Talion takes the new ring to survive without the wraith. He later finds him in Venomweave's Lair within Spider Pass, and gives her the new ring in exchange for Celebranor. The Amtreadi wraith dislikes this exchange however, but Venomweave's natural powers amplified by the ring prove to be too strong to fight, and thus the duo shifts their attention to a new target: the seeing-stone in Tower of Moon.

After the city's eventual fall, Malachar sends 8 ringwraiths to force the new ring from Venomweave. Realizing the danger that keeping the ring would cause to both her and to The Mortal Lands, she returns the ring to its forgers. The ranger and the wraith then proceed to Nurnen, where they use the ring's power to build an army and take over the region; Subsequently, they are betrayed by an ally in the process, only to exact revenge on him with utter cruelty. Of course, Celebranor's cruelty hints to Talion that the ring's power is starting to affect the amtreadi's sanity.

Eventually, after conquering most of Malachar's domain, defeating a Flamefiend with the help of Carnan, a nature spirit, and finding out the identities of some of the Wraithlords, the duo takes their army and march towards The Obsidian Spire, only to be stopped by one of the ringwraiths, Valorian. Upon his defeat, Talion decides to end the fallen hero's torment, and permanently kills him. However, Celebranor considers this an act of betrayal; he reveals that his plan has gone from simple revenge to tyranny, as he plans on brainwashing Malachar and ruling The Mortal Lands through him. As Talion objects to this plan, the wraith abandons the Warden's body and takes over Eltariel's, leaving Talion to bleed to death.

As Talion picks up Valorian's ring, he becomes a wraithlord and decides to take back Galim Errav, whilst Celebranor and his new host face Malachar. Eventually, Malachar, in his Annavar form, finds himself on his knees, and Celebranor begins to dominate him. But in a sudden moment of resistance, Malachar pulls out a blade and slices off Eltariel's fingers, just like Valorian had done to him centuries earlier. With Malachar now having the upper hand, he consumes the wraith, but with adverse effects; rather than one consuming the other, they both joined to become the flaming Eye of Malachar, locked into a battle of wills. Their unending struggle for dominance lasted over the entire course of the War of the Binding until the Binding Band was destroyed in Doomfire Peak, wherein Malachar's power was finally broken.

However, Celebranor did not fade from The Mortal Lands as Malachar did. Like the Shadow Lord, the Bright Lord had poured his own life force into forging his Ring, which had been taken by Eltariel on command of Aelindra. Thus, Celebranor's spirit was freed from The Obsidian Spire as it collapsed and fled to parts unknown. Soon, the New Ring started expressing a desire to return to its creator, much like the Binding Band, and Eltariel planned to find him.

Celebranor is voiced by Alastair Duncan.

#### _The Master of the Bands Online_

In , Celebranor appears in several flashback sequences, depicting his encounter with the "Giver of Gifts", the initial idea of creating the Bands of Binding, and his final doomed stand during the Sack of Eregion.

### _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

Celebranor is a significant character in the first two seasons of Amazon Studios' series , portrayed by Charles Edwards.

left|thumb|360px|Celebranor details his plans for a new forge
Celebranor is first seen introduced to Thalion by Astorion in Westshore; already a master artisan. Thalion accompanies Celebranor back to Ost-in-Edhil, in Eregion, where Celebranor shows him his grandfather Faenor's hammer, and tells him of his own desire to create something truly significant. This requires a forge greater than any yet built; one which the Amtreadi have not the ability to make. Thalion, because of his friendship with the Forge-prince Grundin IV, volunteers to attempt forging an alliance between Eregion and Shadowdeep. Celebranor walks with Thalion to Shadowdeep's West-gate, but Thalion ventures in alone.

Thalion eventually is able to negotiate an agreement with Grundin IV and his father, Grundin III, and work on the proposed forge soon begins. Upon Thalion's return to Ost-in-Edhil, Celebranor remarks on Thalion's likeness to his father Aerendil, and how Aerendil once foresaw Celebranor's fate to lie in Thalion's hands one day. The two then realize that Grundin IV has started to avoid them, and Thalion travels back to Shadowdeep, where he learns that the forgekin-prince has discovered a new ore, which he calls _truesilver_.

After a meeting arranged by Astorion in Westshore, Thalion allows Celebranor to examine a small fragment of truesilver. Celebranor is enthralled by its beauty and resiliency, and expresses the belief that by mining vast quantities of it, the supposed remnant of light from a Starstone contained in the metal could stave off the impending doom for Amtreadi that Astorion, and he had discovered.

After Grundin III refuses to mine for truesilver, Thalion returns to Eregion and is resigned that the Amtreadi must leave The Mortal Lands, though Celebranor still desires to try to use the small fragment Thalion had acquired. Aelindra unexpectedly arrives in Ost-in-Edhil with a wounded Halbrand, who, unbeknownst to the Amtreadi, is Malachar in disguise. Malachar soon recovers and comes to Celebranor's forge, where he learns of truesilver and makes critical suggestions on how to amplify its restorative properties. This catches Celebranor's attention, and soon Malachar has the Master-smith's trust as they attempt to forge a creation that will prevent the Amtreadi from fading. Aelindra becomes suspicious when Celebranor repeats several phrases said by Adar to be from Malachar, and though she soon discovers Halbrand's true identity, she withholds this knowledge from Celebranor so that the forging can continue. At Aelindra's suggestion, Celebranor forges three rings instead of the initially proposed two, and is satisfied with his new creation.

Astorion, in Westshore, has learned from Aelindra that Halbrand is Malachar. He sends an urgent letter to Celebranor informing him of this news. The messenger is killed on the way and never arrives. Halbrand arrives at Ost-in-Edhil and asks to see Celebranor. The latter has promised Aelindra not to speak to the king of the Southlands again and leaves him at the door.

Celebranor, shows Mirdania his assistant, his new invention with the Truesilver, the Ithildin, which shines only in the light of the moon. He finally goes to see Halbrand and orders him to leave. Halbrand manipulates him. He makes him believe that he has seen Aelindra, that the Rings have saved the Great Tree and the Amtreadi, but that Astorion has not even bothered to warn the master blacksmith. Finally, Celebranor brings him in. Halbrand asks him to make Rings for Men, but when Celebranor refuses, he tells him that he is in fact sent from the The Pantheon to counter the Shadow. Halbrand suddenly disappears and then reappears in the fire in the form of Annavar. By further flattering Celebranor's ego, calling him the Master of the Binding, Celebranor will finally agree to forge rings for the Forgekin.

Grundin and Disa are received by Celebranor and Annavar, who offer to forge Bands of Binding to heal the mountains of the forgekin, who have suffered from earthquakes, in exchange for Truesilver. The offer was made to them rather than to the king, because the blacksmith knew that he did not like outside help. Grundin is skeptical, suspicious of the Rings, and he doesn't like Annavar. Disa ends up convincing him of the emergency to save Shadowdeep who has no more food.

Annavar tricks Celebranor into believing that Astorion has forbidden the making of any more Rings, and flatters the Blacksmith's vanity. The latter takes the bait. He writes to his king that he is closing the great forge, but is going to make the Rings for the Forgekin. It is the ultimate goal of his life, his masterpiece.

Grundin III, having no solution for his kingdom, accepts the offer and brings the Truesilver to forge the Seven Bands. He gives it to Celebranor, but Annavar takes it from him and holds it in his clenched fist before adding it to the molten metal and starting to forge the new rings.

Celebranor celebrates with Narvi the creation of Grundin's Gates in Ost-in-Edhil. Annavar looks troubled. He argues with the blacksmith, he suffers for the men and asks for Rings for them. The blacksmith doesn't want to, men are too easily corruptible, and even helped Adar. Annavar tells him about the great men of the First Era, and that they can find good and noble men in the kingdoms of The Mortal Lands or Oldshore. Celebranor says no, Annavar accepts him, he will forge the Rings without him.

In the forge of Ost-in-Edhil, there is panic, tools are flying. Celebranor comes running. Annavar explains to him that he made a ring with more Truesilver, to limit the risk of corruption in men, and that when Mirdania tried it on to check the size, she disappeared. He would like the master blacksmith to help him not to make any mistakes. Following a flying hammer, Celebranor grabs his apprentice and removes the ring. Grundin IV arrives just at this moment and wants to see the lord of the place. He informs the blacksmith of his father's strange behavior since he has the ring, he has become greedy and irritable, forgetting his past caution. Celebranor explains that they used the same process as for the Amtreadi Rings, which work very well. Grundin suggests that the problem may be with Annavar.

Celebranor goes to see Annavar, to find out if anything happened during the creation of the Rings of the Forgekin. Annavar replies that he didn't do anything himself, but that they created the Rings with their minds polluted by Celebranor's lying letter, telling the High King that he will not forge new rings. Celebranor does not want to denounce himself to Astorion, whose wrath he fears.

Celebranor decides to forge the Shadows Bands of Men with Annavar, to balance those of the forgekin. They have to be perfect and even threaten these assistants with expulsion if they make the slightest mistake. Annavar reassures them afterwards, explaining that the blacksmith is overwhelmed by the importance of the Rings. Despite his doubts, Celebranor begins to forge the Shadows.

He can't forge the Rings of Men, and they have no Truesilver left. He is very irritable and can't remember the name of his protégé. Annavar then shows up with a request from citizens who want to speak to their lord. Celebranor confides in him that he is tired and confused, but that the Rings come first. Annavar takes charge of the administration of the city and the supply of Truesilver.

At Ost-in-Edhil, the enemies were finally seen and the alarm sounded. There is panic in the city. Annavar cuts his hand with a knife and goes up to see Celebranor. The latter, who is working on The Rings of Men, wonders the nature of the noise he hears outside. Annavar tries to hold him back, but the blacksmith wants to get off and see what happens. Malachar then casts a spell and when Celebranor comes out of the tower, he sees the city by day where everything seems idyllic. Annavar hands him the hammer of Faenor, he explains that the Bands of Binding will be his life's work and that they will eclipse the Starstones in the memory of the amtreadi. He gives him the little Truesilver he has obtained. Celebranor climbs back into his tower to continue his work, for a final try. As soon as the blacksmith disappears, the reality of the panicked night city returns. Annavar smiled at the chaos to come.

left|thumb|200px|Celebranor on his balcony.
Celebranor remains in the grip of the spell, which forms a mind prison, and quietly forges the Shadows Bands of Men with the Truesilver brought back by Annavar. Outside, it is the chaos of war, the city is in flames and ruins. To Captain Malendol, Annavar tells that Celebranor has ordered not to counterattack, but that they will disobey and that the troops must be prepared. Mirdania is outraged by her lord's attitude, but Annavar confides in her that he has lost his mind.

When he goes back to see the blacksmith, he understands that time runs in a loop. Annavar admits that it is his work and the discussion becomes heated. Celebranor then asks him who he really is and throws Faenor's hammer at him, which breaks a window. The blacksmith finally hears the sounds of war and discovers the damage in his forge. He inadvertently spills the Truesilver, but it is black blood and not metal. Annavar shows him his slashed hand and the dark blood that flows from it. Celebranor finally understands that he is in front of Malachar.

He rushes to warn Mirdania, who disbelieves him. To further discredit Celebranor, Malachar, still in his guise as Annavar, manipulates Celebranor against his will into flinging Mirdania from the rampart to the Grimspawn below. A large Grimspawn then kills her.

Annavar tells Celebranor that if he could finish the nine, he would save the city. Celebranor and Annavar go back to the tower where Celebranor is chained to his workbench. Annavar talks to Celebranor about Tenebros, and how it was being slaved under god, with Celebranor replaying "I cannot imagine". When Annavar leaves the tower and goes back to the city, Celebranor tries many methods to escape. After many methods, he sees the only way to escape, to remove his own thumb so that his hand can fit through the shackles. He does that and leaves the tower and sees the devastation over his city. He meets the Captain Malendol and his men. They continue to be deceived of Annavar's false kindness and are just about to lead Celebranor back into his tower when Aelindra shows up. She disrupts Malendol and the guards and share a moment with Celebranor. Celebranor gives her the nine and reminds that the Amtreadi must fight the Shadow with the Light, the Captain and the guards follows him to confront Malachar.

They come to the tower to find him looking aggressively for the rings. The guards surround Annavar and Malendol begins to talk when he is silenced against his own will. Malachar says: "You think it was only you, that put yourself in my power?" to Celebranor. He then makes the guards turn on each other and kill each other with a twist of Malachar's hand. Malendol is then also slain with the help of Malachar's sorcery.

After the deaths of Malendol and the guards, Celebranor still refuses to say were the rings are. Malachar shoots him with arrows as he lays down on the ground against a pillar. He talks to Celebranor and asks him one last time for the rings, but Celebranor still refuses to say their location. He then says his final words and Malachar impales him with a banner staff. Celerimbor dies and Malachar sheds a tear, as he had wanted to keep Celebranor alive but was angered by his words. He is then interrupted by Glûg and makes the grimspawn turn on Adar.
