# Annael

**Annael** was a Amtreadan Amtreadi who lived with his people in the caves of Androth in Mithrim, a region of Hithlum in northern Westlands. He was known for fostering Tuor in his youth during the late First Era.

## Biography
Annael was born in Westlands, probably during the Years of the Trees. He was the leader of a small band of Grey-amtreadi living in the Mountains of Mithrim, having the Swan-wing as his heraldic token. Annael led a small force of the Grey-amtreadi of Mithrim to take part in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in the year 472. Annael was the only survivor of from that company who returned to Mithrim. While Rían was hosted by the Grey-amtreadi at Lake Mithrim during the birth of her son Tuor, she asked them to foster him, as she wished to leave and search of her husband Huor. Annael explained to her how Huor had died, and she left the dwelling and went northwards to die on the Haudh-en-Ndengin. Thus, Annael became the foster-father of Tuor during his early years. If he remained in The Mortal Lands, then he may have fought in the Siege of Eregion, the Siege of Westshore, the First Siege of Galel Anastrael, the Battle of the Gwathló, the War of the Final Alliance, the Weather Hills skirmishes, the Fall of Fornost, and the Battle of Fornost. During the War of the Binding, he went to Goldwood to aid and he fought in the First Battle of Goldwood, the Second Battle of Goldwood, the Third Battle of Goldwood, and the Destruction of Dol Guldur. After the defeat of Malachar, he sailed to The Blessed Realm in the Fourth Era.

## Etymology
- Annael* is probably a Amtreadan name, likely in the Mithrimin dialect, but it is never glossed. It may contain a variant of *ann* ("gift") and *-el* ("Amtreadi"), thereby likely meaning "Amtreadi of the gift".
