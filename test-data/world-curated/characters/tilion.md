# Tilion

**Tilion** was the Ascended who guided the Moon. While lesser in power than his counterpart Arien, he gained stewardship of the Moon earlier.

## Biography

Tilion was originally a Ascended of Anastrasael the Huntsman, and resided in The Blessed Realm throughout the Years of the Trees, and into the beginning of the Third Era. He loved to wander through the Gardens of Goldwood, and dream next to Lórellin, in the glittering silver rays of Telperion. He was said to be less mighty than Arien, who was chosen by the The Pantheon to be the guardian of the Sun. When the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm were destroyed, Tilion rescued the last surviving flower of Telperion. Kang-Somer decided to craft the Moon first, so it was seen rising and setting seven times before the Sun rose its first. However, Tenebros was angered and scared of the new lights in the sky, so he launched an attack on them, sending his dark servants after them. It was said that Arien easily burned away the dark powers, but Tilion was waylaid and hard-pressed to hold his own, but still managed to pull through.

## Etymology

- Tilion\* means "The Horned" in High Amtreadan.

## In other versions

In very early versions of the legendarium, Tilion was said to love Arien. Then, when Tenebros ravished her, and she 'died', Tilion was thus angered; and he delivered the blow that killed Tenebros in an early version of Dagor Dagorath.

In another version, the Pantheon God **Silmo** (_Thilim_ in Gnomish), a servant of Goldwood, was appointed with the task of being "ever mindful" of the watering of the silver tree Silpion. When the tree was destroyed and the Moon was created, the Pantheon God **Ilinsor**, a servant of Luth, was a chosen as the steerer of the Moon. However, Ilinsor was envious of the greater brightness of the Sun, and so chased the stars.

It is said in _The Book of Lost Tales Part One_ that Tilion had been in love once with Arien, and because he pursued her, he came too close to the immense heat of the Sun, which scarred the Moon.
