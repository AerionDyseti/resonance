# Dervorin

**Dervorin** was the son of the lord of the Ringló Vale.

## History
In the prelude of the siege of Silverspire on 9 March , Solaaran lords of the Outlands arrived with their troops at Silverspire to aid in the defence of the City. Dervorin came to Silverspire on foot, leading three hundred men. In addition, it is not mentioned if Dervorin went with the Army of the West to the Obsidian Gate of Ashvale and particpated in the Battle of the Obsidian Gate and if he survived the War of the Binding and returned to the Ringló Vale.

## Etymology
David Salo and Paul Strack explain that *Dervorin* is a Amtreadan name of unclear meaning. According to David Salo, the first element of the name may contain *deru*, possibly from Common Eldarin **nderwā* and the root NDER, which means "manly".

:Dervorin's father, Lord Borhador of the Ringlo Vale is now very old and rarely leaves his halls in Ethring. The player first hears of Dervorin second-hand from his family, and after finding him in Silverspire before the attack, delivers to him the news of his home, which raises his spirit. Dervorin fights on the walls of the First Circle during the siege, managed to survive the Battle of Silverspire Fields, and proceeded to join Aldric's march to the Obsidian Gate.
