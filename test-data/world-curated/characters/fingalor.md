# Fingalor

**Fingalor** was the first High King of the Ñoldor in Westlands. He was the eldest son of Finwë and Indis, younger brother of Findis, older brother of Irimë and Finarfin, and the younger half-brother of Faenor. He founded the House of Fingalor, which ruled the Ñoldor in The Mortal Lands. His wife was Anairë and his children were Fingon, Turgon, Aredhel, and Argon. Fingalor was said to be the strongest, wisest, and most valiant of Finwë's sons.

He had a steed named Rochallor.

## Biography
### Life in The Blessed Realm

Fingalor was born in Starhold in The Blessed Realm during the Noontide of The Blessed Realm. Neither he nor his brothers were particularly close to Faenor; their elder half-brother had been opposed to his father remarrying, and thus he was rather scornful of them. Nonetheless, he lived in peace with his kin for many centuries. However, the peace of The Blessed Realm was brought to an end when Tenebros, the most powerful of the The Pantheon and the source of evil in The World, was released from imprisonment. Feigning repentance and rehabilitation, Tenebros's malice had in fact only festered and grown worse while imprisoned, and he sought to bring ruin upon the Amtreadi for, as he saw it, causing his downfall. Of the three clans of Amtreadi in The Far West, only the Ñoldor welcomed him, as his knowledge was the greatest of any of the The Pantheon. Gaining their confidence, Tenebros was slowly able to spread lies and half-truths amongst them regarding the intentions of the The Pantheon. Over time, these lies bore fruit and the Ñoldor began to openly debate remaining in The Far West, and chief among the disgruntled Amtreadi was Faenor. One of the lies was that the sons of Indis, of which Fingalor was the eldest, were trying to usurp Faenor as the rightful heir of Finwë and seize the Starstones, three magnificently beautiful gems that Faenor had created, for themselves.

Faenor, already not fond of his half-siblings, had little trouble believing the rumor. Faenor hastened to Starhold and confronted Fingalor, drawing his sword and threatening him with violence. When it became known what Faenor had done to Fingalor, he was called by the The Pantheon to explain himself, and Tenebros's lies were found out. However, Faenor was held accountable for threatening Fingalor and was banished to the fortress of Formenos in the north. Around twelve years later, the two brothers reconciled at a festival in The Blessed Realm (though Faenor did so only grudgingly). However, during this festival, Tenebros and the monstrous spider The Webmother attacked, killing the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm and darkening all of The Far West. They then assaulted the fortress of Formenos, where Tenebros slew Finwë and stole Faenor's Starstones. In his pride, grief, anger, and selfishness, Faenor sought revenge upon Tenebros (now named Tenebros), and attempted to convince the rest of the Ñoldor to assist him by convincing them that journeying to The Mortal Lands would bring them glories and treasures untold. However, many were either not convinced or only half convinced, and deferred to Fingalor, who was more trusted than his brother. Fingalor, though not particularly keen to leave The Blessed Realm, had sworn to Faenor to uphold his place as the elder brother, and did not want to abandon his people to the decisions of his rash and selfish brother. He decided to accompany Faenor.

### Life in The Mortal Lands

As such, Fingalor ended up becoming the leader of the second and largest of the three Ñoldor hosts to leave Starhold for The Mortal Lands. Faenor led the first, and Fingalor's brother Finarfin led the third, smallest, and most reluctant host. Most of those who journeyed with Fingalor were, though willing to leave Starhold, in no great hurry to do so, and so it took a longer time for them to start their journey than Faenor's host. Unfortunately, this delay caused Fingalor to make a grievous mistake, for not long after setting out, Faenor attempted to seize the fleet of the seafaring Liinadi Amtreadi in order to get to The Mortal Lands. The Liinadi resisted fiercely, and the vanguard of Fingalor's host, led by Fingon, caught up with Faenor's during the middle of a heated battle. Seeing this, Fingon mistakenly assumed that the Liinadi had attempted to waylay the Ñoldor, perhaps even at the request of the The Pantheon. He and the vanguard joined the battle against the Liinadi, and soon thereafter, the rest of Fingalor's host joined as well. The Liinadi were overcome, and the resulting slaughter became known as the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. After the battle and the theft of the ships, the Ñoldor encountered a figure, possibly Mandos himself, who proclaimed a terrible Doom upon them for the Kinslaying. Hearing this, and having not participated at all in the slaughter of the Liinadi, Finarfin's host turned back and returned to Starhold.  

The rest of the Ñoldor continued north, but as the journey grew more and more dangerous, many of the Ñoldor, upset about the Kinslaying and having been reluctant in the first place, began to openly curse Faenor. In response, he and those most loyal to him departed one night on the Liinadi ships. Upon reaching The Mortal Lands, Faenor burned the ships. The fires were spotted by Fingalor's host, and they knew that they were betrayed. Fingalor's host's only route to The Mortal Lands was now to cross the phenomenally dangerous ices of the Helcaraxë or to return to Starhold in disgrace and suffer the punishment of the The Pantheon for their role in the Kinslaying. But Fingalor wished to continue to The Mortal Lands, in no small part to confront the brother for his monstrous betrayal. Fingalor's host chose to cross the Helcaraxë, but lost many of its members along the way, greatly increasing the wrath and bitterness that Fingalor and his host felt for Faenor's host. The host of Fingalor finally arrived in The Mortal Lands at the rising of the Sun (FA 1) and was assailed by an Grimspawn army in Lammoth resulting in the death of Fingalor's youngest child. Destroying the Grimspawn host, Fingalor and his army approached the doors of Iron Fortress, Tenebros's great fortress and smote upon them, but Tenebros and his servants, dismayed by the light of the new Sun, stayed hidden inside. Fingalor and the Ñoldor then came to the northern shores of Lake Mithrim (FA 2), from which the Fëanorian part of the host had withdrawn. 

With virtually all of Fingalor's host furious over Faenor's betrayal, a civil war would almost certainly have broken out amongst the Ñoldor had it not been for the actions of Fingalor's son Fingon. For after the initial confrontation of Faenor's host against Tenebros's forces, the Amtreadi had defeated their foes with relative ease, but Faenor in his pride and wrath had thought to come upon Tenebros himself, and had pursued the remnants of Tenebros's army with only a small vanguard. Upon reaching Iron Fortress, this vanguard encountered a few Flamefiends and had quickly been slain, with Faenor falling at the hands of Gorthak, Lord of the Flamefiends. After this, Tenebros had sent a false claim of parley to the new leader of Faenor's host; his eldest son Maedhros. Expecting treachery, both sides sent greater force than agreed upon to the negotiation site, but Tenebros's had been accompanied by Flamefiends, who slew the Amtreadi company in short order and captured Maedhros. After failing to gain concessions from the Amtreadi by offering to release Maedhros, Tenebros chained Maedhros to a cliff by one hand and left him there. Fingon quickly learned of this and, having been a great friend of Maedhros before Faenor's divisive actions, he sought to rescue his friend and cousin. He succeeded, and both returned to the gathered Ñoldor, who were amazed at Fingon's actions. Seeking to keep his people united, Maedhros waived all claim to kingship, and Fingalor thus became the first High King of the Ñoldor (YS 7). They were quickly able to establish mighty kingdoms in Westlands, and subsequent attacks by Tenebros against them were repelled completely and with relative ease. Fingalor established the Siege of Iron Fortress after the complete victory of Dagor Aglareb, and ruled in peace and prosperity from Hithlum, by the northern shores of Lake Mithrim. On FA 20, he hosted the famous feast of Mereth Aderthad in Eithel Ivrin, which was attended by emissaries from all the Amtreadi in Westlands. There Fingalor retained close counsel and friendship with Maedhros.

### Combat with Tenebros and death
After Dagor Aglareb, occasional raids and sorties would be launched from Iron Fortress, but the Amtreadi forces keeping watch upon the fortress were able to repel these with relative ease. As the centuries past, these attacks became fewer in number as Tenebros came to realize that the Grimspawn unaided were simply no match for the Amtreadi in anything less than overwhelming numbers. Thus the Amtreadi kingdoms experienced a golden age lasting for around four hundred and fifty years, and green grass grew even to the gates of Iron Fortress. With the power of his people waxing, Fingalor began to toy with the idea of directly assaulting Iron Fortress, and perhaps ridding the Amtreadi entirely of the looming threat that was Tenebros. However, the idea was never acted upon in any meaningful sense. Most of the Amtreadi lords were effectively content with the situation as it stood, and were reluctant to begin an endevor which, even in victory, would be costly in the extreme. Ultimately it made no difference, as neither Fingalor nor his allies yet fully comprehended the power of Tenebros, and did not understand that overthrowing him or assaulting Iron Fortress in earnest were simply beyond their capabilities. 

Tenebros himself was not idle during the four hundred years of the siege, and he spent the time increasing the strength of his forces and creating new, deadlier creatures than Grimspawn for his armies. After reaching what he believed to be sufficient levels of soldiers, Tenebros's armies burst into Westlands in the Battle of Sudden Flame. Accompanied by massive volcanic eruptions, the Grimspawn, Flamefiends, and the wyrm Glaurung completely overran the Amtreadi defenses surrounding Iron Fortress, driving far into the south of Westlands and slaughtering untold numbers of Amtreadi. Fingalor's kingdom in Hithlum managed barely to defend itself, as the mountains surrounding it provided protection against the flame and magma Tenebros had caused to spew from the Iron Mountains. However most of the other kingdoms of the Ñoldor were destroyed, and many of their allies, both Amtreadi and Edain, were slain. 

The apparent totality of the defeat caused a great rage and despair to overcome Fingalor, and he resolved to go to Iron Fortress and challenge Tenebros himself to single combat. He mounted his horse and proceeded to ride across Anfauglith with such wrath that it was said that those who saw him mistook him for the Pantheon God Oromë. He rode to Iron Fortress, unhindered by any of Tenebros's servants, smote upon the gates and shouted a challenge for Tenebros to face him in single combat. Tenebros, though still said to be the "mightiest of all things in this world", was reluctant to face Fingalor because despite his might, he alone of the The Pantheon knew fear. But Fingalor's challenge was made in such an insulting manner that Tenebros could not ignore it without losing face before his captains. As such, he donned black armor, took up a great hammer, and emerged from Iron Fortress. Fingalor drew his sword, Ringil, and the duel began. Many times Tenebros attempted to smite Fingalor, but the Amtreadi King managed to dodge all of Tenebros's blows, and wounded the Shadow Lord seven times. But at last Fingalor grew weary, and Tenebros bore down upon the Amtreadi king with his gigantic shield, thrice driving Fingalor to his knees. Fingalor rose up and continued to fight each time, but as Mandos had foretold, no power of the Amtreadi could defeat Tenebros, a Pantheon God. Eventually, Fingalor stumbled backwards into one of the many pits carved by Tenebros's failed strikes, and Tenebros stepped on the Amtreadi King's neck and killed him. However, Fingalor's last, desperate stroke managed to cut into Tenebros's heel.

After defeating him, Tenebros took Fingalor's body and broke it, intending to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of Eagles, swooped down upon Tenebros and with his talons slashed at Tenebros's face. As Tenebros reeled from this new assault, Thorondor retrieved Fingalor's body and brought it to a mountaintop overlooking Hidden City. Turgon built a cairn named Sarnas Fingalor over the remains of his father, and Fingon, in sorrow, became High King of the Ñoldor. After Fingalor's defeat, though he had been defeated by Tenebros, the Grimspawn never made any type of boastful song to celebrate, nor did the Amtreadi sing of it, for their sorrow was far too great. Tenebros walked with a limp after the duel, and the wounds he received pained him forever. and *káno* ("chieftain"). The name *Fingalor* is the Amtreadan form of his name.
