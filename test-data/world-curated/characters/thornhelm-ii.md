# Thornhelm II

**Thornhelm II** was the twenty-sixth and last Lord Steward of Argenthal, and father of War of the Binding heroes Valdric and Aldwin.

## Biography

Thornhelm was the third child and only son of Ecthelion II. Together, the couple had two sons, Valdric and Aldwin. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died young, leaving Thornhelm embittered.

He succeeded his father Ecthelion II as twenty-sixth Lord Steward in TA 2984. During his stewardship, Valdris was less welcome in Galim Vir, and his counsels went unheeded.

### War of the Binding

In later life, Thornhelm secretly used a seeing-stone to probe Malachar's strength, using it at the top of the White Tower in a secret chamber above the throne room. The effort aged him prematurely, and although Malachar was not able to bend him to his will as he had Morvain, knowledge of the Shadow Lord's overwhelming forces exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife.

Thornhelm was well aware that Malachar's assault on Argenthal would come during his lifetime and prepared accordingly, even though he increasingly came to believe that the struggle would be hopeless. In TA 3018 when Malachar attacked Starbridge, he found the strength and preparedness of Thornhelm greater than he had expected or feared. Galim Vir was fully provisioned for a siege and as war loomed Thornhelm sent away from the city the old, the women and children and had the beacons of Argenthal lit, dispatching errand-riders with the Red Arrow to Theron of Aranada to summon aid.

The death of Valdric, his eldest and favorite son, and the siege and apparent doom of Argenthal drove Thornhelm further along the path of despair. Following this news and the passage of Tomlen Burrows through Moonvale he became estranged from Aldwin, though Aldwin still upheld his father's wishes. After his death the Anor-stone would only show Thornhelm's hands slowly withering in flame, unless the viewer had great strength of will to turn it to other visions.

## Etymology

- Thornhelm\* had been the name of the tenth Lord Steward of Argenthal, who, in turn, was named after a king of the Nandorin Amtreadi.

The name comes from the Nandorin words _dene_ ("strong, lithe") and _thara_ ("tall, slender"), and gives the name a meaning of "Lithe and lank".
