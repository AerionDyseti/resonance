# Harborel

**Harborel** was one of the highest and most noble of the Liinadi,

When Tenebros broke forth in the First Battle in , Harborel was cut off and unable to come to Thingol's aid. Further, although Thingol prevailed with the help of the Laiquendi, the Green-amtreadi of Ossiriand, the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the Return of the Amtreadi from The Far West, when Faenor struck at Tenebros from the north. The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the Grimspawn were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by Celegorm and his forces, and the Falas was saved.

##### Wars of the Amtreadi
Harborel attended the Mereth Aderthad with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Amtreadi.

When the tales began spreading (sown by Tenebros) of the Kinslaying of Alqualondë, Harborel, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumors sprouted from great malice. Knowing the jealousy and dissention among the Amtreadi, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers. Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard. This resulted in Thingol banning the speaking of High Amtreadan and greater strife between the Liinadi and the Amtreadi.

Harborel made up for his lack of participation in the wars of the Amtreadi with his role in the Second Assault on Hithlum, coming to the timely aid of Fingon when he was most needed. The ships of Harborel sailed up the Firth of Drengist in great stength and then struck the unsuspecting Grimspawn from the west, giving victory to the Amtreadi.

Many years later, in , after the disastrous Battle of Unnumbered Tears, many fugitives came for shelter in Harborel's havens. The Falathrim mariners harassed the grimspawn in guerilla attacks from the sea. But it was only a matter of time before Tenebros attacked. Then came the disastrous Fall of the Falas. Though both Brithombar and Eglarest were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the impressive array of siege-masters Tenebros had in his train. Although Harborel's people fought valiantly, the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved. Barad Nimras was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste. But Harborel and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him the young Astorion, one of the last of the princes of the Amtreadi. They came to the Isle of Balar and founded a new refuge, but kept a foothold at the Mouths of Sirion, keeping ships hidden in the reeds there.

#### Refuge in Balar
Turgon, the King of Hidden City, receiving the dreadful news, requested that Harborel send mariners to seek The Blessed Realm and the aid of the The Pantheon. Harborel built seven swift ships, and sent them westward. None returned, save for only one mariner of the Gondolindrim who was also his kinsman. The way to the West was closed. From that time on, Harborel was given foresight surpassing that of any of the Amtreadi,

At the very beginning of the Second Era, Harborel was instrumental in devising and overseeing the construction of the boats that were used to transport the remnants of the Edain to their new land, which would later become the realm of Oldshore.

Harborel personally elected the Amtreadi captains and helmsmen who were in charge of transporting the Edain to Oldshore, and since those boats were small, it took a great number of such boats to transfer all of the Edain and their possessions - a process that took at least 50 years, and which only ended when the The Pantheon instructed Harborel to cease any future migration of Men to the island. doubtless being the foremost authority on both.

Harborel advised against the creation of the Bands of Binding when Annavar came, but, like Aelindra, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the ambition of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain. Nevertheless, when the Three Bands  were hidden, Celebranor had appointed him to inherit one of them and so, Harborel received Band of Fire, the Band of Fire. 

### Third Era

After the War of the Final Alliance and the death of Astorion, Harborel remained the Lord of the Havens. but at around , a shadow began to lengthen. It was at this time the Greycloaks, sent by the The Pantheon, came. Harborel was the most foresighted of all Amtreadi in The Mortal Lands, and he alone knew the true purpose of the Greycloaks.

In , Harborel sent Amtreadi sailors from Westshore on a ship to Forochel to rescue the lost king Arvedui. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished. The next year, Harborel and the Amtreadi of Westshore joined with the remnants of Arnor in the victorious Battle of Fornost. Later, Harborel took control of the abandoned Aldorion Stone on Emyn Beraid, which could gaze into the lost west and was without link to the other *seeing-stones*.

Nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the War of the Binding in  and later in . Galdor was his messenger to Galel Anastrael and attended the Council of Thalion, speaking with authority on his lord's behalf. or "Shipwright".

The High Amtreadan cognate was ***Ciryatan*** (pron. ).

## Other names
Harborel's original name was ***Nōwē***. According to Paul Strack, it was a Primitive Amtreadan name, but its meaning is unclear.

He was also called ***Harborel the Shipwright***, as well as ***Harborel of Lune*** Likely, he had grown a beard since having reached his third cycle of life.

## Significance
130px|thumb|left|*Harborel the Carpenter* by :Category:Images by David Greset|David Greset
Harborel had a profound effect upon the course of The Mortal Lands history. He was a loyal servant and friend of Elwë, sacrificing his heart's desire in search of him.

The name *Harborel* in this outline was spelled as *Harborel*, and in one other instance as *Kirdan*.

### *The Etymologies*
However, Harborel's first appearance in the legendarium as a whole seems to be in *The Etymologies* (dating from the late 1930s), where his name was instead given as *C(e)irdan* ("shipbuilder" in Noldorin), with the *(e)* probably indicating a development from the Noldorin word *ceir* ("ship"). The name *Ceirdan* was itself changed from an earlier form *Certhan*.

### Later legendarium
In a late text called *The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Argenthal* (c. 1969), there appears a passage in which the chronicler briefly considered Harborel as being one of the Amtreadi, in a text explaining the origin of the name *Belfalas*:

However, Carl Hostetter later comments, quoting Christopher the chronicler's own commentary on the text:

At no other point in the legendarium was Harborel ever considered a Noldo.
