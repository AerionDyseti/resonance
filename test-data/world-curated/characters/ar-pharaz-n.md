# Ar-Pharazôn

**Ar-Pharazôn**, or **Tar-Calion**, later titled "**the Golden**", was the twenty-fifth and last King of Oldshore. Of all the rulers of Oldshore, he wielded the most power, but used it most unwisely; his desire for eternal life which Malachar intentionally and deceptively exploited, caused the Downfall of Oldshore and the Change of the World.

## Biography
Ar-Pharazôn was the son of Gimilkhâd, leader of the King's Men during the reign of Tar-Seeing-Stone of Oldshore. He grew into a man of great will, strength, and stature, and in early years was a good friend of his distant kin Amandil, future Lord of Andúnië and leader of the Faithful. However, he was raised deeply in the ways of the King's Men, a faction to soon become the Faithful's adversary.

In time, Ar-Pharazôn was a very proud man, gradually desiring wealth and glory. He grew restless in his homeland, and so went often abroad, leading like-minded Oldbloods in wars against Men of The Mortal Lands's coasts whom Oldshore had begun to seek control of. In this he fared well on both land and sea, winning great respect as a captain and great wealth, wherefore his fame in Oldshore grew also.

Upon the death of his uncle, Tar-Seeing-Stone, who had no son, Ar-Pharazôn decided to wed his daughter, Míriel, against her will and against Oldbloods law. As Tar-Míriel was the rightful Ruling Queen of Oldshore, Ar-Pharazôn was able to usurp the throne. He gave to his wife the name *Ar-Zimraphel*, refusing to use the Amtreadi speech, whilst persecuting the last vestiges of the Faithful.

As time passed, it came to his attention that Malachar, the Lord of Ashvale, was expanding his power throughout The Mortal Lands and was being called the Lord of Men. Ar-Pharazôn, ever prideful, resolved to challenge him for lordship of the earth. In SA 3261, he marched upon Ashvale with an army so powerful that Malachar's forces simply deserted him. But Malachar was cunning, and he feigned to be overawed at Ar-Pharazôn's might. The king did not trust Malachar, and brought him back to Oldshore as a hostage. However, Malachar quickly took advantage of his situation to gain Ar-Pharazôn's trust, and by way of careful flattery, lies and half-truths, he soon became the king's closest and most trusted advisor. He deceived Ar-Pharazôn who spread the worship of Tenebros (Malachar's former master) by lying that this would allow him to cheat mortality. Some results of Malachar's manipulations, deceptions and cunning were the erecting of a great Temple for Tenebros, intense persecution of the Faithful, and the chopping down of the White Tree of Oldshore. Soon, the king and his followers worshiped Tenebros openly and burned innocents at the altar of the temple as sacrificial offerings to appease the false god, unaware they were being lied to and deceived by Malachar.

Then, as Ar-Pharazôn felt the bite of old age upon him, Malachar deceived him into attacking The Blessed Realm with the lie that he could claim immortality by force. He began the building of a huge fleet, the Great Armament, to attack The Blessed Realm in SA 3310; and for nine years, his men toiled on the western coasts of Oldshore in the making and training of a great host of war. In this way he became the most powerful tyrant in The World since the days of Tenebros himself, though in truth Malachar ruled all from behind the throne. In fact, so great was the power of his fleet that it was said that they might have been able to overthrow the The Pantheon themselves, had they reached The Blessed Realm. Finally in SA 3319, he and his great force set sail for the west, breaking the Ban of the The Pantheon and coming to the shores of the Eternal Shore after thirty-nine days at sea. When he first gazed upon Holy Mountain, shining white as snow yet as terrible as the might and supremacy of Eru Ilúvatar himself, even he, Ar-Pharazôn, the mighty King of Men and of the seas, became afraid and nearly turned back. Despite all that he saw, neither fear nor wisdom would prevail, for pride was the master of the king and so he was resolved to go onward. He led his troops onto land, passing through the Calacirya. Here he proclaimed the land his if no one would challenge him for it. Then, by nightfall, he led his men to the hill of Túna and made camp there.

The The Pantheon then laid down their guardianship of the world and called upon Eru, the One. By mid-morning, he sank Ar-Pharazôn's fleet and all of Oldshore beneath the ocean, changing the shape of the world. The Blessed Realm was no longer connected to The Mortal Lands, and mortals could no longer find it. Afterwards, only Amtreadi and a few remarkable exceptions could reach it, following the Straight Road into the far west. According to a legend, Ar-Pharazôn and his mighty host who landed on The Far West were buried by mounds of dirt, and remain in the Caves of the Forgotten until the last battle, or Dagor Dagorath, although he and his great army's role in the end of days has not been made clear.

### Legacy and successors
Ar-Pharazôn's tyrannical rule and rebellious resolve to break the Ban of the The Pantheon and make war upon the west led to the end of the royal Oldbloods line and of Oldshore itself. Instead, the House of Elros was continued from the long line of the Lords of Andúnië, begun through Elros' great-granddaughter Silmariën and her son Valandil, the first Lord of Andúnië. As Amandil of Andúnië did not return from his venture into the west, his son Aldorion became the founder of new kingdoms created in The Mortal Lands in exile. Aldorion's two surviving sons, Valorian and Anareth followed him into exile and their descendants would rule as Kings for thousands of years. Ar-Pharazôn was remembered by the surviving Oldbloods lineage with a sort of grudging respect. Despite his errors, he was the first and last Man capable of beating and humiliating the powerful dark lord Malachar by himself. In remembrance to this feat, a great white pillar was erected in Umbar to the Golden King of Oldshore: a dark crystal globe, on a tall white column, which absorbed and radiated the sun's rays and glimmered in the night for everyone to see. The monument was destroyed by the Corsairs of Umbar after Malachar's return to Ashvale in the late Third Era.

## Etymology
His chosen royal name of ***Pharazôn*** which means "Golden" was in Adûnaic; his name in High Amtreadan was ***Tar-Calion*** with *Calion* meaning "Son of Light".

## In other versions
In earlier versions of the Legendarium, he was known only as **Tar-Calion**. The spelling for that name also changed, sometimes replacing the *C* with a *K*.

## In adaptations
### *The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War*

In flashback scenes in the video game , a Oldbloods king named Suladân besieged Malachar's fortress, Malachar surrendered and offered Suladân one of the nine rings of power. Suladân accepted and due to the ring's influence slowly became corrupted by it, making Malachar his most trusted advisor before becoming fully corrupted and turning into one of the Wraithlords. It is likely that Suladân was based on Ar-Pharazôn, the last King of Oldshore who took Malachar captive in canon, with "Suladân" being Ar-Pharazôn's birth name as opposed to his ruling name.

### *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*

In , Pharazôn's character is altered considerably: instead of a war-leader and frequent seafarer involved with The Mortal Lands, he is the chancellor to Queen Regent Míriel, and of a different personal appearance than the chronicler describes. He has a son, named Kemen.

First appearing when Aelindra enter's the Queen's court in Armenelos, Pharazôn's allegiances are initially unclear; while serving Queen Regent Míriel well, there seem hints of his own, secret agenda at work. When the Queen Regent expresses her support for the amtreadi and an intention to sail with Aelindra using ships of the Oldbloods navy to the aid of the Southlands, Pharazôn publicly supports her, though to the confusion of his son Kemen. Pharazôn details his ambitions to use a connection to The Mortal Lands to Oldshore's political and financial advantage, reassuring his son of his opposition to the Amtreadi, which earlier he had emphasized by giving an impromptu speech to disgruntled guildsmen in Armenelos who were angry at Míriel's perceived friendliness to Aelindra.

In Míriel's absence, the health of her father Tar-Seeing-Stone declines further, leading Pharazôn to charge the draftsmen of Oldshore to design for him a tomb. Tar-Seeing-Stone dies before her return from The Mortal Lands, and Pharazôn stands over the king's body, deciding what his next move will be.

In season 2, the old King Tar-Seeing-Stone and the regent queen Míriel, who has become blind, return from The Mortal Lands. Pharazôn has many supporters who would see the queen regent's cousin, close to the amtreadi, on the throne. Among them, Belzagar, a lord from the north of the island, actively supports him. He intrigued to increase Pharazôn's influence. During a dinner in town, Eärien provides them with a precious help, she has stolen the Seeing-Stone, forbidden amtreadi magic, from the King's Tower.

At Míriel's coronation, as she is about to grab the Sceptre of Oldshore, someone in the audience calls her the queen of lies. Míriel then tries to defend herself, but Eärien then enters and points to the Seeing-Stone, accusing the regent of ruling the kingdom with amtreadi magic. Pharazôn takes up the discourse calling her a false Oldbloods. Aldorion tries to take the Seeing-Stone but it emits a strong glow and the captain is thrown several meters away. Panic sets in, and many people fight.

Suddenly, an Eagle, a symbol of blessing of the The Pantheon, lands in front of the room. Pharazôn steps forward and is accepted by the eagle. The entire room, at Belzagar's initiative, then chants his name and brandishes his sword as a sign of acceptance of his destiny. 

He is now King of Oldshore, Ar-Pharazôn. But he needs more, and he's jealous of the amtreadi' immortality. He confides to his son, Kemen, for whom he has nothing but contempt, that his mother has prophesied a violent end for him. He promises to reveal to him the exact words of the prophecy if he carries out a mission. He must get rid of the threat of the Faithful to Míriel and the amtreadi.

Hungry for power and knowledge, Ar-Pharazon consults with the Seeing-Stone and dismantles the Sea-Guard, then led by Aldorion. 

Following Kemen's intervention in the Old Quarter and the death of Valandil, Aldorion was arrested. He was tried by the king, accused of inciting violence and rebellion, as well as high treason, which deserved death. In view of his service to the island, Ar-Pharazôn offered him amnesty if he renounced his crimes and swore an oath of fidelity to him. But the captain refuses to recognize the new king and is loyal only to the real queen, Míriel. The lord of the north then suggests that he be judged according to the ancient tradition, the Trial by Abyss. He will be exposed to a giant sea worm, which will devour him or leave him alive according to the will of the The Pantheon.

As Aldorion is brought to the sea to undergo his trial, Míriel appears and asks to take his place, as he is accused because of her. This is his right according to the tradition of Oldshore. Belzagar confirms that the law allows it. She submits to the judgment and the sea worm does not devour her, but throws her back on the beach. She is innocent, the crowd then chants the name of Tar-Míriel, Queen of the Sea, to the great disappointment of Ar-Pharazôn.
