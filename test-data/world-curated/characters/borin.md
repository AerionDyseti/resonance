# Borin

**Borin** was a Forgekin leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen Forgekin who accompanied Durgan II Ironbark on the quest to regain the Ironpeak.

A Forgekin Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Durgan's closest friends and advisers. Borin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Grundin.

He later went to re-establish the Forgekin presence in Shadowdeep, but within five years it was overcome once more by Grimspawn, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

## Biography
### Early life
Borin was likely born in the Ironpeak before the coming of the wyrm Scorath. He had a younger brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Scorath attacked the Ironpeak. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA 2841, he accompanied Thragol II, the father of Durgan, when he attempted to go back to the Ironpeak himself. Thragol was captured and lost.

### Quest of Ironpeak
Borin was part of the company assembled by Durgan Ironbark in TA 2941 that journeyed to the Ironpeak with Jasper Burrows and Valdris to defeat Scorath, and to retake the kingdom of Ironpeak. He was the second Forgekin to arrive at Jasper's home, where, like his brother Dwalin, he played a viol as big as himself. Following the meeting's conclusion and the company's initial departure to the Green Griffin Inn, Borin spotted Jasper hurrying to reach them before they set out.

Borin, along with his companions, underwent the journey through the Trollshaws and Lone-lands to Galel Anastrael, including the encounter with the stonelurks Tom, Bert, and William. With Valdris's help, the Forgekin escaped, and subsequently Borin was posted as a lookout when Jasper returned, having been separated from the company during their flight. Due to Jasper's usage of the Binding Band, which he had discovered in the Grimspawn tunnels, the Shirefolk crept by Borin unnoticed, puzzling the Forgekin a great deal. Soon afterwards, the company was beset by Shadowwolves, which forced them to climb a number of pine trees until their rescue by the Skywardens.

The Eagles took them to their eyrie, and then to the Carrock, from whence the company traveled to Bjorn's hall. Despite having been warned to the contrary, the Forgekin eventually left the path after running low on supplies, and were soon waylaid by great spiders, which intended to eat them. Jasper used the Band to escape notice, and returned to free them. Borin afterwards led the company in escaping from and fighting off the spiders, though the Forgekin were captured by Wood-amtreadi, and taken to the hall of the Amtreadi King, Thornael. It was here that Borin spoke for his companions, arguing for their release. Thornael refused, and imprisoned the Forgekin, until Jasper again rescued the company.

The Forgekin came to Lake-town, and then to the Ironpeak. After opening the Side-door to the mountain, Borin was the only member of the company willing to go with Jasper some way inside. The shirefolk, after unintentionally disturbing the wyrm Scorath, returned to the Forgekin, but Scorath left his lair and attempted to kill the Forgekin before turning to Lake-town, with the intent to destroy it. The dragon was there slain by Braden, and the Forgekin took possession of the mountain. Durgan and Borin, not long after, came upon the raven Roäc, who brought word of the wyrm's demise.

Borin fought in and survived the subsequent Battle of Five Armies, which was fought against Grimspawn led by Bolgrak, after tensions with the Lake-men and Wood-amtreadi had run high, due to a disagreement about the division of Scorath's treasure. He took up residence at the Ironpeak afterwards with the surviving members of the company.

### Visiting Jasper
Seven years after the Quest for Ironpeak, Borin accompanied Valdris to visit Jasper in the Shirelands in TA 2949, since the two had become good friends during their travels. He and Valdris gave Jasper the news of current happenings in The Mortal Lands.

Sometime afterward in the coming years before his expedition in TA 2989, Borin would visit Jasper at least one more time. During this visit to the Shirelands, Borin met Jasper's newly adopted heir of Burrow's End, Tomlen, and the young Shirefolk would come to learn of some of Borin and his Uncle's travels to the lonely mountain.

### Expedition into Shadowdeep

In TA 2989, Though his king did not give his consent, Borin and company went anyway. Among his numbers were fellow members of Durgan's company Óin and Ori. While in Shadowdeep, he discovered Grundin's Axe and a Truesilver helm (possibly the crown of Grundin l) and claimed them as his own. After the discovery of these items Borin, being a descendant of the line of Grundin, claimed rulership over the Forgekin realm, taking the title Lord of Shadowdeep (his colony being too small to be counted as a kingdom). Ultimately, the search for the ring, which conferred great wealth and a curse of greed on its owner, was in vain, as it had been taken from Thragol II by Malachar.

### Death
After ruling as Shadowdeep's Lord for about five years, Borin was slain by Grimspawn on November 10 TA 2994, Ironically, he died in the same place and the same way as his father had been slain 195 years before in TA 2799.

### Legacy

Some twenty-five years later in TA 3019, the Company of the Band passed through Shadowdeep and discovered Borin's tomb, and the truth of what happened to his expedition, which had not previously been known, in the Book of Mazarbul. The knowledge of this brought much grief to Borin's cousin Thorngar, who was a member of the fellowship.

## In adaptations

### *The Shirefolk* animated film
In the 1977 animated version of , he was voiced by Don Messick. He is one of the few Forgekin to have a major role in the film. 

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's , he was portrayed by Scottish actor Ken Stott. The studio released the following statement regarding Borin in the films:
- A descendant of nobility and a Forgekin Lord in his own right, Borin is one of the oldest members of The Company of Forgekin. Wise and gentle by nature, he has been forced to live a life fraught with war and the ongoing struggle for survival. Related to Durgan Ironbark, Borin is one of his closest, most trusted advisers – but deep in his heart, this wisest and most loyal of Forgekin harbors troubling doubts about the wisdom of the Quest for the Ironpeak.* 

In , Borin shows his wisdom when he tells Fíli and Kíli and Jasper about Durgan’s dislike for Grimspawn.

In , Borin persuades Braden the Archer to take them safely to Lake-town in return for a huge amount of money (double Braden's usual barge fare), an event that did not occur in the book.

In , Borin fights in and survives the battle, during which he helps to man a forgekin war chariot and transport Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to Ravenhill. He later personally bids Jasper farewell at his leaving.

Borin fights with a weapon with similarities to a sword and a mace, which Ken Stott, asked for himself. While in the book, Borin is about twenty years younger than Durgan, in Peter Jackson's three-part adaptation, Borin is ranked as the oldest member of the company.

### Video games

In , Young Borin makes a cameo appearance in a flashback sequence depicting the Battle of Azanulbizar. Older Borin makes another silent cameo during the Company's departure for the Quest of Ironpeak. In the present day, the fate of Borin's expedition in Shadowdeep is uncovered by the sons of Bifur and Bofur.

#### Personality
Borin is portrayed to be the wiser, more social and sceptical individual in Durgan and Company. He is kind, sly and brave, an excellent fighter. Durgan, at one point, notes Borin's skill as a fighter. He develops an essentially strong relationship with the other Forgekin he travels with and is willing to fight alongside them for any cause. He is sympathetic, sometimes cynical, towards Jasper Burrows, remarking that the latter wasn't fit for the job they had set out to do. He got on brilliantly with Durgan, and seemed to share something of a grandfatherly view of the latter.
