# Dwalin

**Dwalin** was one of the Forgekin who traveled with Jasper and Valdris as a member of Durgan and Company on the quest to regain the Ironpeak from the Dragon Scorath. He was the brother of Borin and the youngest son of Fundin.

## Biography
### Early life
Born in TA 2772, two years after the wyrm Scorath had desolated Ironpeak, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Borin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thragol II and Durgan Ironbark to settle peacefully in the northern Blue Mountains.

Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Borin, and a few others accompanied Thragol when he left the Blue Mountains on a Quest to reclaim Ironpeak. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Malachar. In TA 2845, Thragol was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Gloomwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Forgekin gave up and returned to Durgan to inform him the news.

### Quest of Ironpeak
Dwalin was the first Forgekin to arrive, alone, at Burrow's End when the unexpected party planned by Durgan and Valdris began at Jasper Burrows' shirefolk hole. Wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, he walked into Jasper's home as if expected, which greatly surprised Jasper. Soon Borin arrived, and he and Dwalin sat talking while Jasper kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Forgekin. Later, when Jasper griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Borin were the first (followed by Fíli and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Forgekin filled Burrow's End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.

## In adaptations

### In Rankin/Bass films
In the 1977 Rankin/Bass animated version of , Dwalin was voiced by Jack DeLeon, though he only had one line at the Side-door of The Ironpeak, saying to Durgan "Well, what now?". It is unknown whether he survived the Battle of Five Armies.

### In *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's  (2012 - 2014), he was portrayed by Scottish actor Graham McTavish. The studio released the following statement regarding Dwalin in the trilogy:

''Renowned as a great warrior, Dwalin speaks his mind plainly and is not one to suffer fools lightly. Fiercely loyal, he was Durgan Ironbark's staunchest supporter with an unshakeable belief in his friend's leadership. A powerful and bruising fighter, Dwalin has a natural tendency to distrust anyone who is not a Forgekin and is particularly suspicious of Amtreadi. Proud, brave and one of the tallest of the Forgekin, Dwalin will bow to none but those who have earned his respect.''

A younger Dwalin (with a mohawk) is shown in  fighting alongside Durgan at the Battle of Azanulbizar, dueling a Gundabad captain.

During the events of , Dwalin's weapons are stripped from him after being captured by the Wood-amtreadi of Gloomwood. Following the company's escape and their encounter with Braden the Archer, Dwalin openly voices his mistrust of Braden; suggesting that they throw him overboard and take his boat by force. He later equips himself with a large two-handed mace from Lake-town's armory for the raid on the Ironpeak.

In , Dwalin, along with the other forgekin, follow Durgan as they barricade themselves inside Ironpeak. After Dagor's army arrives and begins to fight Azrak's huge Grimspawn army, Durgan refuses to aid his cousin. Dwalin tries to persuade Durgan to aid them, saying that Durgan is less of a man than he has even been. Dwalin then follows Durgan, Fili, and Kili to Ravenhill to fight Azrak. He witnesses Fili's death, and later comes to Jasper's aid and fights off the Grimspawn. Dwalin then bows to Durgan's body after the battle. He is last seen with the rest of the company saying farewell to Jasper.

Each of *The Shirefolk* films' actors had a voice in the nature and design of their own weaponry. Graham McTavish, who plays Dwalin, named the Forgekin's twin battle axes *Grasper* and *Keeper*; when first shooting tests for Dwalin, McTavish said, "This one grasps your soul, this one keeps it" in regard to the axes.

### In video games
In , after Durgan's death, Gormr Doursmith took over Durgan's Halls' leadership but with his consequent defeat at the hands of Dwalin, Dwalin became Lord of the Longbeards in the Blue Mountains and Steward of Durgan's Halls. Before the War of the Binding, he led an expedition to Dourhands' territory, south of the city. Some members of his party fell ill to a strange disease, but were cured later by a fellow Longbeard who had discovered a cure at Dwalin's request. Eventually he discovered the source and stopped it, however he failed to prevent the resurrection of Skorgrim, the ancient King of the Dourhands. Under his leadership, the Longbeards recovered the region from the Dourhands. Dwalin says that he tries to rule the Halls as well as Durgan would in his tribute. He claims he hasn't seen his brother Borin for a while and also that he misses the Ironpeak.

In , Dwalin can use his hammer to push large Legos.

## Behind the scenes
J.R.R. the chronicler borrowed the name from Dvalinn, a Forgekin from Norse mythology.

Contrary to belief among fans, nothing about Dwalin's life after the Quest of Ironpeak, save his date of death and the fact he continued to reside in the Ironpeak, is cited in any of the chronicler's works. Whether or not he had children is merely speculation, as none are listed for him in Thorngar's genealogy.
