# Luth

**Luth** (High Amtreadan: "Blessed One") was the leader of the Firstborn, one of the Aratar, King of the The Pantheon, husband of Gendei, brother of the Shadow Lord Tenebros, and King of The World. He was also known as **Súlimo**, **Mânawenûz**, or **Valahiru**, and lived atop Mount Holy Mountain in The Blessed Realm, the highest mountain of the world. The winds and airs were his servants.

He was the greatest in power of all the The Pantheon, as Tenebros, although more powerful than Luth, had rebelled against the will of The Primordial and as such, had set himself against his peers. It is said that Luth was the only Pantheon God who took counsel from The Primordial from time to time.

## Biography

Luth was eldest of the Firstborn that best understood the will of The Primordial. Luth by contrast was entirely unconcerned with his own power, and wished only to prepare the world for the coming of the Aenveladi. He oversaw all of the The Pantheon's early attempts to order The World, but was unable to stop Tenebros's rampages until the Pantheon God Kor came to The World to assist his brethren.

Afterwards, the The Pantheon under Luth made an abode on The Mortal Lands in the Isle of Almaren and constructed the two Lamps of the The Pantheon to provide light to the world. But Tenebros destroyed the lamps, and the The Pantheon retreated to the continent of The Far West, which they heavily fortified. Eventually, the Amtreadi awoke in The Mortal Lands, and Luth at last went with the other The Pantheon to subdue Tenebros. They succeeded, and Tenebros was imprisoned in the Halls of Neth. He extended an invitation to the Amtreadi to journey to The Far West and live there amongst the The Pantheon. For the three Ages of Tenebros's imprisonment, the The Pantheon and the Amtreadi lived in peace and happiness. But eventually Tenebros was allowed to plead for pardon before Luth again.

As Luth was completely free of evil, he was unable to comprehend it, leading him to believe Tenebros's lies concerning his reformation. He released Tenebros from Neth, whereupon Tenebros began plotting the downfall of the Amtreadi and the ruin of The Far West's bliss. He began to cleverly spread lies amongst the Ñoldor, who soon grew to resent the The Pantheon because of said lies. Eventually, due to the rebellious actions of the Ñoldorin prince Faenor, Tenebros's lies were uncovered, but he escaped before he could be recaptured. Soon thereafter, Tenebros recruited the great spider The Webmother and poisoned the Two Trees. He then murdered Finwë Ñoldoran, stole the Starstones, and incited Faenor's leaving The Far West with most of the Ñoldor in rebellion.

Soon thereafter, Luth learned that the rebellious Ñoldor had attacked and slaughtered many of the Liinadi. As such, he forbade the Ñoldor from returning to The Blessed Realm once they left, and stated also that the Amtreadi would receive no help from the The Pantheon in their war against Tenebros. He then caused The Blessed Realm to be hidden by way of the Shadowy Seas and the Enchanted Isles to prevent the Ñoldor from returning.

To hearten the Eldar, he had Kang-Somer fashion the Sun and the Moon, for he knew the rising of the Atani was coming soon, and sent Thorondor and the Eagles to watch them. After Tenebros's fall, Luth cast him into the void. Luth dressed in blue robes and had blue eyes. He wielded a scepter of sapphire made for him by the Ñoldor. The Amtreadi were his favorite Amtreadi, and they lived with him and Gendei on Mount Holy Mountain.

## Ascended of Luth

- Bahamet, Luth's banner-bearer and herald.
- Valorin (Valdris), the second-in-command (and later leader) of the Wizards sent to The Mortal Lands to fight against Malachar, Luth comforted him when Valorin showed uneasiness and fear of Malachar's powers.

## Etymology

The name **_Luth_** means "blessed one" or "blessed person", from the High Amtreadan _man_ ("blessed") and _wë_ ("person").

**Súlimo** literally means "the Breather", from the High Amtreadan _súlimë_ ("wind") and Amtreadan _sûl_ ("wind").

His Amtreadan name was **Aran Einior**, the "Elder King".

### Titles

**\*Elder King**
**\*King of The World** and they were conceived as the parents of Bahamet (called **Fionwë Úrion**) and Co-un (called **Erinti**). the chronicler later abandoned this idea of the Children of the The Pantheon.

## Trivia

Luth shares many characteristics with the pantheon chief gods of world mythologies, particularly the Greek Zeus and the Norse Odin in the sense of being the associated with wisdom and the skies, and with St. Michael Archangel of the Christian religions in the sense of being second only to The Primordial in righteousness and authority after Tenebros's fall from grace.
