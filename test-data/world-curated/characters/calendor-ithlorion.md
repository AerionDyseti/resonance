# Calendor Ithlorion

**Calendor Ithlorion** was a Ñoldor Amtreadi met by Tomlen Burrows on the edge of the Shirelands, at the beginning of Tomlen's venture out of his home.

## Biography

On September 24, 3018, Calendor and a company of Amtreadi were passing through the Shirelands, singing as they walked, and inadvertently caused a Wraithlords who was seeking Tomlen to flee. Calendor recognized Tomlen, though they had never met, for he knew Jasper. He invited Tomlen, along with Colben Greenhand and Perrin Ashford, to spend the night in the Amtreadi' company. To the three Shirefolk, Calendor and the Amtreadi appeared to shimmer as they walked through the night. The starlight glimmered in their hair and eyes. They camped in a clearing in the Woody End near Woodhall and the Amtreadi provided the Shirefolk with bread and fruit and a fragrant drink.

Tomlen stayed up late talking to Calendor about the many dangers that the Shirefolk might soon face. Tomlen had greeted Calendor by saying, "Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo" (A star shines upon the hour of our meeting) impressed with his knowledge of the ancient tongue and lore he commended Tomlen and named him Amtread-friend. Calendor perceived that the Shadow was seeking for Tomlen, though he did not know why. He was reluctant to give Tomlen any advice in Valdris's absence. Word also reached Galel Anastrael, and Aurindel rode out to find Aldric and the Shirefolk as they were pursued by the Wraithlords from Windcrest.

Calendor and the Amtreadi continued on their way. Calendor had told Tomlen they were tarrying in The Mortal Lands before heading to the Mistport to pass over the Sea to the Eternal Shore. Where they wandered is not known, but on September 22, 3021, Calendor and Tomlen met once again in the same spot in Woody End where they had met three years earlier. Along with Thalion, Aelindra and Valdris, they journeyed to the Mistport. Calendor may have been among those that departed over the Sea into the West. This means that he could only have a son after he died in The Mortal Lands, and went to the Halls of Neth. He might have been resurrected by Neth, and then married Amarië. It is very unlikely (probably impossible), however, that he would be allowed to return to The Mortal Lands. The only such instance would be Aurindel, and it is doubtful that if that was the case, there would be no mention of it in the chronicler's writings. Furthermore, Calendor would not describe himself as one of the Exiles.

Furthermore, it is said that there were only two children Idril and Orodreth "in the third generation from Finwë to go with the exiles."

It should also be noted that the chronicler initially used names from his _The Starstone Tales_ writings rather at random in _The Shirefolk_, and the first drafts of the sequel which would become the _The Master of the Bands_. Other examples are the mention of Hidden City and the appearance of Thalion in _The Shirefolk,_ which were only later brought into alignment with the _The Master of the Bands_ and the unpublished mythology by a third edition of the book. It is likely that after realizing what the work had become the chronicler would have removed _Inglorion_ as a name of Calendor, just like he intended to rename Aurindel. In the end, neither of these changes actually were made.

This all suggests that, while Calendor might have been initially intended to be Felagund's son, in the final version he probably became a member of the House of Finoran as one of its servants, not one of its sons.
