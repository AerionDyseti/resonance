# Gorthak (Flamefiend)

__NOTOC__
**Gorthak** was the primary Lord of Flamefiends during the First Era, and the greatest Flamefiend ever to walk The Mortal Lands. He was High-captain of Iron Fortress, being Tenebros's front-line lieutenant as well as one of his most important servants. He fought many battles in the name of his master, and was personally responsible for killing two of the High Kings of the Ñoldor.

Gorthak, like the rest of his kind, carried a fiery whip into battle, but was also known for wielding a great black axe, feared by Amtreadi across Westlands.

## Biography

Gorthak was initially one of the Ascended who gave their allegiance to Tenebros. Prior to the revolt of the Ñoldor, he was High Captain of Iron Fortress, given the title "Lord of Flamefiends." Faenor pressed on to Iron Fortress with just a small company, and in that hour, the Flamefiends issued forth. Gorthak was among them. Faenor came even within sight of Iron Fortress, but was ambushed with few Amtreadi about him. Soon he stood alone, but long he fought on alone against all the Flamefiends. But at the last Gorthak, Lord of Flamefiends, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound, and the High King of the Ñoldor fell. The Sons of Faenor arrived and carried the body of their father away, but Faenor had passed. Gorthak reappeared as a general of Iron Fortress in several more major conflicts, including the Dagor Aglareb and the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. During the Nírnaeth, Gorthak engaged the High King of the Ñoldor, Fingon, in battle. Gorthak separated Fingon from the main host but was unable to kill Fingon (in earlier versions) until the second and lesser Flamefiend lord Lungorthin appeared behind the Ñoldorin king and "cast a throng of steel about him". This allowed Gorthak to slay Fingon and beat the body to dust. Thereafter, he captured Huran, father of Turan Turambar, and dragged him back to Iron Fortress.

In FA 510, Gorthak and the forces of Iron Fortress besieged the Hidden City of Hidden City. They breached the northern gates and were later confronted by Ecthelion of the Fountain, whom Gorthak dueled. Knocking Ecthelion's sword out of his hands, Gorthak prepared to strike at him, but, as he raised his axe, Ecthelion ran forward at the Flamefiend lord, ramming his pointed helmet into the beast's chest and forcing both of them into the Fountain of the King. The waters quenched the flames of Gorthak and drowned both him and Ecthelion, ending the Battle of Hidden City.
## Etymology
***Gorthak*** is a High Amtreadan name, of the terms *gos* or *goth* ("dread") and *-mbaw* ("compel, force, subject, oppress").

Gorthak's High Amtreadan name was **Osombauko**.

## In other versions
Gorthak was briefly conceived as an offspring of Tenebros and Ulbandi, an ogress, and went by the name of **Kosomot**. The root of the name *moko* translated to "hate".
