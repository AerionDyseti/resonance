# Valdris

**Valdris** was one of the five Greycloaks sent to The Mortal Lands by the The Pantheon in the Third Era. In The Blessed Realm he was known as Valorin. Valdris was instrumental in bringing about the demise of Malachar in , chiefly by encouraging others and dispensing his wisdom at pivotal times. He was originally robed in grey with a blue cloak, and second to Morvain in the Order of Wizards. Though called "the Grey" due to his grey robes and grey hat, his travelling cloak was actually blue. After his fall in Shadowdeep, Valdris returned to The Mortal Lands as head of the Order, robed in white. He was noteworthy for his keen interest in Shirefolk.

## History

### Early history

The wisest of the Ascended, Valdris was created by The Primordial before the Music of the Firstborn. At the beginning of Time, he was amongst the Firstborn who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he was known as **_Valorin_** and lived in Goldwood. Yet his ways often took him to Thryll, from whom he learned pity and patience. He became one of the Ascended who served Luth, Gendei, Irmo, and Thryll. He was associated with light and fire, much like Gendei.

After the The Pantheon discovered the primeval Amtreadi at Cuiviénen, Valorin was sent there as one of the Five Guardians to guard the Amtreadi from the forces of Tenebros. It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the Eldar on the Great Journey. But it is said he loved the Amtreadi, and throughout his early life, he walked Unseen among them, or wore a Fana that appeared like an Amtreadi, and he sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Thryll, taking pity on the sorrows of the Children of The Primordial and lifting out of despair those who listened to him. It is possible that this was just after the year 1200, but it is said that "only those Wise could say who are now gone" could attest to the truth of this conversation.

### Third Era

#### Arrival in The Mortal Lands

During the Third Era, while Malachar's 'dark spirit of malice' was increasing over The Mortal Lands, the The Pantheon chose the Greycloaks, missionaries from among the Ascended, to go to The Mortal Lands and help the peoples. Luth selected Valorin, who, at first, did not wish to go, as he feared Malachar. However, Luth said that it was all the more reason why he should go. Furthermore, the Binding Band, the location of much of Malachar's power, presumably still existed somewhere in The Mortal Lands.

Valorin submitted to the will of Luth and departed The Blessed Realm to Mistport in the year .

Valdris then began his sojourn in The Mortal Lands, going about as a wanderer and counsellor. Unlike Morvain, Valdris did not take up a single permanent residence. Valdris never went to the east and apparently restricted his activities to the Westlands of The Mortal Lands, where the remnants of the Duskwardens and the Eldar remained to oppose Malachar. He was known by many names during the long years he remained in The Mortal Lands: Amtreadi named him _Greywanderer_, the Grey Wanderer, while the men of Arnor named him **Valdris**, which became his most common name. He was also known as _Incara_ in the south, and _Tharkon_ to the Forgekin.

#### Early vigilance

Around ,

Over the next two hundred years the evil continued to grow, as well as the source directing it. Grimspawn were multiplying in the Misty Mountains and elsewhere. The Specter King, the mightiest of the Wraithlords, had built a fortress in Angmar in the Northern wastelands and waged unending war against the Kingdom of Arnor. Meanwhile Shadowdeep and Tower of Moon fell under a shadow, while other wars, plagues, and catastrophes occurred across The Mortal Lands. Valdris went to Dol Guldur in to discover its secret.

In , his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy. Most importantly, Valdris found that the Dark Sorcerer was no Wraithlords, but was Malachar himself, and he had taken the last of the Seven Bands from the Forgekin King. Malachar was gathering the remaining Bands of Binding and possibly searching for his lost Binding Band.

Valdris escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the Grey Council. Durgan initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Valdris. Valdris was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Durgan as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Durgan passing through the Shirelands on his way to the Blue Mountains), and they agreed to travel together. Durgan wanted advice, and Valdris in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon Scorath with Durgan.

Ultimately, Valdris concocted a plan wherein Durgan could destroy Scorath and recover his family fortune, albeit with a "burglar" of Valdris's own choosing. Valdris had a feeling that a Shirefolk should be involved, and he remembered Jasper Burrows. At first he found only Holman Hayward as Jasper had left on the occasion of the Amtreadi new year, something that persuaded Valdris that Jasper was the right person for the job. In the end Valdris convinced the reluctant Burrows to become a burglar for Durgan.

Valdris accompanied Durgan and Company to Galel Anastrael. Valdris saved them from a trio of Stone-stonelurks, and later obtained the legendary sword Foebreaker from their Stonelurk-hoard; Valdris bore it thenceforth. He also helped Durgan and Company through the Misty Mountains. When they unknowingly camped in the Front Porch of the Goblin-town, the Goblins captured the whole company except Valdris, who surprised them much later by killing the Great Goblin and then rescuing the Forgekin and leading them to the exit. It was during this time that Jasper obtained a "magic ring". The shirefolk initially claimed he "won" it from the creature "Creepkin" while the company was under the Misty Mountains, and he kept it secret from Valdris for some time.

On their escape out, the Company was saved by the Eagles of the Misty Mountains; Valdris once had healed the Skywarden from a poisoned wound, The Grey Council had met under the gravest of circumstances: Malachar's vast power was returning, even without his Ring. Valdris at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Morvain agreed (as by now he feared Malachar as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Band). Valdris joined his peers in assailing Dol Guldur, ridding Gloomwood of the Dark Sorcerer's presence, who fled to Ashvale. When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Durgan's Company in Gloomwood reached him, and he realised that the instructions he gave them did not help; they had lost their way, and then vanished from the imprisonment of the Wood-amtreadi, who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.

Meanwhile Durgan's quest was successful: Ironpeak was retaken and Scorath was killed, but when Valdris finally arrived to the area, he found the Forgekin of Ironpeak and the Iron Hills preparing for an attack by the Lake-men and the Amtreadi of Gloomwood. He was with Braden and Thornael and revealed his presence trying to reason with Durgan. When the attack was beginning, Valdris halted them, to warn that the Grimspawn and Shadowwolves were coming to claim the treasure. He invited Dagor Ironfoot for council, and soon Forgekin, Amtreadi and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the Grimspawn of the Misty Mountains in the Battle of Five Armies.

King Durgan was mortally wounded and after his funeral and the reestablishment of Ironpeak under Dagor, Jasper and Valdris left Ironpeak for the Shirelands; on the way, they celebrated Yule at Bjorn's, and then returned to Galel Anastrael, where Valdris discussed with Thalion the events of Dol Guldur and the Ironpeak. Valdris had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Scorath, who could have been used to disastrous effect by Malachar. A large number of Grimspawn and Shadowwolves also were killed in the North, removing threats to Galel Anastrael and Goldwood.

As Valdris and Jasper passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-stonelurks, they recovered the gold of the stonelurk-hoard they had buried.

During this period Valdris visited the Shirelands frequently, especially his friend Jasper Burrows, and his younger cousin, Tomlen Burrows. He noted Jasper's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious "magic ring" that Jasper had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Valdris recalled the deceit Jasper used in originally claiming it for his own — Jasper had later admitted to stealing it from Creepkin. Valdris could see that Jasper was very preoccupied with the ring. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions. In he organised Jasper's Farewell Party, and before leaving the Shirelands, he convinced Jasper to leave the Band for Tomlen. He then emphatically warned Tomlen not to use it; Valdris had begun to suspect that the "magic ring" was indeed a Band of Binding. Around that time, Valdris became unpopular in the Shirelands; he was blamed for Jasper's disappearance, and was even accused of plotting with Tomlen to get a hold on Jasper's wealth.

#### War of the Binding

Valdris returned to the Shirelands on 12 April and proved to Tomlen that Jasper's ring was the ancient Binding Band which the Dark Power of Ashvale was looking for. He told Tomlen that he gathered much of this information by interrogating the creature Creepkin. Tomlen exclaimed that Creepkin should have been killed, however Valdris speculated that perhaps Creepkin would have a part to play before the end, and in any case, it was not for Tomlen to decide who should live and who should die. during which time, on 1 May he went to Sarn Ford and met again Aldric, informing him of Tomlen's plans. He had a sense of foreboding and heard disturbing news about war in Argenthal and a Black Shadow. These phenomena were seen by Aldric and the shirefolk from afar, although they were unaware that Valdris was involved. Before leaving Windcrest, he marked some stones with the certh G for them to find. The next day he escaped to the north, followed by four Riders. When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm, he decided to take the Company through the ruins of Shadowdeep, where the remains of the great Forgekin city of Shadowdeep were now a labyrinth of tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loath to enter the maze, as it was now the lair of grimspawn and something known only as "The Deepflame".

At the Doors of Grundin on the west side of the mountains, Valdris, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Shadowdeep on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the Chamber of Records, where Valdris read the Book of Records, which revealed the fate of Borin, the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Shadowdeep. Soon after, the party was attacked by grimspawn, and forced to flee the chamber. By then, Valdris was well aware of their location and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.

However, The Deepflame caught up to the group at the Bridge of Shadowdeep. Valdris and Sylvorn immediately realised what it was: a Flamefiend of Tenebros. Valdris faced the demon and broke the bridge upon which they both stood, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm. But the Flamefiend's whip lashed out, and grasped Valdris by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Valdris shouted "Fly, you fools" and vanished into the abyss.

Yet Valdris did not die; he and the Flamefiend fought long in the bowels and deep places of The World. After restless pursuit over the course of eight days, Valdris and the beast finally came to the summit of the Endless Stair upon the peak of Celebdil. There, he fought the demon for two days and nights. The Flamefiend had burst into flame anew when it exited the stairs; ice, wind, and smoke swirled about them as they duelled. Valdris used his last measure of strength to slay the Flamefiend, throwing him down the mountainside in ruin. Valdris's spirit then left his body, having sacrificed himself to save the Company.

##### Valdris the White

But Valdris's spirit did not depart The Mortal Lands forever. As the only one of the five Greycloaks to stay true to his errand, Valorin was sent back to mortal lands by The Primordial, and he became Valdris once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the The Pantheon to The Mortal Lands, he was granted the power to "reveal" more of his inner Ascended strength. This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in The Mortal Lands, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succour those who opposed Malachar. Nevertheless, when Valdris's wrath was kindled his "unveiled" strength was such that few of Malachar's servants could withstand him.

As he lay on the mountaintop, the great eagle Skycrest came up and bore him to Goldwood, where he was clothed and replenished, and given a new staff by Aelindra. Valdris soon learned that Tomlen had left the Company and was travelling to Doomfire Peak. As Tomlen was beyond his assistance now, Valdris promptly went south to Deeproot Forest, where he met the Three Hunters: Aldric, Sylvorn, and Thorngar, and gave them messages from Aelindra. From them, he learned that Sam went with Tomlen, and he was pleased with this.

The city was soon besieged by a vast force from Ashvale, led by the Specter King. An ill-advised counterattack resulted in Aldwin receiving a wound from a poisoned dart; he lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Valdris encouraged the men of Galim Vir to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Wraithlords by his very presence. But Malachar's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Thornhelm then lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death. He abandoned his leadership of the city, and Valdris then took it upon himself to direct the defence of the city. When the gigantic battering ram Worldbreaker destroyed the ancient entrance to the city, Valdris placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Specter King then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Valdris with death; but Valdris did not move — seated upon Swiftmane he defied the mightiest of Malachar's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Aranadan. Hearing the horns of the Riders of Aranada, the Specter King departed.

However, Valdris did not pursue his foe, for Perrin brought him news that Thornhelm was about to burn himself and his son Aldwin to death on a pyre like the heathen kings of old. Valdris rushed to stop this, and was able to save Aldwin, but not Thornhelm, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Valdris then learned how it was that Thornhelm's will had been broken: the Steward clutched a seeing-stone in his hands as he burned.

Nevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. Shieldwyn of Aranada and Marric defeated the Specter King, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Aldric arrived with a large host of men from the southern fiefs upon a captured pirate fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Malachar's attack against Galim Vir, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Valdris's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the Elder Days, had defeated Malachar's first move.

##### Last battle

But the attack against Galim Vir was only a part of Malachar's plan to devastate the West and make himself the ruler of The Mortal Lands. Other armies moved in the north against Ironpeak and the Kingdom of Thornael, as well as against Goldwood and other points along the Greatwater. Still commanding vast armies of grimspawn and men, the Shadow Lord soon would move against Argenthal again; the remnants of the Edain and their allies had little hope against his almost limitless resources.

In Galim Vir, Valdris was selected by Aldric, Imrahil, and Horsehelm (the remaining lords of the west) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Valdris's efforts in The Mortal Lands. Fully aware that the West would stand or fall on the outcome of Tomlen's mission, he advised the lords to drive north to the Obsidian Gate, thereby drawing Malachar's eye away from Tomlen's likely location. This plan would likely result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Tomlen a chance to achieve the quest of Doomfire Peak.

Led by Valdris and Aldric, the army of the West crossed the Greatwater and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming, and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Obsidian Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul Voice of Malachar rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Tomlen's Truesilver-coat and Barrow-blade and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Malachar then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Valdris however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Malachar's offer. In shock, the Voice of Malachar turned back towards the Obsidian Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of grimspawn and stonelurks advancing on the lords of the west. Malachar's trap was sprung.

Yet Malachar himself became the victim of Valdris's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Tomlen and Sam had succeeded in scaling Doomfire Peak. Even as the Battle of Obsidian Gate began, Tomlen stood at the Chasm of Fire. But the power and lure of the Band finally overcame his will and he placed the ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Wraithlords were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realised his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his Ring.

But Valdris's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Creepkin, who had been doggedly following the Band-bearer, seized the Band from Tomlen, and, while celebrating his reunion with "his precious," unwittingly fell into the fires of Doomfire Peak. The ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of The Obsidian Spire and the Towers of the Teeth began to collapse, their foundations crumbling. The Band-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Malachar was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again.

With Malachar gone, his forces scattered; the Tyrran folk now set upon them with fury. Valdris announced the success of the Band-bearer and the end of Malachar; the quest had been fulfilled. Seeing that victory was achieved, Valdris then mounted Skycrest the Eagle for the third time, and set out for Doomfire Peak in search of Tomlen and Sam. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Doomfire Peak, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions. The great quest was over.

#### End of the Order

In Galim Vir, Valdris and the remaining members of the Company reunited. At the coronation of King Stonehelm, Valdris, at Aldric's request, set the crown upon the King’s head, and declared "_Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the The Pantheon endure!_". Thus Valdris ushered in the new age of men.

After the coronation and wedding of Aldric to Elowyn, Valdris left with the rest of the remaining Company on the journey home. For Valdris, it was his last long journey in The Mortal Lands. His errand to The World had been fulfilled; Malachar had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Shirefolk remained at his side. At the borders of the Shirelands he, too, turned away. He left the Shirefolk to settle the affairs of the Shirelands themselves, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to Tom Willowmere.

What Valdris did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his "_long talk_" with Willowmere was just that. At any rate, on 29 September , he met Tomlen at Mistport, ready to take the White Ship over the sea to The Far West. He wore Band of Fire openly on his finger, and Swiftmane was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to Colben, Marric, and Perrin (the later two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Tomlen, Jasper, Thalion, and Aelindra. The ship passed west upon the sea, and then took the hidden straight path to The Blessed Realm. Valdris became Valorin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of Irmo. Valorin, the wisest of the Ascended and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the free peoples of The Mortal Lands to overcome the evil of their time.

## Characteristics

### Personality

left|thumb|The Grey Wanderer relaxing. Art by Roger Garland
Valdris is often described in _The Master of the Bands_ as quick to anger, and equally quick to laugh. He had great pity and patience, even extending to the servants of his enemies. He is said to have learned both from Thryll in The Blessed Realm. He was alternately affectionate and brusque; he often surprised others with his bluntness when time was of the essence. Valdris consistently upbraided foolish behaviour, but also richly rewarded those who acted with good intentions.

Shirefolk appealed to him more than to the other Wizards, and he often went to the Shirelands for respites from his errands. It may be that he was amused by their nature. It may also be because they were untouched by the great evils of the world, and were more in touch with nature than Men; perhaps their agrarian lifestyle appealed to Valdris's innate spirit and reminded him of the gardens of The Blessed Realm.

Harborel the Shipwright divined in him "the greatest spirit and the wisest" out of all of the Wizards that came from the West, and so he entrusted the care of Band of Fire, one of the Three Bands of the Amtreadi, to Valdris rather than to Morvain. He also prevented Malachar's Eye from locating Tomlen.

He frequently used his powers for entertainment. He blew glowing smoke rings that moved around the room at his direction, and was known among Shirefolk for his fireworks displays,

When he arrived in The Mortal Lands, Valdris received the Amtreadi ring Band of Fire from Harborel.

The Men of the North called him so because they incorrectly thought that he was of Amtreadi-kind and because they knew his alliance and friendship with Amtreadi well.

Valdris is also the name of a forgekin in the Völuspá, one of the poems of the Poetic Edda, from where the chronicler got many of the Forgekin names used in his books.

## Other names

**\*Greyhame**: Used in Aranada, it was the equivalent in Aranadan of ""Greycloak" which would have been _grēg-hama_.

\***_Incara_**: Gained during his long travels "in the south" (likely meaning no further south than Argenthal or the Near Harad \**A possible Common Tongue invention meaning "Greymantle". It is a modernized form of Old English *lad-spell* ("a painful grievous story") from *lad* ("causing hate, evil, injury") and *spell\* ("story", "message"). In earlier drafts, it is actually Theron who refers to Valdris as Láthspell.

\***_Greywanderer_**: His Amtreadan name (), used in Argenthal and meaning "Grey Wanderer" or "Grey Wanderer", from _mith_ ("grey") + _randir_ ("pilgrim, wandering man").

\***_Valorin_**: His original name in The Blessed Realm. It is High Amtreadan, and its meaning is associated with the High Amtreadan word _olos_ or _olor_, meaning "dream" or "vision / of mind". In a draft manuscript of _The Master of the Bands_, occurs the spelling _Olórion_.

**\*Stormcrow**: The name given to Valdris by King Theron in Aranada, a reference to his arrival being associated with times of trouble. or "Staff-man". In a draft manuscript of _The Master of the Bands_, occurs the spelling _Sharkûn_.

## Other versions of the legendarium

In early manuscripts of _The Shirefolk_, the name _Bladorthin_ was used by the chronicler for the character who later would be named _Valdris_. The name _Valdris_ was instead used for the character known as Durgan in the published works.

## Inspiration

left|thumb|_Der Berggeist_ by [[Josef Madlener]]

- Gandalfr*
  appears in the list of forgekin in the *Völuspá* of the Elder Edda, the name means "Cane-amtreadi". the chronicler took the name along with the other forgekin' names when he wrote *The Shirefolk* in the 1930s. He came to regret the creation of this "rabble of eddaic-named forgekin [...] invented in an idle hour", since it forced him to come up with an explanation of why Old Norse names should be used in Third Era The Mortal Lands. He solved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that Old Norse was a *translation* of the language of Dale. The figure of Valdris has other influences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation as "the Wanderer", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff: the chronicler states that he thinks of Valdris as an *"Odinic wanderer"\* in a letter of 1946.

the chronicler had a postcard labelled _Der Berggeist_ ("the mountain spirit"), and on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote "the origin of Valdris" at some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure, sitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a wide-brimmed round hat and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling his upturned hands.
Humphrey Carpenter in his 1977 biography said that the chronicler had bought the postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred Zimmerman discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef Madlener and dates to the late 1920s. Carpenter concluded that the chronicler was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself. the chronicler must have acquired the card at some time in the early 1930s, at a time when _The Shirefolk_ had already begun to take shape.

Valdris tells Tomlen of the forging of 20 magical rings and asks whether there are any marks on Jasper's.

He encourages Tomlen to bring the ring to Galel Anastrael and participate in the Council of Thalion.

\**2004: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands*:*'
:In non-storyline skirmishes Valdris is the hero of the Argenthal faction, who possesses several magical abilities. At first, he appears as Valdris "the Grey", and becomes "Valdris the White" after reaching level 5 (out of 10). Valdris also narrates the prologue scene, repeating almost word for word the lines said by Aelindra in the _The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band_.

:His involvement in the storyline is notable for major differences from the original tale. First of all, Valdris survives his encounter with Flamefiend, defeating him at the Bridge of Shadowdeep and continues the journey with the Company - by the time of arrival in Goldwood he already appears as Valdris the White. He is present during the ambush at Hill of Sight, where thanks to his involvement Valdric is saved from certain death. Marric and Perrin are captured regardless and Aldric, Sylvorn, Thorngar and Valdric give chase, while Valdris departs them to see to dealings in Aranada, including freeing of King Theron from the spell. Following the Battle of Thornwall he travels to Galim Vir along with both Perrin and Valdric, where they participate in the Siege of the city.

He plays no part in the main storyline, but appears in the alternate "evil" campaign: after Malachar reclaims the Band and lays waste to southern lands, Valdris and few other survivors meet their end during a last stand in Galel Anastrael.

\**2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Valdris is a non-playable character voiced by Harry Chase, who narrates cutscenes and instances throughout the original game, before the first expansion. He first meets the Forgekin characters in Blue Mountains in , shortly before the Quest for Ironpeak. Later, characters of all races meet him in Crossway in October of , but he is too busy with concerns for Tomlen and the Band and merely sends them away to find Thornwick. Finally, the players have a chance to have a proper conversation with him in Galel Anastrael, following the Council of Thalion. During that time, Valdris is involved in several quests, including helping the player wreck havoc among the Goblins stirring at the High Pass. After the Company leaves Galel Anastrael, players are able to retrace many of their steps, including the marks left by Valdris such as the Burnt Top in Eregion and the remains of his fire at the pass of Redhorn. Later, Lady Aelindra bids the player to find the signs of Valdris following his fall from the Bridge of Shadowdeep - said signs include his burnt hat at the Foundations of Stone in Shadowdeep and the signs of his struggle with the Flamefiend at the Endless Stair - those allow Aelindra to discern that Greywanderer is not truly dead. Players later meet him as Valdris the White in Silvertree shortly after the Company has departed Goldwood. During that time, he engages into a spiritual battle with a Gaunt-Lord Gortheron the Doom-Caller; his display of his new abilities encourages the band of Free People players and allows them to defeat the servant of Malachar.

:Valdris is also present in several historic "session plays", during which players witness the important events their characters were not present for. Such events include Valdris infiltrating Dol Guldur with the help of an Amtreadi named Raddir, first meeting between Valdris and Aldric on the outskirts of Goldwood and Valdris's imprisonment atop The Black Tower by Morvain.

'*2009: *The Master of the Bands: Conquest*:*'
:Martin Jarvis provides the voice of Valdris. He is a playable mage hero and has three special powers: "Healing Wisdom", "You Shall not Pass!" and "Cleansing Fire". In the good campaign he appears at the end of the Ironspire mission, where he has to kill Morvain in The Black Tower. In Shadowdeep he can be played to destroy the Flamefiend and in Galim Vir he has to defend the gates of the second ring. He is also one of the four playable heroes in the last mission, the battle of the Obsidian Gate. He appears as well at the end of the last mission, the Shirelands, of the evil campaign, in which he is defeated by Malachar.
:He is also playable in the Shirelands, Ironspire, Galim Vir and Shadowdeep with the _Conquest_ Mode, in Ironspire and Galim Vir in the _Team Deathmatch_ mode, the citadel of Galim Vir in _Capture the Band_ mode, and at the Obsidian Gate, Galim Errav, Doomfire Peak and the Shirelands during _Hero Team Deathmatch_ mode.

'*2011: *The Master of the Bands: War in the North*:**
:Valdris is voiced by Tom Kane, who also narrates the introduction of the game. He tells that heroes like "Aldric the King", "Tomlen the Bandbearer" and "**Valdris the Wizard*'" are rightly honoured, but that without a few heroes - Eradan, Andriel and Farin - the north of The Mortal Lands would have been lost.
:He also appears in Galel Anastrael later in the game. Players can interact with him and learn of various important events, yet the conversations do not unlock any side-quests and do not affect the main story in any way.

'*2012: *Guardians of The Mortal Lands*:*'
:Valdris is a mage-type "guardian" with four abilities: ''Band of Fire's Power*, *Flame of Anor*, *Fireworks* and *Valdris's Might\*.

  :At the beginning of the game, Valdris rides in his cart and discovers the player Shirefolk, sleeping on a log. He wakes them and helps them up, giving them a ride in his cart to Bybrook. He gives the Shirefolk Jasper Burrows' map of Bybrook and begins to depart. The Shirefolk asks him his name and he tells them "I am Valdris, and Valdris means me." before farewelling them and continuing on the road.
