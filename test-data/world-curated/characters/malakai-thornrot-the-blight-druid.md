*Malakai Thornrot, a disgraced herbalist, creates monstrous hybrids using druidic magic and alchemy, causing chaos in Outwall. Leads include disappearances, fungal growths, and attacks, with potential allies like the Stoneguard and Herbalists' Guild.*

## Background

Once a respected herbalist in Four Corners, Malakai Thornrot's obsession with accelerating natural growth processes led him down a dark path. After being expelled from the Herbalists' Guild for conducting unethical experiments, he retreated to the tunnels beneath Midgarden, where he now pursues his twisted vision of "perfecting" nature through corruption.

## Current Activities

Operating from a hidden laboratory in the underground tunnels, Thornrot combines druidic magic with forbidden alchemical practices to create monstrous hybrid creatures. His experiments frequently escape into Outwall, where they have claimed several victims among the poorest residents.

## Monstrous Creations

- Thornweavers - Masses of animate thorny vines with a carnivorous appetite
- Rot Hounds - Dogs mutated by fungal infection, spreading spores with each bark
- Plague Beetles - Swarms of insects that carry a flesh-eating disease
- Blightspawn - Humanoid-plant hybrids that release toxic pollen

## Plot Leads

### Initial Hooks

- Multiple disappearances reported in Outwall, with witnesses describing "moving plants"
- Strange fungal growths appearing in basement areas near Midgarden
- Unusual increase in sick animals displaying aggressive behavior
- Herbalists' Guild offering reward for information about stolen rare specimens

### Investigation Threads

- Follow the trail of fungal contamination through the sewers
- Investigate reports of strange lights and sounds in abandoned wells
- Interview survivors of creature attacks for common patterns

## Laboratory Location Hints

- Connected to natural caverns with bioluminescent fungi
