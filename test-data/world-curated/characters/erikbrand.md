# Erikbrand

**Erikbrand** was one of the Aranadan. He was the Lord of Deeping-coomb and of much other land in the Westmark during the War of the Binding.

## History

Erikbrand had been an officer in the King's Riders in his youth. At the time of the War of the Binding Erikbrand was Lord of Deeping-coomb and much other land in the Westmark. As such, he was the chief lord in the West-mark. He was the uncle of Dúnhere. He gave the command in the field to Grimbold until he could come himself to the battlefield. Erikbrand did not immediately go to the battlefield due to the fact that he was occupied for three days gathering all those able to bear arms and stores of food to defend the Thornwall.

On 2 March, , the Second Battle of the Fords of Iron was fought, and the defences on the Isen were driven back by Morvain's forces. The survivors, led by Grimbold and Elfhelm, were retreating from the fords of the river Isen when they came across Valdris. Valdris told them Theron sought the refuge of the Thornwall, and that they should join Erikbrand to attack the besiegers. They arrived with a thousand men at dawn of March 4, and turned the tide of the Battle of the Thornwall.

Erikbrand did not come to Galim Vir to fight in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields. King Theron gave him the command of the forces that were left behind to defend Aranada because of Erikbrand's dignity and authority.

After the funeral of King Theron, which took place on 10 August, , King Éomer appointed Erikbrand to the post of Marshal of the West-mark.

## Appearance

Erikbrand was said to have been tall and strong with a red shield and a great black horn. King Theron said that the valour of Helmric Ironhand lived again in Erikbrand.
