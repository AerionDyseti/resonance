# Astorion

**Ereinion Astorion**, born **Artanáro**, was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi and son to Orodreth. He was the last Ñoldóran in The Mortal Lands, and bore many titles, including **High King of the Amtreadi of the West**, King of the Eldar, King of Westshore, Lord of the Amtreadi, and the Lord of Eriador.

Astorion held the highest authority among the Amtreadi he ruled and was respected by both the Ñoldor and the Liinadi, considered a "High King" of Amtreadi in The Mortal Lands. He formed the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men with King Aldorion, and led the Amtreadi to war against Malachar. His death in this war marked the end of the Ñoldorin Kingdoms in The Mortal Lands, although some Ñoldor would remain in Galel Anastrael or the Mistport throughout the Third Era.

## Biography

### First Era

Astorion was born in YT 1481 in Eldamar as the son of Orodreth and grandson of Angrod and Eðellos, thus tying him into the House of Finarfin. When the Sons of Faenor committed the Third Kinslaying, Astorion received word of the sacking of the Havens of Sirion, but he and his host arrived too late to stop the Fëanorians, who fled after the battle was over. However the survivors of Sirion joined with Astorion and went with him to Balar, where they told him of Thalion and Elros' captivity. After the War of Wrath, the remaining Sons of Faenor vanished out of history. Maedhros committed suicide while Maglor disappeared without a trace, leaving Thalion and Elros alone. Therefore at some point Astorion welcomed Thalion into his ranks as his herald, after the latter chose to be one of Amtread-kind.

### Second Era

[[File:MellorianJ - High King of the Amtreadi.jpg|thumb|left|High King of the Amtreadi, by [https://www.deviantart.com/mellorianj MellorianJ]]]
In year 1 of the Second Era, Astorion remained in The Mortal Lands and established a realm in Westshore, which was geographically strong and secure against enemies. At its height, his realm extended eastward as far as the Misty Mountains and the western parts of Greenwood, though most of the Eldar remained in Westshore and in Thalion's refuge of Galel Anastrael.

Astorion had an alliance with the Men of Oldshore, especially with Tar-Aldarion (the Mariner), the Faithful and Aldorion. Astorion reigned as High King of the Ñoldor throughout the Second Era. During this time Astorion was given the seeds of mellyrn by Tar-Aldarion, King of Oldshore. But the seeds wouldn't grow in his land so he gave them to Aelindra before she left Westshore. She carried these seeds for a long time, finally planting them in Lindórinand ('Golden Valley'). When they grew there it was renamed Laurelindórenan ('Land of the Valley of Singing Gold'). At some point, Astorion and Thalion were approached by a stranger called Annavar, who called himself the Giver of Gifts. Fair seeming were his words and offerings, but Astorion perceived that this Annavar was not what he seemed. Therefore he refused to have dealings with him, and sent word abroad to all the Amtreadi that they should shun this stranger.

However Annavar was received in Eregion, where he taught the Amtreadi how to make the Bands of Binding. But Astorion's distrust was proven correct, as Annavar was Malachar in disguise, and the rings were tools for his wicked plans to dominate The Mortal Lands. Later on, Astorion was entrusted by Celebranor with the Amtreadi Rings Band of Air (Ring of Air) and Band of Fire (Ring of Fire), two of the Three Bands, which he passed on to his herald Thalion and his lieutenant Harborel prior to his demise in the War of the Final Alliance.

Malachar invaded Eriador in great force in the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar, destroying Eregion and laying siege to the Mistport. But Astorion was aided by the Oldbloods, then ruled by Tar-Minastir, who sent a great fleet which defeated the Shadow Lord's forces. Malachar, who barely escaped with a bodyguard, returned to Ashvale, where he laid low, gathering his strength, plotting vengeance against the Duskwardens. Over a thousand years later Malachar was again confronted by the Oldbloods and brought back as a prisoner to their homeland, leaving Astorion free to rule The Mortal Lands in peace. In Malachar's absence, Astorion's power grew to the point where Malachar was dismayed when he returned from the ruin of Oldshore. Yet the survivors of Oldshore, known as the The Faithful, arrived in The Mortal Lands and established the Realms in Exile, with Astorion befriending the High King Aldorion and building for him the three towers on the Tower Hills. A century later when Malachar attacked Argenthal, Aldorion and Astorion took counsel as to how they should deal with him. At length they decided to gather all of their hosts and attack Malachar before he could recover his strength, forming the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men.

The two kings spent several years training and assembling their forces before meeting at Windcrest. Crossing the Misty Mountains they were joined by Oropher of the Greenwood, Amdír of Goldwood and Grundin IV of Shadowdeep. Astorion's famed weapon was a spear named Snowpoint - which meant "Icicle"; none could withstand it. Joining up with the army of Argenthal led by Anareth, the Army of the Final Alliance confronted Malachar's forces in the Battle of Battle Plain, a long and bloody battle which ultimately resulted in victory for the Alliance. The Amtreadi and Men then passed through into Ashvale and laid siege to The Obsidian Spire for seven years. Eventually Malachar emerged and Astorion and Aldorion then duelled the Shadow Lord. During their struggle, Astorion and Aldorion inflicted enough mortal wounds on the Shadow Lord to destroy his body, though they received terrible wounds in return. This sacrifice allowed Valorian to sever the Band from the Shadow Lord's hand. But Astorion received severe burns from "the heat of Malachar's hand", and so he passed on to the Halls of Mandos. He was not known to have a wife, nor any children, so the kingship of the Ñoldor ended in The Mortal Lands and Harborel was from then on the Lord of the Mistport and Westshore.

Astorion was an Amtreadi-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing;
the last whose realm was fair and free
between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen.
His shining helm afar was seen;
the countless stars of heaven's field
were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
and where he dwelleth none can say;
for into darkness fell his star
in Ashvale where the shadows are.

:― From _The Fall of Astorion_, as translated by Jasper Burrows

## Etymology

**_Astorion_** was Amtreadan for "Star of Radiance", from _gil_ ("star") and _galad_ ("light, radiance").

His name in High Amtreadan was **_Artanáro_**, which means "High Flame". In Amtreadan, _Artanáro_ translates to _Rodnor_.

## Parentage

Astorion's parentage had many versions in J.R.R. the chronicler's legendarium:

- Astorion was originally, and briefly, conceived as a descendant of Faenor.
- In both and , he was the son of Fingon.
- In some notes in , it is stated that he had briefly been the son of Finoran Felagund. It was said that Felagund sent his wife and son away to the Falas for their safety. In this version, Aelindra was Astorion's sister and daughter of Felagund. However, the chronicler ultimately decided that Felagund was unmarried and childless.
- In another, Angrod had a son Artaresto (later called Orodreth) whom Finoran made his steward and succeeded in Deephold. His wife was a Amtreadan lady of the North, and had two children, Finduilas and Astorion, whom she called Rodnor.
- In the last, the name _Artaresto_ was replaced by _Arothir_ (Orodreth), which was the name of the nephew of Finoran and father of Astorion. Finduilas remained as Orodreth's daughter and became sister of Astorion.

A marginal note by the chronicler from around this time (the late 1950s) suggested that Astorion might have been the son of Fingon. This suggestion was taken up by the chronicler's son and literary executor Christopher the chronicler in the published version of _The Starstone Tales_, which states that Astorion is the son of Fingon. After the Battle of Sudden Flame and the ruin of Westlands which resulted in the death of his grandfather Fingalor, then High King of the Ñoldor, Fingon becomes the High King and sends a young Astorion to the Havens of the Falas under Harborel. This idea of Astorion being sent to the Havens was derived from material which the elder the chronicler had written at the time when he saw Astorion as the son of Finoran.

After the disaster of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the title passes to Fingon's brother Turgon. Tenebros assaults the Falathrim in great force after that battle but Harborel and Astorion manage to flee in their ships to the Isle of Balar. When tidings come to Balar about the sack of Hidden City and the death of Turgon, Astorion becomes the King. Astorion's name in the chapter "Aldarion and Erendis" in _Unfinished Tales_ was also changed by the younger the chronicler in order to keep consistency with the published version of _The Starstone Tales_. — in the original version of that work he was noted as being "_Finellach Astorion of the House of Finarfin_". Christopher later stated in that this decision to make Astorion a son of Fingon was an editorial mistake on his part, and did not represent his father's conception of the character. He suggested that it would have been better to have left Astorion's parentage obscure.

the chronicler's final decision for Astorion's parentage appears to have been that he was a son of Orodreth, who was at the same time changed from being a son of Finarfin to a son of Angrod. This conception, however, was never incorporated into the written stories of _The Starstone Tales_, and aspects of it — notably the downgrading of Orodreth into a son of Angrod — would have required considerable reworking of the existing text. In the official text of _The Starstone Tales_, Astorion receives the kingship as he is the son of Fingon, who in turn is the son of Fingalor.

## In adaptations

### _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

In the prologue sequence of Peter Jackson's , Astorion's death scene was deleted; however, he appears briefly fighting multiple Grimspawn with his spear before Malachar appears at the battlefield. He also appears briefly as one of the original three Amtreadi ring-bearers (along with Aelindra and Harborel), wearing Band of Air.

#### Non-canonical weapons

##### Armor

Astorion's armor was similar in composition to that of all Amtreadi of the Second Era (as seen in the prologue to the first film): a cuirass and fault of interlocking lames of steel plate over a hauberk of fine mail, together with pauldrons and braces. However, befitting his status as High-king, his armor was blued and etched with vine like tracery, and the plates were embossed with Tengwar symbols and included leather pants, which gave greater protection. At the throat, he wore a steel collar that bore his heraldic insignia, twelve stars on a midnight blue field. The color blue may have reflected an association with the sea; in any case, it was certainly a dye that was rare on The Mortal Lands, and it would have required a great deal of time and knowledge to locate enough flora or fauna with which to make it. His cloak was of a deep blue and his armor was golden, and instead of a helmet, he wore a golden crown, fashioned for him by Celebranor, who made the Bands of Binding.

##### Shield

The shield of the High-king was the same shape as the common Amtreadi shield, but like his armor it was more richly adorned: it was enameled in blue on and around the center jewel and decorated in gold with the twelve stars of his house. Because Snowpoint, his great spear, was wielded two-handed, it is likely that the shield was carried only to the field of battle rather onto it, to be left with one of Astorion's attendants. It may have been used by him when he fought with a sword.

### _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

In Amazon Studios' series , Astorion is a significant character, portrayed by Benjamin Walker.

At the series outset, Astorion is High King of the Amtreadi, ruling from the realm of Westshore. He authorizes Aelindra to lead an expedition into Forodwaith to search for evidence of Malachar's survival, though he places limits on the mission, which Aelindra's followers compel her not to exceed. At her return, he chooses to overlook her perceived insolence in attempting to defy his orders, and honors the company for their heroism with a ceremony, reciting a speech written by his herald, Thalion. As a reward, Astorion gives them the opportunity to return across the Sundering Seas to The Blessed Realm.

Thalion afterwards questions Astorion about his motives, to which Astorion expresses the belief that Malachar does indeed remain, but attempting to search him out could cause the Shadow Lord to become an even greater threat. However, Astorion encourages Thalion to focus on other pursuits, and gives him a new charge to accompany the Amtreadi-smith Celebranor back to Eregion and assist him in his quest to create a highly important new work.

What Astorion does not tell Thalion, however, is that he and Celebranor have discovered that a corruption is at work among the Amtreadi, manifesting in black veins growing on Westshore's trees. The solution, they believe, is to acquire vast amounts of the newly discovered _truesilver_, which is conjectured to have restorative properties from the remnant of Starstone light it supposedly contains. In an attempt to build goodwill with the Forgekin of Shadowdeep, the only location where truesilver could be found, Astorion invites Grundin IV to Westshore, where they speak over dinner. Thalion perceives Astorion is being untruthful to him, and the High King explains by asking Thalion to recount the apocryphal _Song of the Roots of Hithaeglir_, which details the supposed origin of truesilver as stemming from the battle between an Amtreadi warrior and a Flamefiend over a tree containing light from the last Starstone. Astorion attempts to persuade Thalion to reveal the existence of truesilver in Shadowdeep, though Thalion refuses, having made an oath to Grundin.

Some time later, Astorion comes to Ost-in-Edhil to ascertain if Celebranor has been able to devise a means to avoid their impending fading, and is informed that although Shadowdeep will not supply truesilver, Celebranor believes there may be a way to fashion the small fragment Thalion acquired to amplify its properties. Astorion believes time has run too short, and orders the Amtreadi of Eregion to begin preparations to return to The Blessed Realm. Thalion persuades Astorion to give them three months to create a satisfactory artifact, though the High King remains skeptical. With knowledge gained from Halbrand, who Aelindra discovers to be Malachar in disguise, Celebranor forges three rings: Band of Fire, Band of Water, and Band of Air.

Later, Astorion wears the ring Band of Air, that sends him visions of the Unseen World and provides him healing abilities. During the Battle of Eregion, he is captured but later freed.

### Video games

- In , Astorion appears in several flashbacks depicting the War of the Final Alliance. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than the film version, showing Aldorion and Astorion both battling and defeating Malachar at the cost of their lives.
- In , after Talion finds the stone from Doomfire Peak, Celebranor will state that he "watched Astorion die on the slopes of Doomfire Peak". This implies that he watched the battle from the wraith-world, where his soul resides in the game's internal canon. In the game's sequel, , Talion and Celebranor use his spear, having retrieved it from his resting place.
- Astorion is a playable character in , and can be obtained by finding him and buying him in a cave in Ashvale. He is styled after the movie interpretation of Astorion, but his equipment does not include a spear; he instead wields an Amtreadi sword and shield.
