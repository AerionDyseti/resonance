# Aldric II

**Aldric II**, son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as **Wanderer** and **Stonehelm**, was the 16th and last Chieftain of the Duskwardens of the North; later crowned **King Stonehelm Telcontar** (March 1, 2931 - FO 120), the 26th King of Arnor, 35th King of Argenthal and first High King of Argenthal and Arnor since the short reign of Valorian. He was a great ranger and warrior, and bore, as Valorian's heir, the shards of Starshatter, reforged and renamed Dawnblade ("Dawnblade") in the War of the Binding.

## Biography
### Early years

Aldric was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of Andúnië to Aldorion, High King of Arnor and Argenthal. Like all of the kings before him, he was Thalion's kin through the House of Elros.  His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to Fíriel, descended from Anareth, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aldric the last descendant of both Valorian and Anareth.

When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing Grimspawn. Aldric was afterwards fostered in Galel Anastrael by Thalion. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Aldorion and Heir of Valorian became known. Aldric was renamed "Estel" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.

Thalion revealed to "Estel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him the Band of Barahir and the Shards of Starshatter, but withholding the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aldric until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aldric met and fell in love with Elowyn, Thalion's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Goldwood where she had been visiting her grandmother Aelindra.

Later in 2980, he visited Goldwood, and there once again met Elowyn. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Band of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Elowyn pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Amtreadan lineage and accepting the Gift of Ilúvatar: Death. Creepkin, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Malachar's Grimspawn.

### War of the Binding

#### Escorting the shirefolk
Aldric returned with Valdris in the spring of TA 3018, and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when Valdris discovered the Wraithlords were seeking for Tomlen and the Band in the Shirelands. After Tomlen left Willowdale, Calendor Ithlorion informed Aldric that the Shadows were looking for him and Valdris was missing. Aldric continued to watch the Great East Road until Tom Willowmere and the four shirefolk came from the Barrow Hills. Following them to Crossway, he met Tomlen at the Inn of the Wanderer's Rest under the name "Wanderer," as the Men of Crossway called him. Though originally the shirefolk were suspicious of him, Barliman Butterbur brought a letter from Valdris that made them trust him. Aldric was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Oldbloods descent.

After the raid on Crossway, Aldric led the Shirefolk out of Crossway-land and through the Midgewater Marshes. While there, he saw Valdris's battle with the Wraithlords on Windcrest from a distance. When they themselves came to Windcrest, they discovered five of the Wraithlords had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the Wraithlords. After attempting to heal Tomlen with athelas, he led them across the Lone-lands towards the Trollshaws. They met with the Amtread-lord Aurindel who led them to the Ford of Bruinen. When the Wraithlords caught up with them and Thalion released a flood, Aldric and the Shirefolk kindled fire and flushed out those Wraithlords that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied Tomlen to Galel Anastrael.

During the feast of victory, Aldric was gathering news from Elloran and Elrodan, and later helped his friend Jasper compose his Lay of Aerendil. During the Council of Thalion, he revealed himself to Valdric as the heir of Valorian and described his capture of Creepkin. After Thalion decided that the Band must be destroyed in Ashvale, Tomlen took the burden upon himself. There, Aldric chose to join Tomlen, thus forming the Company of the Band, tasked with accompanying Tomlen in destroying the Band in the fires of Doomfire Peak. Besides Aldric, Valdris, and Tomlen, the company included Tomlen's cousins Perrin and Marric, his best friend Colben Greenhand, Sylvorn the Amtreadi, Thorngar the Forgekin, and Valdric of Argenthal. Aldric then led the company to Goldwood, where he visited Cerin Amroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady Aelindra gave him the Elfstone.

After Goldwood, Aldric and the Company sailed down the River Greatwater to the Greatfalls. Aldric attempted to catch Creepkin several times. Though his original plan was to set out for Argenthal and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for Tomlen after the loss of Valdris and was conflicted about what path to take.

While Tomlen continued his quest with Colben Greenhand, Aldric, Sylvorn and Thorngar went to Aranada to free Marric and Perrin, who had been captured by the Ironspawn in Morvain's service.

#### The Three Hunters
Aldric ran from Parth Galen across the width of Aranada in just four days. As they approached Deeproot Forest, the "Three Hunters" Aldric, Sylvorn, and Thorngar encountered Éomer, who had recently pursued and routed an Grim-band in the area. From Éomer, Aldric learned that the Grimspawn who had kidnapped Marric and Perrin had been destroyed and that the Shirefolk had not been found. Dejected, he led Sylvorn and Thorngar to the site of the battle. Clues led Aldric to believe that the Shirefolk might still be alive, and he led the Three Hunters into Deeproot Forest. They did not find the Shirefolk, but they did find Valdris the White, sent back to continue his struggle against Malachar. Valdris told the Three Hunters that the Shirefolk were safe with the Treewardens of Deeproot.

#### The Battle of Thornwall
Together, Valdris and the Three Hunters travelled to Horsehold, where Valdris freed Theron from Morvain's enchantment and helped him organize the Aranadan against Morvain. He allied with Theron and joined the king's Éored, journeying to Thornwall Keep.

Aldric, Sylvorn and Thorngar then helped the people of Aranada in the Battle of the Thornwall, in which they conclusively defeated Morvain's army. Afterward Aldric went with Valdris to Ironspire, only to find it in ruins by the work of the Treewardens. Aldric, being present with Valdris, Theron, Éomer, Sylvorn and Thorngar, negotiated in a final parley with Morvain. Morvain attempted to bend Theron to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with Morvain. Morvain also attempted to sway Valdris, but failed in this also, and even so Valdris offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness. Morvain refused to repent out of pride and to avoid seeming a rebel to Malachar, and thus Valdris broke Morvain's staff and banished him from the Order of Wizards and the Grey Council. After Morvain crawled away, Verin Snakewhisper threw the seeing-stone of The Black Tower at Valdris as he and the others were leaving. He missed, however, unable to decide if he hated Morvain or Valdris more, and thus ended the Battle of the Thornwall and the destruction of Ironspire. After Perrin revealed himself to Malachar in the stone, Valdris gave the seeing-stone to Aldric.

Not long after the Grey Company of Wardens arrived from the north, dispatched by Aelindra. With them rode Elloran and Elrodan and Halbarad, bearing a standard made for him by Elowyn. When Aldric returned to Thornwall Keep, he decided to draw Malachar out and used the seeing-stone to show himself and Dawnblade to the Shadow Lord, wrenching the Stone to his will after a long struggle with the Shadow Lord. However, this led Malachar to swiftly send out the forces he had long prepared to attack Silverspire.

#### Return of the King

In order to defend the city, Aldric travelled the Ghost Road, and summoned the Ghosts Men of Darkharrow who owed allegiance to the Heir of Valorian. It had been prophesied by Valorian and Malbeth the Seer that the Ghosts would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying Argenthal an age before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were defeated at the Battle of Pelargir.

Aldric, a small force of Wardens, and a large contingent of men and soldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Greatwater to Silverspire. When they arrived at the Battle of Silverspire Fields, Aldric unfurled a standard that Elowyn had made for him which showed both the White Tree of Argenthal along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the House of Aldorion. With the help of the southern forces the armies of Argenthal and Aranada rallied together and defeated Malachar's army.

The Steward Thornhelm II declared that he would not bow to a descendant of Valorian (years before, he had seen "Eaglecrown" as a rival to his father's favor and soon discovered his true identity) and burned himself to death during the battle, despairing of final victory. Aldric healed Aldwin, Thornhelm's last heir, Éowyn and Marric, who together slew the Specter King as well as many others. This won him the immediate recognition of Aldwin as rightful heir to the throne; his humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants of Argenthal's capital city. Aldric's healing abilities, moreover, were a sign to the people of Argenthal of the identity of their true king; as Ioreth said, *"The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known."* The people hailed him as King that same evening.

Despite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his claim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aldric decided to lay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively promoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were not out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for Argenthal at a time when the West needed to be united against Malachar. So, to avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following nights of March 15–16, he left Silverspire and symbolically refused to enter it again until he was crowned King on May 1.

#### Captain of the West
Aldric then led the Host of the West to Ashvale as per the advice of Valdris and Thalion, to divert Malachar's attention from Tomlen and Sam. They marched over the Greatwater river and came to Specterhold, and set fire to the fields there. Leaving a guard at the Cross-roads of the Fallen King, they began to march north along the North Road of Moonvale, and Aldric won a skirmish against some Grimspawn and Easterlings that tried to ambush them. They then reached the desert before Ashvale, and Aldric allowed those who were afraid to depart to retake River Keep. The Army of the West then reached the Obsidian Gate, and Aldric along with Valdris, Éomer, Imrahil, Perrin, Sylvorn and Thorngar rode up to it and called for Malachar to come forth. He then watched as the Voice of Malachar revealed Malachar knew about Tomlen and Sam, and saw Valdris's rejection of Malachar's terms. The Host of the West was then encircled by Malachar's forces, a vast army of Grimspawn and Men. Aldric then arranged the Army of the West defensively on two Slag-hills and the Battle of the Obsidian Gate began.

After the destruction of the Band and the defeat of Malachar, Aldric freed the slaves of Núrn and gifted them the entire land in southern Ashvale.

### As King of Reunited Argenthal and Arnor

Upon Malachar's defeat, Aldric was crowned as **King Stonehelm**, a name given to him by Aelindra and adopted by the people of Argenthal because of the Elfstone he wore. He became the **twenty-sixth King of Arnor**, **thirty-fifth King of Argenthal**, and the first **High King of the Reunited Kingdom**, though it would be several years before his authority was firmly re-established in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of Telcontar (Telcontar being High Amtreadan for "Wanderer"). Aldric married Elowyn shortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Argenthal and Arnor until 120 of the Fourth Era. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity within Argenthal and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and communication among Men, Amtreadi, and Forgekin, fostered by his vigorous rebuilding campaign following the war. Aldric led the forces of the Reunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and Haradrim, re-establishing rule over all the territory that Argenthal had lost in previous centuries.

During his coronation, Aldric spoke Aldorion's Oath: ''"Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!"'' ("Out of the Great Sea to The Mortal Lands I am come. In this place, I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.")

### End of Reign and Death

When in the year 120 of the Fourth Era, King Stonehelm realised his days were at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street. He said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion his crown and sceptre. Elowyn remained at Aldric's side until he died. A year after Aldric's death, Elowyn died in Goldwood of a broken heart. Eldarion began his reign as the second King of the Reunited Kingdom after his father's death.
***Longstride** - Used by Colben Greenhand and some of the Men of Crossway

### Titles
As king, Aldric had many titles:
***The Dúnadan**
***Chieftain of the Duskwardens** or **Lord of the Duskwardens of Arnor**
***Heir of Valorian**
***Heir of Aldorion**
***King of all the Duskwardens**
***King of the West**
***Envinyatar** - "the Renewer"

Quite soon the chronicler finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter, from the beginning introducing him as a "descendant of the ancient men of the North, and one of Thalion's household", as well as the name Aldric. While the history of Oldshore and the descendants of Elros and Aldorion were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and would come to be connected with *The Master of the Bands* as the character of Aldric developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second and Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association with them.

#### Further development
The development of Aldric's connection to Argenthal was long and complex, as was his association with Valdric. Initially it is said that Aldric's forefathers were the exiles of Oldshore who ruled over the people of Ond (the early name of Argenthal), but were driven out by the Wizard King "when Malachar raised a rebellion". The story of the two branches of Aldorion's descendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations only emerged gradually; at one time, the chronicler even seems to have conceived only three generations between Valorian and Aldric.

One significant feature which was not established until late stages was Aldric's relationship with Elowyn. When the chronicler first introduced Éowyn, the interest which she showed towards Aldric was not one-sided, with suggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story. Another proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge Theron, and Aldric would never marry after her death.

The first mention of Thalion's daughter, named Elowyn Dawnstar, was in reference to the banner which she made for Aldric, but the chronicler did not give any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references to her marriage with Aldric were made later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working on the appendices for *The Master of the Bands* that the chronicler recorded the published version of *The Tale of Aldric and Elowyn*.

A passing idea was that Aelindra gave her Ring to Aldric, and that he would accordingly be titled the "Lord of the Band".

#### Rejected names
The original nickname **Trotter** was retained for a long while, and the chronicler decided to change it to Wanderer only after the story was completed. There were also several experimental translations of Trotter to Amtreadan: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly being equivalent to Perrin (Millbrook). Instead of the latter title "the Dúnadan", High Amtreadan Tarkil ("Noble Man") was first used, synonym with Oldbloods.

the chronicler hesitated for some time about Trotter's "real" name. Although Aldric was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled, it was changed a number of times. At one point the chronicler decided that an Amtreadan name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aldric via Elfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing- representing "west". Later, however, a new plot element was introduced: Aelindra's gift of a green stone, and the chronicler reverted the usage to Elfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained into the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a translation of Stonehelm.

Among other names to be used instead of Elfstone the chronicler considered Elfstan, Elfmere, Amtread-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erikbrand, with various Amtreadan forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name of Aldric's father also passed through many transient forms: the chronicler intended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aldric before settling upon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim with Ingold.

## History and mythology
Richard J. Finn presented a paper entitled "Arthur and Aldric - Arthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on Medieval Studies". The are additional similarities between Aldric and Arthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings of Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aldric becomes King of Argenthal. Kings of the period in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh, still known as *Dùn Éideann* in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to Dúnadan. For "Men of the North", Goddodin was a far northern kingdom. Arthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long grey robe for which he was called "His Grey Eminence" - Valdris the White also wore a grey robe at Aldric's coronation to indicate he at one time was Valdris the Grey.

## In adaptations
### *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy

In  (2001 – 2003) directed by Peter Jackson, Aldric is played by Danish-American actor Viggo Mortensen, who took over the role from Stuart Townsend after a month of rehearsals. In these movies, Aldric must overcome his self-doubt to claim the kingship. This specific element of self-doubt is not present in the chronicler's books, where Aldric intends to claim the throne all along. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the role, but declined. Russell Crowe was also offered the role, but likewise declined.

In , Aldric takes on a greater role as the main protagonist. The movie sees him accept his title as king by inspiring, assisting and commanding his subjects, alongside Sylvorn and Thorngar. Aldric aids Theron and Aranada in the campaign against Morvain and Ironspire. He risks his life to inspire and save the world he had rejected; commanding Men and Amtreadi in the Battle of Thornwall to battle Morvain's army of Ironspawn. At the end of the film, Aldric encourages Aldking Theron to ride out and meet the enemy head on. With Valdris's intervention, the Ironspawn are overwhelmed and slayed. He is last seen watching over Ironspire. 

In the film, Theron's niece, Éowyn, develops romantic feelings for him, but he takes her lightly, as he loves Elowyn. After the battle, Éowyn is overjoyed to see that Aldric has survived, and embraces him. 

In order to ensure safe passage across Ashvale for Tomlen to fulfill his quest, Aldric then led the Army of the West out from Silverspire to make a diversionary feint on the Obsidian Gate of Ashvale itself in the Battle of the Obsidian Gate. Valdris had been given supreme command of the war effort after the Silverspire Fields, and acted as chief spokesman in the parley with the Voice of Malachar; but Aldric commanded the Allied troops during the battle and its aftermath.

#### Non-canonical weapons
In the film adaptation, Aldric never carries the shards of Starshatter as he did in the books, and only receives the reforged Dawnblade before entering the Ghost Road. Up until this time, Aldric uses a different, more basic sword that is never given a name. Attached to the scabbard of this sword is a small utility knife that Aldric uses in the wild country. 

Aldric also uses a long, curved dagger in battle, though a lot less frequently than his sword. This dagger is used for close combat and as a last resort if the sword is useless in a particular situation, such as when Aldric is knocked down or assassinating Malachar's servants. He received a curved dagger from Caelorn in the movie, upon leaving Goldwood. In  video game, Aldric uses his dagger as a finishing blow for his Final Judgment and Warrior Bane combos. 

Near the end of the first movie *The Company of the Band*, in the scene where Aldric fights the Ironspawn Captain Lurtz, Aldric uses his sword to deflect his Amtreadan dagger, which Lurtz threw at him after he stabbed him in the leg with it. This was not meant to happen as in the original script the knife was supposed to miss and hit the tree behind Aldric, though the mask Lurtz's actor was wearing restricted his vision, causing him to miss his mark and throw the knife directly at Aldric. Luckily he was able to use his sword to deflect the knife just in time. Peter Jackson decided to keep that scene rather than the one originally planned. 

-  Bow and arrows

Aldric's next weapon in his arsenal is his bow. This bow is rarely used at all. Aldric only uses it in Shadowdeep, shooting Goblins in the beginning of the Battle of the Bridge of Shadowdeep and while fleeing the Bridge of Shadowdeep. During these few scenes, Aldric shows that, though he does not have the expert bow skill and speed that Sylvorn possesses, he is still an effective shooter when he successfully brings down two goblins through small cracks in the door.

In  and *The Return of the King* video games, Aldric's missile weapon is his bow and arrows. In each case, Aldric has 30 arrows.

-  The Black Stone
Aldric's final weapon is the Black Stone. He uses it once in *The Return of the King* to summon the Oathbreakers and defeat the Corsairs of Umbar. He is not shown using it in the movie adaptation.

In , Aldric's special, heavy attack is to summon the Army of Ghosts.

In , Aldric's most powerful ability is to summon the Army of Ghosts, which appears as four abnormally large, invincible ghost units, who can kill infantry almost instantly, though they are weak against buildings. The only units capable of doing any sort of damage to the Ghosts are heroes, which even then get immediately wiped out.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
While not appearing physically in Peter Jackson's , he is alluded to by Thornael to Sylvorn in . In a departure from the books, he is stated to already be a Warden and well known among his people, rather than a ten year old child. Thornael only told him that the Warden's name was Wanderer and that he was the son of Arathorn, telling him that he would have to find out Wanderer's true name for himself.

Given that Aldric was 87 in *The Two Towers*, he would have been 27 during *The Shirefolk* film series, since the original trilogy omitted the 17 year gap between where Valdris leaves Tomlen and finds out about the Band's origin.

### Ralph Bakshi version of *The Master of the Bands*
Aldric was voiced by John Hurt in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film version of . Bakshi's Aldric, unlike all other portrayals that were to follow to date, has no beard. This actually conforms to a statement appearing in  that implicitly says that Aldric was not supposed to have one, due to his Amtreadan ancestry (Amtreadi did not grow beards). In a note written in 1972 or later, among the last writings of my father's on the subject of The Mortal Lands, there is a discussion of the Amtreadan strain in Men, as to its being observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended (it was a characteristic of all Amtreadi to be beardless. However, the chronicler actually wrote elsewhere that Amtreadi *did* have beards; in *The Master of the Bands* itself Harborel is described as having a beard. Also, some viewers and critics have said that this version of Aldric looks Native American though not necessarily to the detriment of the film.

### In Rankin/Bass' *Return of the King*

Aldric was voiced by Theodore Bikel in the 1980 Rankin/Bass animated version of , made for television. He first appears at the Battle of Silverspire Fields, leading the reinforcements from southern Argenthal.

### On stage
:Also see the Wikipedia stage article: *The Master of the Bands* (musical)

Aldric was portrayed by Evan Buliung in the three-hour production of , which opened in 2006 in Toronto, Canada. A scaled down revival, , also featured Aldric.

In the United States, Aldric was portrayed by Josh Beshears in the Cincinnati, Ohio production of *The Return of the King* (2003) for Clear Stage Cincinnati. At Chicago's Lifeline Theatre, Aldric was played by Robert McLean in the 1999 production of *The Two Towers*.
