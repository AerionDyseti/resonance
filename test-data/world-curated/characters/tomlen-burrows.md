# Tomlen Burrows

**Tomlen Burrows** was a shirefolk of the Third Era, the most famous of all Shirefolk in the histories for his leading role in the Quest of the Band. During this epic quest, he bore the Binding Band to Doomfire Peak and there destroyed it, giving him renown like no other Shirefolk throughout The Mortal Lands. He is also peculiar for being, as a Band-bearer, one of the only three Shirefolk to be granted passage from The Mortal Lands to The Far West, the Eternal Shore.

## History

### Childhood and youth

Tomlen, child of the respectable Dramon Burrows and Primrose Clearbrook, was born on 22 September of . After his parents died in a boating accident in , Tomlen went to live in Brook Hall with his mother’s relatives, the Clearbrooks. He grew up under the guardianship of the Master of Brookshire Rorimac "Goldfather" Clearbrook, who was his maternal uncle. Tomlen was caught several times stealing mushrooms from Farmer Turnip, who, on the last incident, thrashed Tomlen and set his three dogs to chase Tomlen from Bamfurlong to Brookbury Ferry. Tomlen was terrified of them afterwards.

Tomlen stayed in Brookshire until his "uncle" Jasper adopted him and took him in to live in Burrow's End, Jasper's house in Willowdale. He enjoyed life with Jasper, with whom he shared the same birthday - though others often called the old shirefolk "queer." Jasper taught him to read, and told him stories of the past, even giving him some instruction in the amtreadan tongue. Tomlen was the only one Jasper allowed to read his memoirs. Jasper made Tomlen his heir, frustrating the attempts of the disagreeable Sackwell-Burrowses, who coveted the estate of Burrow's End.

The two went often out for long walks along the lanes of the Brook-valley and talked about adventure; they were sometimes seen by Wandering Companies of Amtreadi, though the shirefolk did not see them. When they returned home, Jasper would tell Tomlen that the Road is like a massive river, and all porches are its "springs" and all paths are its "tributaries".

Tomlen and Jasper were comfortable and well off until . At this time, Jasper threw an enormous party to celebrate his 111th birthday, and Tomlen's 33rd, the date of Tomlen's coming of age. At this party Jasper gave his farewell speech, and made his long-planned "disappearance" and withdrawal from the Shirelands. Tomlen, who had been informed beforehand of the "joke", as Jasper called it, was spared the shock that afflicted the other assembled Shirefolk. Tomlen returned home as the new Master of Burrow's End, as per Jasper's will. He was greeted there by Valdris, who informed him that, among other things, Tomlen had inherited Jasper's magic ring.

### Master of Burrow's End

Tomlen took charge of distributing the presents Jasper had left for the other shirefolk, a long and tiring task. Then Valdris the wizard, who had come for the festivities, warned Tomlen not to use the magic ring, and to keep it secret and safe. Then he left, Tomlen knew not where, with his mind full of curiosity about the ring. A suspicion was growing in the back of the Wizard's mind, but Valdris did not yet know what it was.

Tomlen, meanwhile, was quite well off. He continued honouring Jasper every year along with his own birthday. He had also inherited some strange customs from Jasper, like wandering by himself at nights far from home in the hills and woods under the starlight. His closest friends at this time were Marric and Perrin, also Falco Millbrook and Fredric Barleycorn, and other cousins from the family of the Old Ashford. Like Jasper, Tomlen continued to look robust and energetic even in his forties, and dreamed of one day seeing mountains and wilderness; he often wondered what lay beyond the borders of the Shirelands, and as he grew older, he would travel further and further from home. His friends were worried, and suspected that he met Amtreadi and other strangers that had begun to be more common sights in the Shirelands. These strangers bore strange tales of unrest from lands far-off.

Still, he lived in peace and respectability for seventeen years, until Valdris returned with the dreadful revelation that the "magic ring" was really the Binding Band, weapon of Malachar, a thing of evil power thousands of years old. Furthermore, the Shadow Lord was now aware of its survival, and would be searching for it, as Creepkin had revealed - under torture - that it was to be found in the Shirelands. After a long discussion and a test by fire, which revealed the Shadow Tongue written upon the ring, the two agreed that Tomlen would have to leave the Shirelands for his own safety. Colben Greenhand, the gardener, was selected to travel with him. Valdris recommended Galel Anastrael as a destination, as the road was likely safe and the valley well-protected. He told Tomlen to take the alias Underhill while abroad. Tomlen was reluctant, but wisely followed the wizard's advice. He bought a house in Crickethollow as an excuse to head east.

Valdris stayed for two months while Tomlen worked out the details. At the end of that time the wizard left to "get some news", as rather disturbing tidings had come to his ears. He promised to be back for the farewell party. Meanwhile, Tomlen was not aware that some of his closest friends were watching him - Fredric "Fatty" Barleycorn, his cousin Perrin "Perrin" Ashford, Marric "Marric" Clearbrook, and Sam himself knew that Tomlen and Valdris were in some trouble concerning the Band, and that Tomlen was preparing for some adventure.

As autumn passed, Tomlen was waiting for Valdris, but did not return and Tomlen grew quite anxious. Marric and Fatty drove the cart of Tomlen's belongings ahead, while Tomlen still waited for Valdris. At the last possible day, he gave up waiting and departed with Perrin and Sam.

### Willowdale to Crickethollow

Less than a day into their journey, Tomlen, strangely nervous, requested that the threesome hide upon the approach of a horseman. The rider was dressed in black, riding upon a black horse, and making queer sniffling noises. Tomlen felt the urge to put on the Band and vanish, but just as he was about to give in, the rider departed at a trot. Colben then remarked upon the "Shadow Rider" that had spoken to his father, Gaffer Greenhand, some time earlier. This made Tomlen wish that he had waited for Valdris.

That night, they were again overtaken by a Black Horseman. This time it seemed to be able to sniff out their hiding place. But as it approached, it was driven away by the song of a group of Amtreadi. Their leader, Calendor, greeted the shirefolk warmly, and lauded Tomlen for his knowledge of their tongue. Tomlen tried to get information from Calendor on the Shadow Riders, but the amtreadi would tell him very little. Calendor foresaw that Tomlen would have many dealings with the Riders in the future, and urged him to flee them whenever he met them. He and his party left the Shirefolk before daybreak, while the three slept.

The next day the threesome agreed to stay off the road. After a brief scare when Sam sighted a Rider, they worried about losing their way. That evening they heard a terrible wail, and Tomlen distinguished words in it. Before long they came to Bamfurlong, the property of Farmer Turnip. Although Perrin knew Turnip, Tomlen recalled a scare he had received at a young age after caught stealing the farmer’s mushrooms, being threatened with the dogs. He froze when the dogs came forth from the house, but Turnip's hospitality soon won him over. When Turnip told of a Shadow Rider who had stopped at his house asking for "Burrows," and made several shrewd guesses, Tomlen grew uncomfortable. Turnip took them to Brookbury Ferry in his wagon. There they joined up with Marric. As they were ferried across into Brookshire, they caught sight of a dark shape on the landing from which they had come.

### Crickethollow to Crossway

When they reached the house in Crickethollow, the other shirefolk revealed their knowledge of the Binding Band and promised to stick with Tomlen on the road to Galel Anastrael. The next morning, leaving Fatty to housesit, they passed into the Old Forest. In time they were driven by the trees down to the Willowstream, where they were ensnared by Old Man Willow. Rescued by Tom Willowmere, the shirefolk came to his house. There they met Tom's wife, Silverbrook, and Tomlen was moved to poetry over her loveliness. He was interested in Willowmere himself, and several times tried to learn who he was. That night he dreamed of a white-haired figure on a pinnacle of stone, borne away by an eagle.

The next day Tomlen tried on the Band, after finding it had no effect on Willowmere. Not subject to the Band’s power, Tom nevertheless could see Tomlen. That night Tomlen dreamed once more, a dream he never forgot.

After bidding Tom and Silverbrook farewell, the Shirefolk went on and traveled through the barrow-downs. Becoming lost in the mist, they were taken by the barrow-wights, Tomlen last of all. Tomlen woke in the barrow to find the barrow-wight bending over his three friends. He rose and in a tremendous act of bravery and resilience took a sword and smote off the wight's hand. Then he summoned Willowmere with a song Tom had taught him. Willowmere drove the wight away and helped Tomlen wake the others. Tom gave the shirefolk ponies and escorted them all to the road before turning his face back toward the Willowstream. The shirefolk continued along the road to Crossway, where they took lodging at The Wanderer's Rest inn as Willowmere had recommended, with Tomlen registering under the name of Underhill as Valdris had suggested.

### Wanderer and Windcrest

While Marric went out to take a walk in the night air, the other shirefolk came down to the common-room and were introduced by the landlord Barliman Butterbur to the gathering, Tomlen under his alias. Tomlen asked if Valdris was present in Crossway, only to learn that he had not yet arrived. While Perrin and Sam enjoyed the drink and conversation, Tomlen remained withdrawn, soon falling into conversation with a curious ranger called Wanderer, who gave him a warning about letting his friends talk to much. Perrin began to tell about Jasper's Birthday Party, and Tomlen, at Wanderer’s encouragement and in an attempt to prevent the name of Burrows from being raised, began to sing _The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late_. This proved popular with the gathering, but unfortunately, as Tomlen relaxed, he fell from the table and the Band slipped on his finger, causing him to vanish.

Tomlen crawled over to Wanderer's corner and slipped off the Band, and said that he had rolled quickly to the side. The suspicious Breelanders, however, grew angry or frightened, and eventually all left the common-room. Tomlen and his comrades retired to their room, where they found Wanderer waiting to talk to them. Wanderer was honest and blunt, telling what he had overheard and what he knew of them, as well as warning them of the Shadow Riders and traitors in Crossway. He urged them to accept his aide by inviting him into the company. Tomlen was leaning to believe the ranger when Butterbur broke in, giving Tomlen the long-awaited letter from Valdris, undelivered by Butterbur’s forgetfulness. After some little bit of light was shed on the situation to the innkeeper, he swore to help the shirefolk in any way he could, as a friend of Valdris and one very much afraid of Ashvale. Tomlen, reading the letter, learned that Valdris recommended Wanderer as one to whom Tomlen could go for help. After some further debate, Tomlen agreed to let Wanderer lead them to Galel Anastrael.

Wanderer arranged for a deception, by moving them to a different room. The next morning, their ponies were gone and the room was ravaged. Butterbur paid for a replacement pony, and the four shirefolk and ranger set out into the Wilds. They passed through Chetwood and Midgewater Marshes, and finally to the Weather Hills before coming up to Windcrest. Shadow Riders were sighted from the top of the cairn, and Wanderer counselled to remain where they were. Shortly after the Shadow Riders came, and Tomlen was stricken down. In desperation he put on the Band and saw the Wraithlords in their true forms. Tomlen then tried to attack in Elbereth’s name, but their leader, the Specter King of Coldreach, stabbed Tomlen in the shoulder with a Specter-knife, before being driven away by Wanderer.

### Windcrest to Galel Anastrael

Because of a piece of the knife embedded in his shoulder, Tomlen started to become ill, so his companions hurried to take him to the House of Thalion. After journeying for 12 days, they were found by Aurindel, one of the Amtreadi, who was sent by Thalion to help Tomlen after he heard of him from Calendor. Aurindel, seeing that Tomlen was starting to fade, put him upon his horse, Starrunner, and ordered him to go on when the Wraithlords approached. Starrunner outran the steeds of the Wraithlords and bore Tomlen across the Ford of Bruinen, but Tomlen, who was on the brink of becoming a wraith, turned around at the other side and defied the Shadows. The Riders, were driven into the River by Aurindel, Wanderer and the three shirefolk, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters. As a sign that Tomlen was shifting to the Wraith-world, he could see the Unseen luminous form of Aurindel.

Unconscious, Tomlen was carried inside Galel Anastrael, where Thalion removed the fragment of the knife from his shoulder. He awoke two days later, mostly recovered, and was delighted to find that Valdris had arrived. Tomlen's recovery was celebrated with a feast during which he met Glorin and asked concerning the Forgekin of Ironpeak. Afterwards, Thalion led his guests to the Hall of Fire, where Tomlen found Jasper, whom he hadn't seen in seventeen years. Jasper asked to see the Band and was saddened to see Tomlen's negative reaction. The two shirefolk then enjoyed talking about Jasper's works on lore and the Shirelands.

### Company of the Band

During the Council of Thalion, it was decided that the Band must be destroyed by casting it into the Chasm of Fire. Tomlen volunteered to be the Band-bearer, and a Company was formed to protect him; the fellowship included Valdris, Aldric (Wanderer's real name), Valdric of Argenthal, Sylvorn of the Woodland Realm, Thorngar of Ironpeak, and Tomlen's friends Sam, Marric and Perrin. Before their departure, Jasper gave Tomlen his sword, Glimmer, and his Truesilver-coat to protect him on the perilous journey to Doomfire Peak that lay ahead.

On December 25, the fellowship left Galel Anastrael, and headed south along the west side of the Misty Mountains. They attempted to cross them by the Redhorn gate, but were thwarted by a fierce blizzard and had to go back. After surviving a Shadowwolf attack, Valdris persuaded the company to go through the abandoned Forgekin kingdom of Shadowdeep. Just before entering Shadowdeep, Tomlen was attacked by the Watcher in the Brook and barely escaped. During the journey through Shadowdeep, Tomlen began to suspect that something was tracking them. Later, inside the chamber of Mazarbul, the Company was attacked by Grimspawn, and Tomlen was struck by an Grimspawn spear but was saved by the truesilver coat he wore. The company escaped the chamber, and were close to exiting Shadowdeep, when The Deepflame appeared and pursued them to the bridge of Shadowdeep where Valdris held him off so the rest of the Company could escape. After breaking the bridge, both he and the Flamefiend fell and disappeared into the chasm below, after which Aldric took over as leader.

Eventually they reached Goldwood, and were housed by the amtreadi at Silvertree. During their rest there, Aelindra allowed Tomlen and Sam to look into the Mirror of Aelindra, in which they saw many things. When leaving the Woods, Aelindra gave Tomlen a vial with light from the Starstone of Aerendil.

They travelled down the Greatwater river in boats given to them by the amtreadi. On their trip down the river, Tomlen confirmed his suspicion that they were being trailed by Creepkin. At Hill of Sight, the Band's corrupting power caused Valdric to try to take the Band from Tomlen, who escaped by putting it on. Seeing the corrupting influence of the ring on Valdric, he then decided to leave the Company and go on alone, but he was thwarted in this when Sam discovered him attempting to cross the Nen Hithoel, and insisted on accompanying him.

===Stone Hills to Moonvale===
The two companions reached Amon Lhaw and toiled through the Stone Hills. Soon after, they found Creepkin following them, and they captured him with the Amtreadi rope.

Tomlen decided to trust Creepkin to be their guide. He led the Shirefolk out of the Stone Hills and through the Bonefens. During their route, they were delayed several times by a Wraithlords flying on a fell beast. The Shirefolk reached Carchost, the western Tower of the Teeth, where Tomlen had intended to enter Ashvale, but Creepkin persuaded Tomlen to follow him to a safer entrance, the pass of Spider Pass. During the next night's march they passed into North Moonvale, and by daylight of March 7 they reached the stream of Hidden Falls.

Their camp fire attracted the Wardens of Moonvale, and their leader, Aldwin (Valdric's brother), considered them spies and questioned Tomlen concerning their errand, who recounted the journeys of the Company, but said nothing about the Band. Aldwin informed Tomlen of Valdric's death, implying Tomlen's involvement. Aldwin blindfolded the Shirefolk and led them to Hidden Falls, a secret Solaaran outpost, and questioned them further in private. After a meal, Sam accidentally revealed that Tomlen had the Band, but Aldwin denied its lure, and thus gained the trust of the shirefolk.

During the night, Aldwin called Tomlen and Sam to him, and showed them Creepkin, who had found his way to Hidden Falls, and (ignorant of their presence) was hunting for fish. Aldwin, suspecting that Tomlen had lied about Creepkin's involvement in their quest, threatened to kill him for fear that he might reveal the location of their outpost to the enemy. Tomlen confessed to the part of Creepkin in their errand, and begged Aldwin not to slay him. Creepkin was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Tomlen. The following morning Aldwin released the three travellers, warning them strongly against taking the pass of Spider Pass.

### Entering Ashvale

After two marches they came to the valley of the Morgulduin and continued east. On the "Dawnless Day" Creepkin lead them east to the Southward Road and reached the Cross-roads just as the sun was setting. They reached just opposite the north-facing gate of Galim Errav and they saw the Morgul-host march forth.

In that night they ascended the Straight Stair and reached the top of the Winding Stair at dawn of March 11 where they were woken by Creepkin. He led the up the to the entrance to Venomweave's Lair. Inside the tunnel Creepkin betrayed Tomlen and Sam to Venomweave the spider, who stung Tomlen after he left the tunnel. Sam saved Tomlen from being eaten by Venomweave, but thought him dead and took the Band from him, resolving to continue the Quest alone. However Tomlen (who was still alive) was captured by Grimspawn and taken to the Tower of Spider Pass.

### Spider Pass to Doomfire Peak

Learning of this, Sam rescued Tomlen and on early March 15 the Shirefolk escaped and jumped into the ravine west of the Morgai and crossed the valley. The next day they attempted to climb the Morgai, but had to retrace their steps and reached the north end of the valley, and on March 18 they set out on the road that ran to the Isenmouthe. There they were overtaken by an Grimspawn troop and had to follow their trot.

As Malachar's troops moved at night, the shirefolk continued their journey in daytime towards Doomfire Peak. During the morning of March 25 they reached the Chasm of Fire where, at the last moment, Tomlen, under the influence of the Band, claimed it as his own. However, at that moment he was attacked by Creepkin, who seized the Band and then fell into the fire with it, thus destroying the Band.

By then, this pressure of the ring reached its maximum, which was impossible, "especially after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted." Tomlen had done what he could, and by then he was simply incapable of making a conscious decision to destroy the Band.

### Return home

Tomlen and Sam were rescued by Skycrest, Windcrest and Stormwing and taken to Moonvale. After being healed and having rested for a month, the Band-bearers were honoured on the Field of Cormallen. The following months the Shirefolk witnessed the coronation of their companion Aldric as King Stonehelm, and were present at his marriage to Elowyn that summer. Elowyn renounced her immortality and gave to Tomlen her place to sail into the West. She also gave to Tomlen a white gem on a silver necklace that she claims would aid him when he remembers the fear and darkness of the toll the ring took on him.

Tomlen and his company left Galim Vir on July 19 for Horsehold and the funeral of King Theron, then set out for the Thornwall and eventually Ironspire. They parted there from Sylvorn, Thorngar, and Aldric.

After overtaking Morvain and Snakewhisper, they reached the Mountains of Shadowdeep; and when they approached Goldwood, Caelorn and Aelindra parted from their company. The shirefolk, with Valdris and other Amtreadi, reached Galel Anastrael on September 21, where Tomlen met Jasper once again.

They stayed there until October 5 and eventually visited the _Wanderer's Rest_ in Crossway before reaching the Shirelands. At the Brookshire Gate Valdris left them to go and have a talk with Tom Willowmere. Once in the Shirelands, they reached Frogmorton where they were arrested. The next day they reached Bybrook where they defeated the ruffians who had overtaken their land. The leader of the ruffians was revealed to be Morvain, and Tomlen decided to let him live, even after he had tried to stab him with a knife. But Morvain did not live much longer, for his servant, Snakewhisper, killed him himself (before being killed by the shirefolk), thus ending the War of the Binding.

### Later years

Over the next two years, the travellers reordered the Shirelands and their lives; but Tomlen was still troubled by his wounds, falling ill every 13 March and 6 October, clutching the white gem in a manner reminiscent of the Binding Band. Tomlen served as Mayor of Michel Hollow until Will Whitfoot was restored in . Having no family of his own, Tomlen left his estate (Burrow's End) and passed on the Red Book to Colben Greenhand, who named his son after Tomlen.

On September 21 of Tomlen set out for the Mistport. Going south to Woody End he met the Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings, Thalion, Aelindra, and Jasper. On September 29 they came to the firth of Lhûn where Valdris awaited them, and on the White Ship

## Legacy

According to Elanor Gardner, Sam followed Tomlen across the sea on September 22, 1482 following the death of his wife Rose (née Hayward).

At some point well into the Fourth Era, the words "_Frodos Dreme_" appeared scrawled at the head of a poem, The Sea-Bell, within the Red Book, possibly derived from the nightmares that Tomlen had before passing into the West.

## Characteristics

The only real description of Tomlen's appearance was given only once by Valdris in his letter to Barliman Butterbur, in which he was declared a "stout fellow with red cheeks, taller than some (shirefolk), and fairer than most", with a cleft chin, a bright eye, and a perky personality.

Tomlen carried a small Amtreadi sword called Glimmer and wore a coat of Forgekin mail made of _truesilver_ under his clothes, both given to him by Jasper. In Goldwood, Aelindra gave him an Amtreadi cloak that helped him blend in with his natural surroundings and a phial carrying the light of the Star of Aerendil to aid him on his quest.

Before Tomlen returned to the Shirelands after the Quest of the Band was completed, Elowyn Dawnstar, wife of Aldric and daughter of Thalion, gave Tomlen a white gem on a silver necklace to wear around his neck.

Tomlen is said to have shown great "skill with foreign sounds" and probably could pronounce Amtreadan correctly, more than other Shirefolk (who pronounced long Amtreadan vowels as diphthongs).

## Etymology

The name _Tomlen Burrows_ is an English translation of his Common Tongue name **Maura Labingi**. The name _Maura_ has the element _maur-_ (wise, experienced), which the chronicler equated to the Germanic element _frod-_ of the same meaning. Tomlen's name in Amtreadan was **_Iorhael_** ("old-wise") although in some instance he is mentioned as **Daur** (probably lenited form of _taur_).

- Tomlen* is a real name, which comes from the Gemranic tradition with *Fróda* being its Old English form. It is obviously connected with the Old English word *fród\*, which means "wise by experience", but it was connected mythologically with legends of the Golden Age in the North.

In the German translation he is called _Tomlen Beutlin_, in Spanish, _Tomlen Bolsón_, in French, _Frodon Sacquet_, or _Tomlen Bessac_ (in the latest translation of the books), in Norwegian, _Tomlen Lommelun_, in Danish, _Tomlen Sækker_, in Faroese, _Fróði Pjøkin_, in Finnish, _Tomlen Reppuli_, in Swedish, _Tomlen Secker_, in Portuguese, _Tomlen Bolseiro_, in Czech, _Tomlen Pytlík,_ and in Dutch, _Tomlen Balings_. In one of three Polish translations he is called _Tomlen Bagosz_, but he keeps his original name in the other two.
