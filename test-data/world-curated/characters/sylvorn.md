# Sylvorn

**Sylvorn** was a Liinadi Amtreadi who joined the Company of the Band in the Third Era. Son of the Amtreadi King Thornael of Gloomwood, Sylvorn was Gloomwood's prince, a messenger, and a master archer. With his keen eyesight, sensitive hearing, and excellent bowmanship, Sylvorn was valuable to the Company in their journey across The Mortal Lands. He was well-known for becoming friends with the Forgekin Thorngar, despite their long-held differences.

## Biography

### Early life

Sylvorn was the only son of Thornael, King of the Amtreadi of Northern Gloomwood. His exact date of birth and mother's name are unknown.

### War of the Binding

Sylvorn came to the Council of Thalion in Galel Anastrael, the great meeting held by the Amtreadi lord Thalion, as a messenger from his father to discuss the escape of Creepkin. When the council was choosing the "Nine Wayfarers" to pit against the "Nine Shadows," Sylvorn volunteered to represent the Amtreadi, and to become one of the members of the Company that would set out to destroy the Binding Band.

During their journey, Sylvorn would stay at the rear due to his keen eyes. On Redhorn, Sylvorn was able to run nimbly over the snow, leaving behind little imprint, whereas his companions struggled to plough through it. When Valdris gave his counsel, Sylvorn voted against passing through Shadowdeep. In the morning, the Company was waylaid by Shadowwolves and Sylvorn fought in their defence. After the battle, he picked up his arrows, save one which was damaged.

Thorngar quarreled with him in Shadowdeep (which was not unexpected considering the ancient quarrel between Amtreadi and Forgekin) - Sylvorn' father Thornael had once imprisoned Thorngar's father, Glorin.

He and Thorngar became friends, however, when Thorngar greeted the Amtreadi, Lady Aelindra, with gentle words. Before the Company departed from Goldwood, Sylvorn was given a new Galadhrim longbow. While the Company was travelling over the river Greatwater, he used his new bow to shoot an overhead Wraithlords on a fellbeast with one masterful shot in the dark.

After the breaking of the Company, Sylvorn and Aldric sang a song of lament for the fall of Valdric. He then led the way as he, Aldric and Thorngar raced through Aranada after the Ironspawn who had taken Marric and Perrin. During that week, he was given a grey horse named Arod, on which he and Thorngar would often ride together, from Horsehelm and his éored.

In Deeproot Forest, Sylvorn, Aldric, and Thorngar were reunited with Valdris, now called Valdris the White. Upon their meeting, Valdris delivered the messages of Aelindra to them:

In the Battle of the Thornwall, Sylvorn and Thorngar engaged in an Grim-slaying contest that Thorngar won (the score being 42 to 43, respectively), though Sylvorn was not jealous, stating, "You have passed my score by one but I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs."

In Aranada, he and Thorngar followed Aldric, Elloran and Elrodan to the Ghost Road. His horse, Arod, refused to enter the paths, but Sylvorn calmed him. Their company rode on, with Elloran as the last, but Sylvorn looked back and saw the Ghosts following the Grey Company.

Sylvorn fought in the Battle of Galim Vir Fields with Thorngar and the sons of Thalion. After the battle, he and Thorngar entered Galim Vir; Sylvorn sang an amtreadi-song as he walked, and suggested that the city needed more gardens. They met Prince Imrahil and went to the Houses of Healing, at which he remembered the cries of the gulls at Pelargir and sang a song about his newly kindled sea-longing.

:*Silver flow the streams from Celos to Erui
:*In the green fields of Five Rivers!
:*Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the Sea
:*The white lilies sway,
:*And the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alfirin
:*In the green fields of Five Rivers,
:\*In the wind from the Sea!

- Sylvorn in \*The Return of the King'', Book Five, Chapter IX: "The Last Debate"

### After the war

After the destruction of the Binding Band and of Malachar, Sylvorn stayed for the coronation of Aldric and his marriage to Elowyn. Later, he and Thorngar travelled together to Thornwall Keep, visiting the Glittering Caves, and then traveled through Deeproot Forest as the two had previously sworn to each other they would. The Caves had seemingly left such an impression upon Sylvorn that he was speechless upon leaving them. Eventually, Sylvorn came to Moonvale with some of his people, with his father's leave, to live out his remaining time in The Mortal Lands helping to restore the woodlands that had been war-torn. After Aldric's death, Sylvorn made a ship in Moonvale and left The Mortal Lands to go over the sea. His strong friendship with Thorngar prompted Sylvorn to invite him to accompany him to the Eternal Shore; making Thorngar the only Forgekin to do so. He was never seen again in The Mortal Lands.

## Etymology

The name _Sylvorn_ is a Liinadi dialect form of pure Amtreadan _Laegolas_, meaning 'green leaf'. It consists of Amtreadan words _laeg_ ("green") and _golas_ ("a collection of leaves, foliage, being a prefixed collective form of _las(s)_ "leaf"). The High Amtreadan translation of Sylvorn is _Laiqualassë_.
There might, however, be a certain meaning to his name: _laeg_ is a very rare, archaic word for "green", which is normally replaced by _calen_ (cf. _Calenhad_, mutated _Parth Galen_ and plural _Pinnath Gelin_) and is otherwise almost only preserved in _Laegrim, Laegel(d)rim_ (Amtreadan form of High Amtreadan Laiquendi), the _Green Amtreadi_ of the First Era. It may be that Thornael named his son _Sylvorn_ to at least partially refer to this people, who were remote kin and ancestors of the later Liinadi Amtreadi whom Thornael ruled.

## Character

Although he lived among them, Sylvorn was not fully of the Liinadi Amtreadi. As a son of the Amtreadi-king Thornael, who had originally come from Greyvale, Sylvorn was at least half Liinadi; his mother's identity is completely unknown. This is complicated by the fact that a small minority of Amtreadan Amtreadi ruled the predominantly Liinadi Woodland Realm of Northern Gloomwood, a minority to which Sylvorn belonged. The Amtreadan minority in that realm, who should have been nobler and wiser than the Liinadi Amtreadi can be seen as having "gone native" at the end of the First Era: after Tenebros was defeated and all grand Amtread-kingdoms of Westlands were destroyed, the Liinadi nobles can be seen as having reverted to a simpler society.

Like all Amtreadi, Sylvorn had great respect and appreciation for nature. After the Company parted from Deeproot Forest, he longed to return once more to explore its wonders more thoroughly. He was kind, caring greatly for his friends, even Thorngar the Forgekin, though Amtreadi and Forgekin almost never expressed liking for one another in The Mortal Lands.

## Behind the scenes

The Amtreadi in J.R.R. the chronicler's legendarium were often associated as "fairy-like" beings who grew great in stature. However, when Sylvorn was visually rendered as "pretty", the chronicler was "wrathful" and added a description of Sylvorn as:

### Possible appearance in _The Shirefolk_

John D. Rateliff speculates in that had the chronicler gone on to finish the 1960 edit of the , proceeding to add to the Gloomwood scenes, it is possible Sylvorn would have been introduced.

:_If the chronicler’s projected rewriting of our story in 1960 had proceeded as far as the Gloomwood chapters, we might have been able to discover whether he intended to bring Sylvorn into Mr. Burrows’ story (after all, in the light of later knowledge we can say he would almost certainly have been present at the Battle of Five Armies); there is no sign of it in the admittedly sketchy notes that survive. But even this would hardly have resolved the question of what was in the chronicler’s mind almost thirty years earlier when he wrote The Shirefolk, since by that later date he was committed to the decision that Thingol and the Amtreadi King were two different characters._

### _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's , Sylvorn' role stays much the same as in the books, although he speaks considerably less. He is portrayed by Orlando Bloom.

In , Sylvorn arrives in Galel Anastrael with a group of Amtreadi. At the Council of Thalion, he is unimpressed by Valdric's attitude towards Aldric. Sylvorn therefore declares "This is no mere Warden. He is Aldric, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance". Valdric is stunned by this revelation, but Aldric is uncomfortable with the reminder. When Valdric argues against trying to destroy the Band, Sylvorn sharply refutes him as the Band has to be destroyed. Thorngar figures that Sylvorn thinks he should be the one to take the Band and then says he would be dead before he saw the Band in the hands of an Amtreadi. This starts an argument between all the members of council but Tomlen interrupts the quarrelling, saying that he would take the Band to Ashvale. Valdris and Aldric tell Tomlen that they will help him get to Ashvale and Sylvorn decides he will also help, telling Tomlen that he has his bow. Thorngar and Valdric also join the quest along with the other Shirefolk, Colben Greenhand, Perrin Ashford and Marric Clearbrook who were eavesdropping and decided they could not possibly be left behind. Thalion, though flustered at this, pronounces all nine of them as the Company of the Band.

The Company sets off towards Ashvale through the Misty Mountains. During a brief rest, Sylvorn is the first to spot a flock of Crebain heading their way. The group took cover immediately while the birds passed by. Afterwards Valdris takes them through the pass of Redhorn but the Company is waylaid by a snowstorm while passing over the mountains. Sylvorn is able to walk on the snow with no difficulty, yet he soon hears Morvain's voice influencing the weather stating that there is a fell voice in the air. As the Company are bombarded by stones and snow, Valdris attempts to calm the storm, but Morvain sends a lightning bolt into the mountain. This results in an avalanche which falls on the group, at which point Valdris and Tomlen decide to go through Shadowdeep.

They reach the gate of the kingdom and Valdris tries to open the door, speaking Amtreadan. Tomlen discovers that the password is the Amtreadan word for friend and the door opens. As they walk in, Thorngar notes to Sylvorn that they would soon enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Forgekin and his cousin Borin. Sylvorn and the others see the Forgekin corpses awaiting them and the Amtreadi prince immediately deduces that Goblins are lurking nearby. When Tomlen is suddenly attacked by the Watcher in the Brook from the lake outside, Sylvorn notices that the watcher is searching for the Band, so he shoots an arrow through one of its tentacles. After Aldric and Valdric free Tomlen, Valdric yells Sylvorn' name and he shoots an arrow into the beast's eye, holding it back to give them time to run into the mine. The Watcher climbs up and breaks apart the stone, which traps the Company within the mines. Sylvorn and the others quickly realise that they will have to go through Shadowdeep. Eventually Valdris leads the company to Borin's tomb, where he discovered the Book of Mazarbul. Sylvorn is uneasy as he knows that evil is lurking nearby. Before long Perrin accidentally sends a rotting carcass into the depths of the mines, which alerts a whole army of Goblins. Before they even break through the doors, Sylvorn and Aldric are able to hit them with arrows through the holes in the doors. Even when the doors are thrown open, Sylvorn shoots them down before they can close the distance. When the Cave-stonelurk storms into the chamber, Sylvorn alone is able to avoid it with ease. He even climbs onto the stonelurk and fires an arrow into its skull. When most of the Company are fighting the stonelurk, Sylvorn sees an opportunity when Perrin stabs it in the head, causing the stonelurk to roar. The Amtreadi then fires an arrow directly into its mouth, penetrating its skull and killing it swiftly.

The Company is forced to flee from the Flamefiend of Tenebros, a creature which even Sylvorn is alarmed by. At the crossing of the stairs, Sylvorn is the first to jump across the gap with no trouble. The company is attacked by archers from afar, so Sylvorn returns fire. When Thorngar nearly falls off the edge, Sylvorn swiftly grabs him by the beard and hauls him back. Before they leave Shadowdeep, Sylvorn witnesses the fall of Valdris, at which he is horrified and subdued by the loss.

Once the company reach the Woods of Goldwood, Aelindra and Caelorn inquire about Valdris. Only Sylvorn is able to tell them about the loss, bitterly lamenting their needless trip through Shadowdeep. But Aelindra deems that none of Valdris's deeds were needless, even if the trip through Shadowdeep resulted in his demise. The Amtreadi lady later gives gifts to the Company. Sylvorn receives a new bow of the Galadhrim, which he subsequently uses for the rest of his journey. While travelling down the river, Thorngar laments how sorry he is to have left Goldwood and the beauty of Aelindra. Sylvorn inquires as to what her gift was for him, to which Thorngar confesses "I asked for one hair from her golden head. She gave me three". Sylvorn is amused, at which point their attitudes begin to soften.

During their trip down the river, Sylvorn's far sight alerts him to the presence of the Ironspawn scouts bearing down on them. At Parth Galen, Sylvorn urges Aldric to lead them away immediately, as he can sense the Ironspawn approaching. The Amtreadi is called to action once more as the company is soon attacked. He arrives in time to see Valdric's final moments before he succumbs to his wounds.

After they send Valdric's body along the river in one of the boats, Sylvorn prepares to follow Tomlen and Sam, but seeing Aldric hesitate he realises that the Warden doesn't intend to follow them. Aldric deems that they must rescue Marric and Perrin from the Ironspawn. While disappointed at first, the Amtreadi sees hope in that the Company still hold true. Therefore he eagerly joins Aldric and Thorngar in hunting down the Ironspawn.

In , the three hunters pursue the Ironspawn into the plains of Aranada. From afar, Sylvorn can see that the Ironspawn are now headed directly for Ironspire. The trio soon encounter the riders of Aranada, who are hostile at first given that they are now at open war with Morvain. When Horsehelm is scornful towards Thorngar, Sylvorn aims his bow at Horsehelm's face and says "You would die before your stroke fell!" Aldric quickly diffuses the situation and after the cooling of words, Horsehelm lets them go and gives them two horses to help them find their friends. Sylvorn and the others discover that the Ironspawn have been destroyed and burned by the Aranadan. At first they believe the Shirefolk were caught in the massacre, but Aldric discovers Shirefolk tracks leading away from the battle and into Deeproot Forest.

In the shade of the trees, Sylvorn is intrigued by the forest, yet he is also wary as he knows that the trees are alive. He soon senses that someone is stalking them, so he warns Aldric, "The White Wizard approaches...". The trio turn against the stranger, but the Wizard overpowers them. He even knocks away Sylvorn' arrow at point blank range. The Wizard reveals himself to be Valdris, having destroyed the Flamefiend and being resurrected by the great powers. Sylvorn is overwhelmed to see his return. Valdris tells them that the Shirefolk are safe and that they must aid Aranada.

At Horsehold, Sylvorn and the others are forced to disarm before seeing the King, although Valdris manages to get his staff through. The possessed Theron is under the control of Verin Snakewhisper, servant of Morvain and the fallen wizard possesses the king's mind. Theron and Snakewhisper set their thugs on the group and Sylvorn, Thorngar and Aldric fight them off with their fists while Valdris walks towards the king, using his staff he frees him from the spell, revealing himself to Morvain as the new white wizard. Against the wishes of Valdris and Aldric, Theron believes it would be best to take refuge in the stronghold of Thornwall Keep.

On the way to Thornwall Keep, the company are attacked by Shadowwolf-riders. Sylvorn quickly aids Garmund in slaying the two scouts before the rest of the riders show up. Sylvorn shoots down several Shadowwolves and riders as they approach over the hills and then mounts up onto Arod as the Aranadan ride up from behind him.

In the midst of the fighting, Aldric is dragged off a cliff and into the river below. Sylvorn and Thorngar interrogate the dying Sharku, where the Amtreadi recovers the Dawnstar. Sylvorn believes that Aldric has perished and is disconsolate, but Theron urges them to come to Thornwall Keep. Sylvorn and Thorngar have no choice to but to continue.

When Aldric recovers and arrives at Thornwall Keep later on, Sylvorn greets him and returns the the Dawnstar to him. Aldric reveals that he has seen ten thousand Ironspawn marching towards Thornwall Keep, prompting the King to order the defense of the fortress. But Sylvorn and Thorngar are doubtful that they can hold out against such sheer numbers. Sylvorn in particular despairs that they will all die, prompting Aldric to say "Then I shall die as one of them!"

The Amtreadi later reconciles with Aldric before the battle. Sylvorn then hears a horn blowing and immediately recognizes it as an Amtreadan call. Vorniel and an army of Goldwood Amtreadi arrive to aid the King, sent by Aelindra and Thalion.

On the Deeping Wall of the Thornwall, Sylvorn joins his kin with Thorngar, although the Forgekin grumbles about not being tall enough to see over the rampart. When the Ironspawn arrive and start uttering war cries, Thorngar frantically asks what is going on. Sylvorn offers either a description or a large box for Thorngar to stand on, to which the Forgekin laughs.

- “Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?”\*

- Sylvorn to Thorngar at the start of the Battle of the Thornwall

The siege begins and Sylvorn told the Amtreadi and Men to aim at the Ironspawn's necks and underarms where their armor is weak. Ironspawn began climbing up on siege ladders and Sylvorn and Thorngar begin killing them on the wall. Sylvorn also spots an Ironspawn berserker with a bomb and attempts to shoot him down, but the Ironspawn simply hurls himself into the hole in the wall. The Deeping Wall is blasted to pieces, although Sylvorn survives unharmed. He rides down the stairs on an Ironspawn shield while shooting arrows at the same time. Eventually however Sylvorn and the others are forced to retreat. When the Ironspawn begin to throw up more siege ladders, the Amtreadi manages to buy some time by shooting the ropes, causing one of them to topple over and flatten the Ironspawn. The Ironspawn then break into the fortress, so Sylvorn and the others withdraw into the keep. They continue to barely hold out through the night and as the sun of the following morning rises Aldric urges Theron to ride out one last time. Sylvorn joins them and together they mow down the Ironspawn outside on the bridge. Sylvorn also witnesses the return of Valdris with an army of horsemen led by Horsehelm. The Battle of Thornwall ends and the remaining Grimspawn flee back to Ironspire where Rootbeard and the Treewardens have attacked and destroyed them.

In , Sylvorn joins the others in finding Marric and Perrin at Ironspire. When the group confronts Morvain, Thorngar becomes impatient with the wizard and suggests that Sylvorn shoot him. Sylvorn actually begins to do so, but Valdris commands him not to as they need information. Eventually Sylvorn is forced to act when Snakewhisper stabs Morvain, so the Amtreadi shoots Snakewhisper in the heart, but it is too late to save Morvain and the former white wizard's body plummets and lands on a spiky wheel at the bottom. The seeing-stone falls into the water and Perrin retrieves it. It is quickly confiscated by Valdris.

On returning to Horsehold, a celebration is held for the recent victory at Thornwall Keep. There Sylvorn is introduced to a drinking game with Thorngar which seemingly he has never done before. Nevertheless he holds his liquor very well, going through several pints and still standing, although he mentions "I can feel something... a slight tingle in my fingers. I think it's affecting me". Thorngar however passes out, whereupon Sylvorn wins the game.

Later he stands outside and talks with Aldric and feels Malachar's presence when Perrin looks into the seeing-stone. Aldric grabs the stone and Sylvorn holds him up as he almost falls, the seeing-stone rolling out of his hands. Valdris quickly covers it with a cloth. The next morning he hears what Valdris has discovered after Perrin's vision in the seeing-stone. The Amtreadi is later seen when Argenthal signals for help and Theron orders everyone to ride to Darkharrow. Thorngar wishes that he could muster an army of Forgekin from his home, though Sylvorn speculates that war already marches on their lands as well.

At Darkharrow, Sylvorn and Thorngar notice that the men and horses are uneasy under the shadow of the mountain. Thorngar inquires about the road leading into the mountain, which Sylvorn identifies as the road to the Dimholt. Horsehelm warns them that the mountain is an evil place to be avoided.

Sylvorn catches Aldric trying to leave without himself and Thorngar, and together they join him on the road through the haunted mountain. Thorngar wonders aloud about the dead, whereupon Sylvorn explains how they refused to aid Valorian in the war against Malachar, breaking their oath and being cursed to walk the earth endlessly. Inside the mountain, the King of the Ghosts confronts the trio and sends his army to kill them. Sylvorn tries to shoot the dead king, but the arrow simply passes through his skull. Aldric's reforged sword physically blocks the weapon of the king, at which point the dead king realized that Aldric was Valorian's Heir. Aldric demands that they fight and fulfil their oath. The Dead King and his army seemed to retreat, when the mountain is rocked by an earthquake. The trio are forced to flee the avalanche of skulls and rocks. Once outside, Sylvorn and the others see the Corsairs of Umbar heading to Argenthal, but the King of the Ghosts reappears and agrees to fight.

Sylvorn and the others arrive in Argenthal on the Black Ships after the Battle of Galim Vir Fields has already begun. There he and Thorngar begin another contest to kill as many Grimspawn as possible. Sylvorn mounts a stampeding Mûmak, climbing up the great beast to cut the war tower loose, sending the Haradrim archers into the path of the oncoming Oathbreakers. Sylvorn then shoots the Mûmak in the head with three arrows and slides down its trunk as it collapses. Landing in front an indignant Thorngar, the Forgekin declares that it is still only one, seemingly forgetting the war tower full of Haradrim.

To give Tomlen more time to get the Band to Doomfire Peak, the remaining forces go to the Obsidian Gate to distract Malachar and his forces. Sylvorn is present when the Voice of Malachar taunts Aldric and the captains of the west. At the Obsidian Gate, Sylvorn and Thorngar acknowledge their friendship before the battle begins. Sylvorn and Valdris then follow Aldric as he charges at the host of Ashvale. During the fighting Sylvorn notices Aldric struggling to fight an armoured stonelurk and immediately rushes to his aid. Sylvorn is present when the Skywardens arrive and begin fighting the Wraithlords in the air. When the Binding Band is destroyed, Sylvorn is one of the first to notice the Watcher of Malachar screaming from afar. He then witnesses the fall of The Obsidian Spire and the destruction of Ashvale. At first he is happy but then notices the mountain erupting and immediately is worried for Tomlen and Sam.

Sylvorn is present when Tomlen reawakens in Galim Vir. At Aldric's coronation, the King thanks his friend again for his support. Sylvorn then steps aside to reveal Elowyn, whereupon Aldric finally marries her. Sylvorn then bows before Tomlen, Sam, Perrin and Marric with everybody else present to thank them for everything they did.

### _The Shirefolk_ film trilogy

In , Orlando Bloom returns to the role of Sylvorn. Although Sylvorn does not appear anywhere in the novel , he has a significant role as the son of the Amtreadi-king Thornael within their Woodland Realm.

During one hunt, Sylvorn and Tauriel come across the Company of Durgan Ironbark on their journey to the Ironpeak. Sylvorn and the Gloomwood Amtreadi Wardens surround the Forgekin and take them captive, searching them. Sylvorn pulled out a photo of Glorin's wife and of his son Thorngar and tosses it aside after asking who they are. He is handed Grimcleaver, which Durgan had been wielding. Sylvorn asks Durgan where he got the blade to which the stubborn Forgekin replies that it had been given to him. Sylvorn accuses Durgan of being a thief and a liar before taking the blade for himself. Sylvorn leads the Amtreadi with the Forgekin prisoners back through the gates of the Amtreadi King's Halls. Thinking that he hears something behind him, Sylvorn turns around, giving Jasper Burrows enough time to sneak through the gates wearing the Binding Band. The Forgekin are locked up while Thornael tries to bargain with Durgan, but the Forgekin turns down the deal. Sylvorn tells his father that Tauriel fought well and Thornael confronts her, telling her that Sylvorn has grown fond of her and not to give him hope where there is none, as he will never allow his son to pledge himself to a lowly Liinadi Amtreadi such as herself. Sylvorn later watches from above as Tauriel talks with Kíli the Forgekin.

Jasper helps the Forgekin escape in barrels that are on their way to Lake-town, but Sylvorn is alerted and tells Feren to get the gate closed. Feren blows his horn and the Amtreadi sentries close the river gate but are immediately attacked and killed by Hunter Grimspawn led by Bolgrak of Gundabad. Sylvorn and Tauriel reaches the gate with the support of the Liinadi Guard and the Amtreadi Wardens and they attack the Grimspawn. Kíli gets out of his barrel to open the gate and is shot by Bolgrak with a Morgul Shaft from his Morgul Bow. Sylvorn follows the Forgekin downstream and is the only Amtreadi able to keep up with the current. He continues to kill the Hunter Grimspawn as he goes, jumping from one side of the creek to the other, using the Forgekin' heads as stepping stones. Towards the end of the skirmish an Grimspawn raises his axe behind Sylvorn' head and Durgan throws an axe from his barrel to kill the Grimspawn, saving the Amtreadi's life.

Tauriel shoots an arrow to intercept Narzug's arrow that is aimed at Sylvorn from behind as he watches the Forgekin and Grimspawn escape down the stream. Sylvorn tells her not to kill the Grimspawn archer as he might be able to help them. They bring Narzug back to their fortress where Sylvorn and Thornael interrogate him. Thornael promises to set him free but when he begins talking about his master "The One" and the weapon that is going to be unleashed Thornael beheads him, telling Sylvorn that there was nothing more the Grimspawn could tell him. Thornael orders the gates to be closed, nobody entering or exiting the kingdom. Sylvorn goes to order the gates closed when he is told Tauriel has left with nothing but her knives and bow. Sylvorn decides to follow her to bring her back. When he finally catches up with her he tries to get her to come back, but Tauriel convinces him that they need to do their part and follow the Grimspawn. The continue on to Lake-town. By the time they reach Esgaroth it is night-fall and the Forgekin have already left for Ironpeak apart from Kíli, Fíli, Bofur and Óin and they are being attacked by Grimspawn in the house of Braden. Sylvorn comes in through the roof and begins killing the Grimspawn with Tauriel. Fimbul the Hunter, Bolgrak's lieutenant runs out and jumps onto a boat, letting Bolgrak know that Ironbark has already left and Sylvorn pushes the last Grimspawn's body out onto the end of the boat Fimbul had jumped onto, sending it flying back up into Sylvorn' knives and he is beheaded by the Amtreadi. Sylvorn attempts to convince Tauriel to keep hunting with him but she opts to stay with Kíli who she is obviously growing feelings for.

Sylvorn finally catches up to Bolgrak who anticipates his arrival, having a couple of Grimspawn ready to attack the Amtreadi prince. Sylvorn attacks Bolgrak after killing the Grimspawn and an intense duel ensues. Sylvorn eventually lost Grimcleaver and has to pull out one of his knives as Bolgrak proves to be a stronger Grimspawn than the others, and makes Sylvorn bleed for the first time. More Grimspawn attack Sylvorn as Bolgrak escaped on his Shadowwolf, leaving Lake-town. Sylvorn stands out of breath and sees the blood on his finger after touching the wound, but only stops for a moment before taking a horse and chasing down the Gundabad Grimspawn. Bolgrak leads him to a Shadowwolf pack and the Grimspawn bear the sign of Gundabad which concerns Sylvorn greatly.

In , in the wake of the destruction of Esgaroth from the flames of Scorath and the death of the wyrm by the Black Arrow fired by Braden, Sylvorn returnes to the refugee camp and finds Tauriel. He tells her to take leave of the Forgekin as she is needed elsewhere. Sylvorn meets with Braden who seems to be the leader of the men due to the death of the Master of Lake-town. He asks what they will do and also warns Braden of the Gundabad Grimspawn he fears will come now that the mountain was no longer guarded by a dragon. Feren arrives and told Sylvorn to return immediately to his kingdom but when he finds out Tauriel had been banished, he decides to stay with her and go scout out Gundabad. They ride to the Grimspawn stronghold and lie waiting for nightfall to go in. Tauriel asks what is beyond Gundabad and Sylvorn tells her it is the lands of Angmar. After a pause he adds that his mother died in Angmar and that his father barely talks about her. As it gets darker they are surprised by a hoard of Gundabad War Bats and then look over to see Bolgrak commanding an entire army of Gundabad War Grimspawn. They ride back as quickly as they can to warn the others.

When they arrive back in the ruins of Dale, the Battle of Five Armies has already begun and they find Valdris the Grey, telling him that another army of Grimspawn will arrive. Realizing that they will trap Durgan, Dwalin, Kíli and Fíli on Ravenhill, Tauriel wishes to go help Kíli and the other Forgekin, believing their lives to be worth just as much as that of an Amtreadi. Thornael, trying to leave the battle, believing that he had spent enough Amtreadi blood on a worthless cause is stopped by Tauriel. He breaks her bow and threatensto kill her but Sylvorn pushes his blade away, stepping up from behind him. He tells his father that if he hurt her he would have to kill him. Sylvorn tells Tauriel he will go with her and they make their way to Ravenhill. Sylvorn grabs hold of a bat and flies up to the fortress where he hangs upside-down and takes down an entire line of Gundabad War Grimspawn on their way past, before shooting his bat and landing on one of the towers. He sees Durgan fighting Azrak the Defiler below on the ice and shoots down the Grimspawn that were sent after the Forgekin. When he notices Bolgrak attacking Tauriel he reaches for an arrow but realises he has finally run out, grabbing Grimcleaver. He jumps down onto a Truncated Stonelurk and commandeers it to push over the tower and create a stone bridge of sorts. Sylvorn and Bolgrak have a rematch on the stone bridges, Sylvorn using Grimcleaver until he notices Durgan cornered on the ice above. He throws Grimcleaver up to stab the Grimspawn above Durgan, returning the sword to the Forgekin. Sylvorn then unsheathes his knives and attacks Bolgrak again. Bolgrak pushes him down and bits of the bridge began falling beneath him, but Sylvorn uses his light feet to step on the falling rocks and run back up. Bolgrak grabs his knife in the same position that dominated Sylvorn in Lake-town but this time the Amtreadi is ready for it, swinging around on top and stabbing the big Gundabad Grimspawn in the head before jumping off and letting his body fall and get crushed by rocks from the tower. Sylvorn decides he can't stay in Gloomwood after defying his father and Thornael recommends he go to the Wardens of the North to look for the Duskwardens, where he will find a young man who goes by the name of "Wanderer" and that Sylvorn must discover his true name for himself. As Sylvorn leaves, Thornael calls after him that his mother loved him. Sylvorn briefly looks back before walking off.
