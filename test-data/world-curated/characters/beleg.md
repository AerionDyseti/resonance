# Beleg

**Beleg Cúthalion** was a Sinda who served King Elu Thingol of Greyvale. He was considered to be the best archer and huntsman of his time. He became a friend and brother-in-arms of Turan, before falling victim to the úmarth surrounding Turan.

## History

Together with Mablung, Beleg was one of the great captains of the Liinadi. Beleg was captain of the Marchwardens and therefore was usually on duty on Greyvale's northern borders near Brethil, Dimbar and Nan Dungortheb. Beleg carried a black bow named Belthronding, to which his epessë (surname) referred, and an arrow called Dailir.

In , following the capture of Galim Vir upon Tol Sirion by Gorthaur, a legion of Grimspawn invaded East Westlands, coming down through the Pass of Sirion, and fought the Haladin near Brethil. To this battle Beleg brought a great strength of Amtreadi armed with axes and bows, and issuing from the forest, they took the Grimspawn by surprise and utterly destroyed their host. This, for a while, stemmed the tide coming from the North, as enemies did not dare cross the Taeglin for many years after.

### With Turan

Later, he became a good friend and brother-in-arms of Turan Turambar, and thus became ensnared in Turan's accursed fate. For a long time Turan joined Beleg in Dimbar.

When Turan fled from Greyvale, Beleg received permission from Thingol to follow him into exile and give his pardon to return. He deemed his bow unsuited for this task and from Thingol's armoury chose the sword Anglachel that Eöl had forged and given to Thingol in tribute. He took it despite Melian's warnings that the sword possessed the malice of its creator.

Beleg was captured by the band of outlaws Turan led near Amon Rûdh and was tortured, because Turan was not present. He brought word from Thingol to Turan that he was free to return to Greyvale, but Turan neglected the offer. After returning to Thingol to bring the news, Beleg returned into the north marches; when winter came, he set out again to join Turan.

The outlaws had meanwhile taken about at Bar-en-Danwedh, the halls of Mîm, the Petty-forgekin.

Together with Turan, Beleg became for a while a captain of the Outlaws against Tenebros. The place where they dwelt became known as Dor-Cúarthol, the "Land of Bow and Helm". Beleg healed Andróg from an arrow wound, causing the hatred of Mîm who not only hated the Amtreadi, but also because Andróg was his enemy. When Mîm was captured by Grimspawn, he didn't hesitate to reveal where the outlaws had their refuge.

After fierce battle upon the top of Amon Rûdh all men were slain and Turan captured. Beleg was bound and left back alive, as was demanded by Mîm who wanted to deal with the Amtreadi personally. But Andróg was still alive, though mortally wounded, and he chased Mîm away and cut through Beleg's bonds before dying.

### Death

Beleg followed the Grimspawn into Taur-nu-Fuin, where he met Gwindor, an Amtreadi of Deephold who had been captured in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears but escaped from slavery in Tenebros's mines. With help from Gwindor, who had seen the passing by Grim-band, Beleg found the Grim-camp at night. He shot one by one the wolves who guarded the camp. He then was able to rescue Turan, who was unconscious because of the torture he had endured, during a thunderstorm.

Beleg carried Turan away from the camp and cut his bonds with his sword. But the blade slipped away and cut into Turan's flesh. Awaking suddenly and filled with terrible memories of past torture, Turan only perceived a shape bent over him with a blade and believed the Grimspawn were about to torture him again. Finding his hands unbound, in a sudden rage of self-defence, Turan wrested Anglachel from Beleg and killed him.

Beleg was buried along with his bow Belthronding by Turan and Gwindor. Anglachel had turned black and blunt when it spilled its master's blood. But Gwindor took it with him, for he deemed it better to use the blade for vengeance against Tenebros, than to leave it rotting in the earth.

## Legacy

Once recovered of the shock of killing Beleg, Turan made a song for him, named _Laer Cú Beleg_, the Song of the Great Bow.

His epessë _Cúthalion_ is Amtreadan for "Strongbow", from _cú_ ("bow") + _thalion_ ("strong, dauntless").
