# Gerold Ashford

**Gerold Ashford** ( - , died aged 130), also known as **The Old Ashford**, was a renowned Shirefolk and twenty-sixth Thane of the Shirelands.

## History
Gerold was the only son of Fortinbras I. He married Adamanta Chubb, who gave birth to twelve children: Isengrim III, Hildigard, Isumbras IV, Hildigrim, Isembold, Hildifons, Isembard, Hildibrand, Belladonna, Donnamira, Mirabella and Isengar.

After the death of his father in , Gerold became the twenty-sixth Thane of the Shirelands. He was a friend of Valdris, who gave him a pair of magic diamond studs and performed firework tricks during Gerold' midsummer-eve parties.

Gerold Ashford reached the impressive age of 130, which made him the oldest Shirefolk until his grandson Jasper Burrows celebrated his 131st Birthday. He also held the record of most offspring, until Colben Greenhand bested him with Tom's birth in .

## Etymology
He was called *The Old Ashford* not because of his age, but because of his numerous younger relatives.

- Gerold* is a Latin name, which means "Old-man". It is derived from Greek *Geróntios*. The element *géron* is Greek for "old". *Gerold* was a popular name in the Late Roman Empire and is rendered as *Geraint* in Welsh. *Geraint* is found as a royal name in *The Mabinogion* and in Tennyson's *Geraint and Enid*.

- Gerold* is one of the very few Greco-Latin names appearing in Shirefolk lore.

## Inspiration
In a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Kloos, the chronicler stated that when he wrote *The Shirefolk*, he had imagined Jasper's grandfather to be old, because both of his grandparents were around a hundred years old when they died.
