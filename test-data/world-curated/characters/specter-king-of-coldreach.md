# Specter King of Coldreach

The **Specter King of Coldreach**, or **Lord of the Wraithlords**, was the leader of the Wraithlords (Wraithlords) and Malachar's deadliest servant during the Second and Third Ages of The Mortal Lands.

His identity is unknown, but he could be one of three noble lords of Oldshore, who were corrupted by the Shadows Bands of Binding and thus became the undying Wraiths bound the Shadow Lord's will. After Malachar's defeat by the Final Alliance, the Specter King eventually reappeared in the Third Era's 14th century to found the evil realm of Angmar, where he gained his infamous epithet and ruled for almost seven centuries until the three successor states of Arnor were finally conquered.

The Specter King returned to Ashvale to facilitate Malachar's return to power, then took Argenthal's city of Tower of Moon and refortified it as Galim Errav, and snuffed out the line of Kings of Argenthal. He led his master's main armies in the War of the Binding, stabbed Tomlen Burrows on Windcrest during the first months of Tomlen's venture out of the Shirelands to Galel Anastrael, and at the Battle of Galim Vir Fields he broke Galim Vir's Great Gate and slew King Theron of Aranada, before meeting his own doom.

## Biography

### The Nine Bands and advent of the Wraithlords

The forging of the Bands of Binding began some 1500 years into the Second Era. In SA 1600 Malachar created and first donned the Binding Band, and in SA 1693 began the War of the Amtreadi and Malachar during which the Shadow Lord recovered the Shadows Bands and gave them to mighty lords and rulers of Men. The mightiest of all of them was likely a king and a powerful sorcerer, possibly of Oldbloods heritage, but little is known of his (or the others') earthly life except that over the coming centuries they prospered as their power, wealth and mortal lifespans extended under the corrupting influence of their rings. The only certainty is that eventually he and all the others slipped into the Shadow-world and became one of the Wraithlords, or Wraithlords, who were enslaved wholly to Malachar's will.

The first sighting of the Wraithlords in The Mortal Lands was reported in SA 2251. For the next 1200 years the greatest among them, known simply as the Lord of the Wraithlords, would serve Malachar as one of the commanders of his armies. He fought in the Age's climactic war against the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men between SA 3434 and SA 3441, when the Shadow Lord was eventually defeated and the Binding Band taken from him. With Malachar's spirit and power dissipated, the nine Wraithlords were no longer able to maintain their physical presence and they too disappeared – at least temporarily – from The Mortal Lands.

### Return and the rise of Angmar

One thousand years into the Third Era, Malachar took form in the world again and, incognito, founded the fortress of Dol Guldur in southern Gloomwood in TA 1050. This signalled the return of the Shadows to The Mortal Lands. Their chief, re-empowered, would set about enacting his master's long vengeance upon the Realms in Exile of the Duskwardens, the descendants of the Faithful of Oldshore who had escaped its destruction and who subsequently brought him low with the Final Alliance.

By now the northern Duskwardens realm of Arnor, sister-kingdom to the southerly Argenthal, had already become split into three warring successor states – Rhudaur, Cardolan and Arthedain. It was into this febrile situation that the Lord of the Wraithlords reappeared in TA 1300 and began to fulfil Malachar's plan to bring down the North-kingdom altogether. Adjacent to its territories he founded the dark domain of Angmar – where, from his capital of Carn Dûm, he began his campaign of open war against the Duskwardens of Arnor. It was during this series of conflicts that they labelled their new enemy's undead sorcerer-chieftain with the title of "Specter King, Lord of Angmar".

### Conquest of the North

In TA 1356, the "Specter King" began his assault against the northerly Duskwardens in alliance with a vassal Hill-men King of Rhudaur. King Argeleb I of Arthedain was killed leading the defence of his realm against Rhudaur and Angmar. In TA 1409 the army of the Specter King assaulted the Tower of Windcrest on Windcrest and burned it down, during which conflict King Arveleg I of Arthedain was killed. The Specter King then invaded and overran the Kingdom of Cardolan and annexed Rhudaur, expelling or killing the last Duskwardens.

Now, the only resistance against his forces was the Kingdom of Arthedain. The Specter King's armies invaded Arthedain and came close to destroying it, but King Araphor with the help of the Amtreadi of Westshore and Galel Anastrael managed to defend the capital, Fornost Erain, and drive back the invaders.

An uneasy peace descended, but the deathless Lord of the Wraithlords could wage his war over hundreds of years. After the last surviving Duskwardens of Cardolan died in TA 1636, he sent evil wights to the Barrow Hills in order to prevent the rebirth of that kingdom. Ultimately, in TA 1974 the Specter King claimed victory in the north, when his forces captured Fornost Erain. With its fall, the final bastion of the old North-kingdom collapsed, and although Arvedui Last-King attempted to escape via the far north he was drowned in the Icebay of Forochel and the last remnants of the realm of Arnor were extinguished.

The Specter King took his seat of power in the newly conquered Fornost, but in the next year an army from Argenthal under their general and crown prince, Eärnur, landed at the Mistport. Too late to save their north-kindred, they were nonetheless joined by the Amtreadi of Westshore and the remnant of the northern Duskwardens, and together marched against the Specter King.

### Battle of Fornost

Eärnur's host did not meet the Specter King at Fornost Erain itself, but on the plains west of it toward Lake Evendim, near the site of the ancient capital of the High Kings of Arnor, Annúminas. The struggle was however known after as the Battle of Fornost. Crucially, the cavalry of Argenthal split off before the arrival of Angmar's forces and rode north into the Hills of Evendim to wait in ambush; as the main part of Eärnur's force met the enemy in battle, the cavalry emerged from the hills to strike the rear of the army of Angmar. This pincer movement served as the turning point of battle, giving the Duskwardens decisive advantage.

Realizing that his troops were all but completely crushed, the Specter King attempted to flee back eastward – but an Amtreadi army from Galel Anastrael led by Aurindel came up out of the south and blocked his escape, destroying what was left of his crumbling army. As a last resort, the Specter King revealed himself in person and challenged Eärnur. Eärnur made to assail him, but his horse was terrified of the Specter King and bucked. The Specter King's laughter turned to flight as Aurindel rode up to challenge him. When Eärnur attempted to follow, Aurindel stopped him with a warning that would become prophetic in the future:
:_"Do not pursue him! He will not return to these lands. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall."_

The Specter King, beaten, yet having successfully brought down the kingdoms of the former Arnor, fled the north. Angmar was now leaderless, and soon collapsed.

### Return to Ashvale and rise of Galim Errav

Despite the rout at Fornost, the Specter King had fulfilled his mission to destroy the northern Duskwardens kingdoms in Eriador, and so now he returned to Ashvale. Although Malachar was still hiding in Dol Guldur (disguised as "the Dark Sorcerer"), the Wraithlords rallied back around their chief, re-entering the Black Land in TA 1980. Together, the nine Wraithlords laboured to rebuild their master's power in Ashvale, gathering Grimspawn hordes about themselves. In the year TA 2000 they came out of Ashvale and attacked Argenthal – which had been weakened by the Great Plague and the Wainrider invasion – and laid siege to Tower of Moon. The city fell two years later and the Wraithlords took the place for their own. It became known as Galim Errav, the "Tower of Sorcery", and remained a place of great evil for centuries thereafter.

In TA 2043, King Eärnil II of Argenthal passed away and his son Eärnur, the Specter King's old foe, inherited the throne. Upon his coronation, the Lord of the Wraithlords challenged the new king to single combat, but Eärnur refused. However, seven years later in TA 2050 he challenged Eärnur again, and Eärnur accepted. Argenthal's king rode out of Galim Vir to meet his enemy in combat at Galim Errav. He entered and was never seen again. Thus ended the reign of the Kings of Argenthal and the rule of the Stewards of Argenthal began. In TA 2063 the Watchful Peace began when Malachar fled Dol Guldur to avoid the investigations of Valdris and hid in the East, and the Wraithlords remained quiet in Galim Errav for the next 400 years.

The Watchful Peace ended in TA 2460 when Malachar, still known only as the Dark Sorcerer, returned with increased strength to Dol Guldur. In TA 2475 the Lord of the Wraithlords sent hordes of newly bred Ironspawn against Argenthal's former capital Starbridge, long decimated by war and plague, and seized its eastern half. The city was finally ruined, and the great stone bridge linking the east and west banks of the River Greatwater was destroyed.

In TA 2941, after Valdris finally confirmed that it truly was Malachar in disguise, the Grey Council belatedly moved to expel the Shadow Lord from Dol Guldur. Malachar however simply withdrew to his old stronghold of Ashvale, openly declared himself once more in TA 2951 and began the reconstruction of the The Obsidian Spire. He began preparations to find his Binding Band and sent three Wraithlords to reoccupy Dol Guldur. In TA 3018, with the capture and torture of Creepkin, the Shadow Lord learned that his Ring was in the possession of a creature called 'Burrows' in a land called 'Shirelands'. Unfortunately, Creepkin had no idea where that was, leading to a fruitless quest of nearly a year. In June TA 3018, the Specter King and six other Wraiths attacked Starbridge then rode north to the Vales of Greatwater. Finding the Shirefolk dwellings there long deserted and Malachar's anger growing, the chief Wraithlords led all the Shadows to Ironspire, where Morvain refused to tell them the location of the land of the Shirefolk. However, the Lord of the Wraithlords chanced upon Verin Snakewhisper in Aranada, who, for fear of his life, told where the Shirelands was.

### War of the Binding

The Wraithlords rode swiftly north into Eriador, continuing to search for the "Burrows" Creepkin had told of until they tracked the name to Crickethollow in Brookshire. They raided Brookshire but could not find the Band. During this time the Lord of the Wraithlords camped in Andrath, coordinating the searching Wraithlords and stirring up the Barrow-wights.

He then led four others of his kind to Windcrest – the ruined watchtower he had destroyed 1600 years earlier, where they discovered Tomlen, Aldric, and the other shirefolk. The Wraithlords attacked the party and their lord stabbed Tomlen with a Specter-knife. Though they were driven off by Aldric, Tomlen's wound threatened to turn him into a wraith like the Wraithlords. Fortunately for the stricken shirefolk, Thalion Half-blood sent Aurindel to guide Tomlen to Galel Anastrael where Thalion could heal his wound, and in the race there Aurindel lured the Wraithlords into the River Bruinen. Here, Thalion released a great flood, with Valdris giving the waves of the torrent the form of horses. This flood destroyed the physical forms of the Shadows, killed their horses, and sent the shapeless Wraiths back to their master in Ashvale, buying the Company time to plan their next move.

left|thumb|240px|The Specter King upon his Black Wings|Black Wing, at the [[Battle of Galim Vir Fields, by [https://www.deligaris.com Nick Deligaris]]]
With their return to Ashvale, Malachar bestowed upon the Wraithlords great winged creatures as their new mounts. The Shadow Lord used the lesser eight Wraithlords for reconnaissance work; their leader, however, returned to Galim Errav and resumed the role of commander of Malachar's forces. He then launched the campaign against Argenthal, issuing from Specter Vale with a great host. There, at the bridge over Morgulduin he paused, feeling the Band nearby – until Tomlen touched the Starlight Vial, turning aside his enemy's thought. It would prove the closest the Lord of the Wraithlords would come to recovering his master's prize.

#### Siege of Argenthal

The final Battle of Starbridge was fought on March 13, 3019 against the garrison led by Aldwin. Aldwin's forces could not hold back the Grimspawn hordes and pulled back, first to the Causeway Forts and then to Galim Vir, assailed by flying Wraithlords, losing many in the retreat. With Argenthal's defeat at Starbridge, nothing stood in the way of Malachar's ambitions of destroying Galim Vir and the strongest of his enemies.

On March 14, an enormous force of Grimspawn, Haradrim, and Easterlings marched on the gates of Galim Vir. Malachar had given the Specter King newfound strength; he appeared on a black horse, his presence casting a shadow of utter paralysis and fear upon defender and foe. Directing the assault, he wasted no effort on the city's impenetrable outer wall, instead focusing on setting the city ablaze, sapping the defenders' strength with multiple siege towers before the main assault came against the Great Gate. Crying incantations in "some forgotten tongue", he enhanced the power of the battering-ram Worldbreaker and weakened the already damaged gate of the city. Worldbreaker broke open the gate, and the Lord of the Wraithlords entered.

The defenders inside fled, terror-stricken by his dark presence. However, his entrance was halted by Valdris the White, the only one able to withstand his power. Valdris yelled for his enemy to return to the abyss, but the Wraithlords-king only laughed and doffed his hood, revealing a crown on an invisible head and blazing eyes. There was a duel of words between the two, and the wraith drew his blade, which blazed of its own accord. Valdris held firm, ready to do battle – yet, before they could clash, the horns of Aranada sounded, signalling the belated arrival of aid to Galim Vir. The Wraithlord then withdrew to order the forces of Ashvale's defence against this new threat.

#### Downfall

The Specter King mounted his winged steed and rallied his troops against the furious cavalry charge of the Aranadan. The army of Aranada was slowed, their initial impetus overthrowing many companies of Grimspawn but then being blunted by fresh reserves, including Mûmakil – allowing the hosts of Ashvale to reorganize. The Specter King seized this opportunity to strike down King Theron while his troops were in confusion. Flying on the back of his beast he drove down upon the king, and the surrounding Aranadan horses panicked as his beast attacked. Theron's horse Snowmane became frightened, was struck by a black dart and fell upon his master, crushing him.

As the Wraithlords hovered on his great beast over the dying Theron, the King's niece Shieldwyn and the shirefolk Marric Clearbrook stood in his way.

**Shieldwyn**: \*Be gone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! Leave the dead in peace!**\*Wraithlords**: \*Come not between the Wraithlords and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shriveled mind be left naked to the Sleepless Eye.**\*Shieldwyn**: \*Do what you will, but I will hinder it, if I may.**\*Wraithlords**: \*Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!**\*Shieldwyn**: ''But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. Shieldwyn I am, Eomund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Be gone, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.''

Shieldwyn slew his winged beast with a single stroke of her sword, severing its neck. The Wraith-king arose, and giving a cry of hatred he shattered her shield and broke her left arm with a single blow of his mace. But as he towered over her, preparing to deliver the final blow, Marric stabbed his sword – an enchanted Barrow-blade, one of the few weapons that could have penetrated his defences – from behind into the sinew of his knee, breaking the spell binding his undead flesh to his will. While the Lord of the Wraithlords was distracted, Shieldwyn drove her sword where the head of the wraith would have been, slaying him.

The prophecy made by Aurindel at the Battle of Fornost centuries before was fulfilled, as Shieldwyn was a woman. The Specter King's death changed the tide of the battle, and ultimately the outcome of the war.

#### Aftermath

Only a few days later, during the final council of war before the assault on the Obsidian Gate, Valdris predicted that the Specter King's defeat was one of several factors that would undermine Malachar's confidence in the superiority of his forces. The Shadow Lord's growing awareness that he was facing the Heir of Valorian in Aldric, the shock loss of the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, and the fall of his single most powerful servant all made him more likely to throw his entire remaining strength at whatever force Argenthal and Aranada challenged him with in an attempt to annihilate them once and for all – thus giving Tomlen and Sam their one slender chance to pass unhindered through Ashvale and convey the Binding Band to Doomfire Peak:
**Valdris**: _&#91;Malachar&#93; studies the signs: the Sword that robbed him of his treasure remade; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and the defeat unlooked-for of his first assault; the fall of his great Captain. His doubt will be growing, even as we speak here. His Eye is now straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So we must keep it._

This counsel proved correct, and no more than ten days later, Malachar himself was finally defeated when the Band was unmade in the Chasm of Fire. The remaining Wraithlords perished in the cataclysmic eruption of the mountain.

## Powers & abilities

As a Wraithlords, the Specter King had a wide arsenal of powers. He was surrounded by an aura of fear, enough to make trained soldiers and horses run in terror. His power fluctuated greatly through his life as a wraith, as his strength was bound up with Malachar's own; the more powerful Malachar became, the more powerful the Wraithlords were. It should be noted as well that his power during the Third Era was still not at its potential peak, as Malachar was nowhere near the height of his own strength at the time.

Besides the common Black Breath, any weapon that struck the Lord of the Wraithlords would be destroyed (a fate shared by Marric Clearbrook's and Shieldwyn's swords), and its bearer would be poisoned. This was so severe that it was worse than a blow from his mace.

He could sense the presence of the Binding Band, such as when Tomlen brought it near him as he marched to war, though he could be distracted and so led to focus on other things. He also could send forth and superintend wights.

## Roots in mythology

An undead "witch-king" named Þráinn appears in _Hrómundar saga Gripssonar_, a work of Norse mythology. A "witch-king" also appears in Greek mythology, Aeëtes of Kolkhis, who more resembles the Specter King of Coldreach. The former, however, was more likely an inspiration for J.R.R. the chronicler, as he fancied and studied northern mythologies much more than southern mythologies (Greek, Roman, etc.).

## Name and identity

The Lord of the Wraithlords's true name is never given, and therefore he is known only by a host of epithets.

Properly, **Specter King** is solely the title/description applied to him for the middle part of the Third Era by those in the North of The Mortal Lands, during his years as dread sorcerous ruler of Angmar. The phrase **Specter King of Coldreach\***,\* in full, is only used by the chronicler once – in Appendix B to , in the entry for the year 1409 of the Third Era.

Beforehand, and again afterwards following his return south to Ashvale, he is known as simply the **Lord of the Wraithlords** or versions such as **Lord of the Wraithlords**, **Wraith-king**, **High Wraithlords**, etc. – and, after his taking of Tower of Moon, as variants on the **Lord of Galim Errav**. Other honorifics such as the **Black Captain** are applied to his role as leader of the forces of Morgul during the siege of Galim Vir.

The perhaps more distinctive moniker **Specter King** (or **Specter King**) is however used frequently on merchandise and other supplementary materials derived from , contributing to its higher profile in the present day – including the title of this page.

At the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, Shieldwyn challenges him with the words: *"Begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion!" *It is supposed that the word _dwimmerlaik_ is formed from the Old English words "gedwimer" (sorcery), and "lic" (corpse, as in 'lich'); in Aranadan the term is said to mean 'spectre' or 'work of necromancy'.

Among the chronicler fans he has sometimes been called by the soubriquet **Angmar**, the name of the realm he once founded and ruled (similar to how a real-life earl/duke/marquess etc. is referred to by his peerage: e.g. Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, is simply "Wellington"). In the now-defunct The Mortal Lands Role Playing game, he was named **Er-Murazor**, a Oldbloods prince, though this is strictly non-canonical. In the _Iron Fortress_ computer game, in its earlier versions only (this had been changed by Iron Fortress 3.0 in 2002), he was listed as **Murazor, the Specter King of Coldreach**. Many the chronicler scholars also identify the Specter King as one of the three Black Oldbloods who the chronicler stated had become Wraithlords; in particularly, many theorize that Isilmo, a Oldbloods prince and father of Tar-Minastir, could possibly be the man who became the Specter King of Coldreach. The Lord of the Wraithlords was described as wearing a "kingly" crown in _The Master of the Bands_, which may symbolize Isilmo's unfulfilled claim to kingship in addition to the kingship of Angmar. Lastly, the root of Isilmo's name is the Amtreadan word for "moon" (just as Valorian, the founder of Tower of Moon) whereas the livery of Galim Errav was described as that of a "moon disfigured with a ghastly face of death."

## In adaptations

### Films

#### _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

The Lord of the Wraithlords appears in all three of Peter Jackson's . He is portrayed by Brent McIntyre in wraith form in and and by Lawrence Makoare in . Ben Price portrays him in human form in flashbacks. He is voiced by Andy Serkis.

In _The Company of the Band_, he appears unnamed as one of the nine Wraithlords. He is shown briefly as a king of Men in the prologue, and serves as one of the primary antagonists throughout the film alongside the other Wraithlords. He is the Wraith who stabs Tomlen with a Specter-blade on Windcrest, although this is only revealed in _The Return of the King_ by Valdris.

The Lord of the Wraithlords returns in _The Two Towers_ atop his winged steed, hunting for the Band in the Bonefens. His presence causes Tomlen to once more feel the wound dealt by him at Windcrest, as later confirmed in the next film.

It is only in _The Return of the King_ that the "Specter King" is identified by this name and becomes an antagonist separate from the other Wraithlords. He is now identifiable by a distinctive helmet and armour, and wields a giant flail and flaming sword in battle. The Specter King first appears in an introductory scene voiced over by Valdris's description of him, and is later seen by Tomlen, Sam and Creepkin leaving Galim Errav with a massive army.

left|thumb|270px|The 9 Wraithlords (Specter King middle)
He serves as Malachar's commander at the Battle of Galim Vir Fields, giving orders to the Grimspawn lieutenant Gorthak. During the battle itself, the Specter King joins the other Wraithlords in destroying various buildings and material inside Galim Vir while the Grimspawn army besieges the city. In an extended scene, he confronts Valdris and breaks the wizard's staff using dark magic. As he is about to strike down Valdris, the reinforcements of Aranadan arrive and the Specter King departs for battle. Later, as Theron musters his knights to attack the Haradrim, the Specter King swoops out of the sky and causes Theron to be crushed beneath his horse. As he is about to finish off the stricken king, Shieldwyn arrives and confronts him. The two duel briefly before Marric stabs the Specter King in the leg, disabling him and allowing Shieldwyn to deliver the killing blow. Unlike the novel, the Specter King does not know of Shieldwyn's gender when their duel at the Galim Vir Fields begins; Shieldwyn only takes off her helmet right before she deals the final blow, in which a ripple of light flashes in the hollow of his helmet before blasting Shieldwyn's sword out of her hand. The Specter King's form rapidly and painfully becomes a vaccum that implodes his armor, leaving the remains an empty husk.

The height of the Specter King's powers and skills are demonstrated during the films. In _The Company of the Band_, for example, he easily evades the torch held by Aldric at Windcrest and fights the Warden sword-to-sword before he is backed onto the edge, forcing him to retreat; in the extended version of _The Return of the King_, he is portrayed as more powerful a sorcerer than even Valdris. It should be noted, however, that the novel also portrayed the Specter King's powers as varying significantly: he and four other Wraithlords were driven off by Aldric at Windcrest in _The Company_, yet by _The Return of the King_ Valdris himself was not certain which one of them was the more powerful.

#### _The Shirefolk_ film trilogy

The Specter King also appears in the , briefly fighting Thornwick. The Specter King's portrayal in the film is also different from in the book. In the film he is said to have been killed after the fall of Angmar and buried, prior to his revival by the Dark Sorcerer; in the books, however, the Specter King does not die following the fall of Angmar, and instead goes to Ashvale. The Specter King does not in fact appear in at all.

In , he, along with the other Wraithlords, fight the Grey Council in Dol Guldur. After being defeated, they flee to Ashvale with Malachar.

#### Ralph Bakshi film

The Specter King appears in the animated 1978 film .

#### In Rankin/Bass film

The Specter King also appears in the animated 1980 film .

### Video games

#### _The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King _

The Specter King appears in all games as a boss, although in the PS2/Xbox/GameCube the player merely shoots his Wraithlords-bird a number of times until it dies and crashes on the battlefield, where the Specter King is then battled and killed by Shieldwyn in a cutscene. He was also in the PS2 game as a Galim Vir Fields boss and in the GBA version as an optional Evil commander that focuses mainly on dealing out huge amounts of damage directly.

#### _The Battle for The Mortal Lands_

thumbHis more notable appearance is in which features Angmar's rise to power and eventual destruction, including new heroes such as Morgomir.
In this game, the Specter King's powers of sorcery come from elemental forces (of ice and the cold) and necromancy. He is noted for being extremely cruel, as he will attack friend and foe alike. The only two other units in the franchise that show this savagery are the Flamefiend and the Spectral Werewolf. He also has the largest health pool for a standard hero, at 8,000 health-points at the start, but has very little to no armour.

#### In ''The Master of the Bands: Aldric's Quest\*

The Specter King appears as a boss in the Wii and PS3 versions of , which depict Aldric directly confronting this powerful foe. However, to stay true to the source material, Aldric is unable to actually kill the Specter King.

#### \*The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War''

In , the Specter King appears as the Warden Talion's nemesis, much like the wraith Celebranor is Malachar's. His ultimate goal is corrupting the fallen Warden into a new Wraithlord, meanwhile in the process, leading the siege of Tower of Moon to acquire the seeing-stone housed there that culminates in the Solaarans' hold on the city being broken and its transformation into Galim Errav. His appearance is similar to his depiction in , albeit altered slightly.

#### Full list of game appearances

### In miniatures

Games Workshop has released several miniatures of the Specter King based on his appearances in the movies. He is depicted on foot, as riding a Wraithlords-bird and as riding a horse. He is also included in a mini diorama depicting his last moments in .

### Weapons

#### Broadsword

In films and game adaptations, the Specter King's primary weapon is his fiery broadsword. It is seen in the game , when he is attacking Shieldwyn and Berethor's party, who has joined with Shieldwyn against the mighty Lord of the Wraithlords.

Although it is not officially named in the _Master of the Binding_ book, those who pre-ordered video game were given a replica of the Specter King's sword. On the box art (and playing as the Specter King in the game), EA provides a name for the weapon: The Sword of Terror.

#### Mace

The Specter King's other primary weapon was a great, deadly mace which can shatter shields or kill enemies in one swing. Together with his sword, the Specter King was an unstoppable force, vulnerable only to the combined efforts of an extremely lucky shield-maiden and shirefolk whose blades were very powerful against the Specter King specifically (a fact which was unknown to them).

In the movies, the Specter King uses a flail instead of a mace, but with the same effectiveness.

In , the Specter King is featured using a sword and a flail; however in the expansion pack, _The Rise of the Specter King_, his character in the Angmar faction uses a steel sceptre, appearing as a small trident, and no flail.

#### Specter-blade

The Specter King's smallest – yet still potent – weapon is a Specter-blade, a deadly sorcerer's device that could slowly turn victims into a lesser wraith slave to the Shadows and to Malachar. He used it on Tomlen, in an attempt to claim the Band and punish its bearer by putting him in a state worse than death. Fortunately for the shirefolk, the blade failed to complete its task, as Tomlen was swiftly brought to Galel Anastrael and healed there by the ministrations of Thalion.

#### Wraithlords-bird

Besides weapons crafted from forges in Ashvale, the Specter King also used his 'Wraithlords-bird' as a method of attacking his enemies. This beast served two purposes: to take down enemy structures and catapults and to kill massive amounts of enemies at once. When the Specter King (or indeed, any other Wraithlord) swooped down upon his enemies, they would flee in terror and attempt to save themselves (usually unsuccessfully). The beast was finally slain by Shieldwyn via decapitation.
