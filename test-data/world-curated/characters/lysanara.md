## Overview

Lysanara was an amtreadi scholar of ancient artifacts and the beloved of Alkandros cel Tradat. Despite knowing his true nature as a vampire, she showed no fear and their unlikely romance blossomed into deep love. Together they had a daughter, Callidora — a miracle that defied the usual limitations of vampire reproduction.

## Background

Lysanara was an amtreadi scholar who specialized in the study of ancient artifacts. Her path crossed with that of Alkandros cel Tradat, a vampire noble who had been turned centuries before. Unlike others who feared or hunted his kind, Lysanara approached him with curiosity and eventually love.

Their relationship led Alkandros to take a vow of peace, abandoning the violent ways of his past. Together they lived at Castle Rendakul, where they raised their miraculous daughter Callidora.

## Death

Lysanara's life ended tragically during a raid by Solaaran Templars acting on rumors of vampire activity at Castle Rendakul. She died protecting her daughter from the attackers.

Despite Alkandros's attempts to save her, she was killed in the attack. Her death fundamentally changed Alkandros, who founded the Black Hand to protect vampire-kind in the aftermath of his loss.

The Templar Abner Kassem, who participated in the raid, was overcome with remorse upon discovering the young half-vampire child Callidora. He abandoned the Templars to raise her as his own adopted daughter.

## Relationships

- **Alkandros cel Tradat** (Beloved) — The vampire lord who abandoned violence for her love
- **Callidora Kassem cel Tradat** (Daughter) — Her dhampir child, now one of the Dragonmarked

## Legacy

Lysanara's memory lives on through those who loved her. Alkandros sees Callidora as a living reminder of his lost love. And Callidora herself embodies the union of vampire and amtreadi that her parents represented.
