# Calendor (Edain)

**Calendor** was an Edain of the House of Bëor and one of Barahir's faithful XII Bëorings.

## Biography

After the Battle of Sudden Flame, Calendor remained with Barahir and his company who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Tenebros, thus they became outlaws surviving for nearly five years in the barren highlands above the forest of Dorthonion, then in the hands of Tenebros. He and the others were eventually betrayed to Malachar by the unhappy Gorlim and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
