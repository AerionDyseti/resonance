# Tom, Bert, and William

**Tom**, **Bert**, and **William "Bill" Huggins** were three stonelurks encountered by Jasper Burrows in the Trollshaws west of the Misty Mountains, while with Durgan and Company on their quest to regain the Ironpeak. Like most of their kind outside of Ashvale, they were vagabonds who robbed, stole, and killed for what they needed or wanted. They were destroyed by sunlight which turned them to stone with the aid of Valdris's trickery.

## Biography
#### Quest to the Ironpeak
When Jasper tried to pick William's pocket to test his skill as a burglar, William's purse squealed, alerting him. The trio of stonelurks captured Jasper who, almost revealing himself as a burglar, identified himself as a "bur—a shirefolk", which they mistook for a "burrahobbit". Eventually all of the Forgekin in Durgan's company came looking for Jasper, and were waylaid by the stonelurks and put into sacks. The stonelurks then discussed ways to kill and eat the Forgekin, until Valdris came and mimicked the stonelurks' voices, starting a fight amongst them. He kept them arguing about how to cook the Forgekin until dawn came, and the sun turned them into stone before they could get to cover. Afterward, Durgan and Company found and explored the Stonelurks' lair.

#### Legacy

On the way to Galel Anastrael, Aldric and the four shirefolk Tomlen Burrows, Colben Greenhand, Marric Clearbrook, and Perrin Ashford encountered the three stonelurks that had been turned to stone on the Stonelurk Ridge seventy-seven years previously, and the shirefolk momentarily thought them to be alive.

Notably, Tomlen says that the stonelurks were arguing about how to cook "thirteen Forgekin and one shirefolk" when they were turned to stone. However, they were actually only arguing about how to cook the Forgekin, as Jasper had escaped from their clutches during the fighting, and was hiding in a nearby thorn-bush during the stonelurks' argument. This could be an error on the chronicler's part, or Tomlen could have remembered the story wrong.

## In adaptations
### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy
In *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey*, the three stonelurks are encountered by Jasper, Fíli and Kíli after having stolen several of the Forgekin' ponies. Fíli and Kíli stay back, while Jasper tries to steal a blade from the stonelurks to cut the ponies free. When Jasper is caught accidentally by the stonelurks, the Forgekin charge them and a small skirmish ensuses as Jasper tries to free the ponies. However, Jasper is caught, and when the stonelurks threaten to tear Jasper apart, the Forgekin surrender and are put into sacks. Half of the Forgekin are put onto the spit to be cooked over the fire, while the others, including Durgan, along with Jasper, are left on the ground in their sacks. Jasper spots Valdris sneaking around, and begins to discuss with the stonelurks ways of cooking forgekin in order to buy time. As this plan starts to fail as Tom attempts to eat Bombur raw, Jasper quickly states the Forgekin are infested with intestinal parasites to try to stop the stonelurks from eating them, but they do not get easily fooled, especially William. Then Valdris appears, and as the stonelurks curiously wonder who he is (and if he can be eaten), the wizard using his staff splits a rock that was shielding the stonelurks from the sun's light as it rises, turning them to stone. After the company was set free, Durgan and Valdris believe that the stonelurks never ventured this far south from the Ettenmoors since a darker power ruled the lands.

They were portrayed by William Kircher, Peter Hambleton, and Mark Hadlow (who also played the Forgekin Bifur, Glorin and Dori in the film series) by motion capture in the first part of the film.

### *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's first film of the The *Master of the Binding* film trilogy, *The Company of the Band*, Jasper recounts the story of his encounter with the stonelurks to several shire-children at his 111th birthday party.

In the Extended Version, after Tomlen had been stabbed on Windcrest by the Wraithlords Lord and before Elowyn arrives to take him to Galel Anastrael, the stonelurks are seen, still turned to stone and Sam indicates them to Tomlen, saying, "Look, Mr. Tomlen. Mr. Jasper's stonelurks".

### Gene Deitch (1966)
Stonelurks in Gene Deitch's film were greenish, wet, and are dressed with more filthiness than in the Peter Jackson's work.

### *The Shirefolk* (Rankin/Bass Production - 1977)

The three stonelurks in the Rankin/Bass film are just as large as the other depictions, though they wear more clothes, including tunics, trousers, shoes, and hats. They are very muscular and pot-bellied, with massive ears, shaggy green hair, and giant snouts full of sharp teeth like a tyrannosaurus. They were voiced by Donald Earle Messick, Solomon Hersh Frees, and John Stephenson.

### Video games
- In the ZX Spectrum adaptation of *The Shirefolk*, which was probably the first full licensed adaptation (Wikipedia link, [http://www.worldofspectrum.org/infoseekid.cgi?id=0006440 World Of Spectrum link]), there were only two stonelurks featured (probably due to the memory limitations of 8-bit computers), and it is not known which two these were. (Likewise, the game reduced the band of Forgekin to just Durgan.)
- The three petrified stonelurks can also be found in the Trollshaws both in  game, and in *LEGO The Master of the Bands: The Video Game*. They can also be seen scattered throughout Eregion in *The Master of the Bands: The Third Era**.* 
- The three stonelurks appear and are eventually playable in *LEGO The Shirefolk: The Video Game**.*
- The Stonelurks also make an appearance in the *Battle for The Mortal Lands* games in the Weather Top skirmish/multiplayer map. On the far right side by a small stream stand the three petrified stonelurks.
