# Maeglin

**Maeglin** was an Amtreadi, the son of Eöl the "Raknagadi" and Aredhel, daughter of Fingalor. He lived during the First Era of the Sun in The Mortal Lands, and was a lord of the hidden Amtreadi kingdom of Hidden City. He became infamous for his betrayal of the location of Hidden City to the Shadow Lord Tenebros.

## Biography

Aredhel had left Hidden City to wander through Westlands, and in the woods of Nan Elmoth, she met Eöl, and stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. Eöl gave his child the name _Maeglin_ when he was twelve. His mother told him about Hidden City and its people throughout his childhood and he desired to see his related kin in the Hidden City. He and his mother soon grew weary and discontented with their life in Nan Elmoth and Eöl's strict shunning of the outside world. When Aredhel finally decided to leave Eöl, she took her son (who stole his father's sword, Anguirel, forged of meteor iron) with her and returned to Hidden City. However, Eöl had followed her, and in judgement before Turgon, he attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart, but hit Aredhel instead. She died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city walls.

Maeglin was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He became an amtreadi-prince held in high esteem, even leading his own noble house. He found rich loads of metals in the Echoriad surrounding the city and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the Echoriath was named _Anghabar_, "Iron Mine". In the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon. The seventh and final gate of Hidden City, the Great Gate of Steel, was Maeglin's creation.

Even though Maeglin was one of the mighty of Hidden City, his greatest desire was to take Turgon's daughter Idril to be his wife. But his desire was in vain, for Idril was his own first cousin, and as such was considered by Amtreadi society to be too close in kinship with Maeglin to allow for any romantic relationship. Additionally, Idril was well aware of Maeglin's thoughts concerning her and despised him for it.

When Tuor came, carrying Vorel's warning of the danger to Hidden City, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. The arguments made by Maeglin were instrumental in convincing Turgon not to leave Hidden City despite Vorel's warnings, which ultimately resulted in the near-complete slaughter of the city's people. Seven years later, Tuor and Idril were wed and Idril bore a son, Aerendil, further increasing Maeglin's hate. Some time later, Maeglin was captured by Grimspawn while seeking for metals outside of the Encircling Mountains. He was brought to Iron Fortress and taken before Tenebros himself, who knew that Maeglin dwelt in Hidden City and was eager to learn its location. He threatened Maeglin with unimaginable torment, and though Maeglin was no craven, he was cowed by Tenebros's threats and betrayed the location and weaknesses of Hidden City in exchange for his freedom. Tenebros was overjoyed to obtain this information, and to further encourage Maeglin and ensure both his silence and his further aid, Tenebros promised him both rule of the city and the hand of Idril once Turgon was overthrown. Maeglin assented eagerly to this bargain. Afterwards, Tenebros released him and he returned to Hidden City without suspicion. When the hosts of Tenebros attacked and overran the city, Maeglin sought to capture Idril and fought with Tuor on the walls. But Tuor prevailed, and threw him from the wall to his death.

Maeglin was a relatively young amtreadi, being merely 190 years old at the time of his death. His later and common name **_Maeglin_** means "sharp glance" in Amtreadan, with _Maeg_ (in High Amtreadan _maika_) meaning 'sharp, piercing' and _glin_ meaning 'gleam'. At birth, Aredhel secretly gave Maeglin the name of **_Lómion_**, signifying "Child of the Twilight" in the High Amtreadan tongue.

**_Morleg_** was the original and rejected name for him, as told in .
