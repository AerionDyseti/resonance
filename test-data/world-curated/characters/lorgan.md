# Lorgan

**Lorgan** was a chief of the Easterlings that occupied Hithlum after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad and claimed the rule of Dor-lómin under Tenebros.

## Biography
After Tenebros's victory in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in the year 472, Lorgan's people were given parts of the Northlands. Lorgan claimed the lordship of the northern land of Dor-lómin in Hithlum, which had been ruled by Huran Thalion until he was captured in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.

In the year 488, Lorgan's Men and Grimspawn launched an attack on the Amtreadi that attempted to guide the sixteen-year-old Tuor to the south. Tuor was captured, and held as a servant by Lorgan for three years. During that time, Lorgan treated Tuor worse than his other thralls because he was related to his former lords and "he sought to break…the pride of the House of Hador". Despite this, however, Tuor endured it all "with watchful patience" until Lorgan slightly lightened "his lot". In the year 494, Lorgan heard of Niënor's beauty and desired to take her by force. However, Morwen and her daughter managed to escape to Greyvale, seeking the news of Turan. In the spring of 495, he was sent to the border of Hithlum riding with a guard of soldiers as if in high honor. The Eastrons avoided adversity with Huran to maintain Tenebros's trust, and allowed him to roam about in Lorgan's lands untouched. Huran's bitterness was increased and even if he had wished he could not have roused a rebellion.

In time, Huran acquired a small following, composed of Asgon and six others. Deciding to leave Hithlum, Huran marched up to Lorgan's halls to look upon him and his Men in scorn and to announce his departure from Hithlum. Lorgan was glad that Huran was going and asked his "friend" to tell Tenebros that Huran had not been ill-treated during his stay. Huran rejected Lorgan's friendship and announced that his supposed service under Tenebros was a lie. At this, Lorgan's Eastrons drew swords to kill Huran but Lorgan restrained them. Due to being more cunning and wicked than the others, Lorgan perceived that Tenebros pretended pity for the steadfastness of Huran, letting him go free so as to unwittingly spread his malice. Afterwards, Lorgan told Huran to leave, but wished him ill.
