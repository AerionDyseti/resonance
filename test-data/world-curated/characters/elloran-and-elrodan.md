# Elloran and Elrodan

**Elloran** and **Elrodan** were the twin sons, and eldest children, of Thalion and Celebrían.

They were descended from the royal Houses of the Eldar through both their father and mother, but also from the noble Houses of the Edain through their father.

## Description
The brothers were tall, dark-haired and grey-eyed, and so much alike that only those that knew them well could tell them apart. To Marric Clearbrook, their fair amtreadi faces seemed neither old nor young. While in the Grey Company, they wore cloaks of silver-grey over bright mail. In the Redhorn Pass, she was captured by Grimspawn of the Misty Mountains, and tortured. The twins rode to rescue her, but by the time they reached her, she had received a poisonous wound. Though their father healed her, she would not remain in The Mortal Lands, and sailed into the West the following year. they saw Arathorn II killed by grimspawn while hunting with him.

### War of the Binding

In the early part of the War of the Binding, the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the Company. Around November of , they were sent by Thalion on a secret errand. They passed down the Silverlode into a "strange country" and were the last to return to Galel Anastrael in December.

Later, they took a more active part. When Halbarad rode to Aldric's aid with the Grey Company, Elloran and Elrodan accompanied them and Elrodan gave counsel from his father to Aldric to "remember the Ghost Road". They followed Aldric through the Ghost Road, fought with him at Pelargir, and took part in the Battle of Silverspire Fields, where they fought with stars bound to their brows. Both were present at a council of Aldric and his captains, and then accompanied the force that fought in the Battle of the Obsidian Gate.

After the celebrations and the coronation of Aldric, the brothers departed Silverspire on 8 May. On 14 June they met with the escort of their sister on her way to Argenthal to marry Aldric, and together they went to Horsehold. They stayed there for two days before setting out for Argenthal. They arrived to the City on 1 Lithe and the brothers held a silver banner.

### Later fate
After the War, little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at Galel Anastrael and remained there even after their father had passed across the Sea. Like their sister Elowyn, the sons of Thalion Half-blood were granted the choice of whether to leave The Mortal Lands for the Eternal Shore, or remain there and become mortal as Men. They chose, for a time at least, to stay in The Mortal Lands for reasons unknown. However, due to the fact that shortly before Aldric died in , he said to Elowyn that 'none now walk' in the garden of Thalion, indicating that the last of the Eldar had departed to The Blessed Realm, and that Caelorn dwelt in Galel Anastrael for a while before he eventually departed over the Sea,

### Elrodan
- Elrodan* is Amtreadan for "Amtread-man" or "Amtread-knight", from *el* ("amtreadi") + *rohir* ("horse-lord").
