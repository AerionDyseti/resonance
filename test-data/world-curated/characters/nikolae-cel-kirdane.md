## Description

Nikolae cel Kirdane cuts an imposing figure, his broad frame draped in a distinctive crimson greatcoat adorned with numerous belts and pockets - a fusion of old-world nobility and practical merchant attire. His steel-gray beard and weathered features speak to decades of experience, while his amber eyes hold the intensity of his lupine nature. At his hip hangs Nightfang, a sword of deepest black that thrums with primal energy, its presence a reminder of both his martial prowess and supernatural heritage.

## History

Born into one of the ancient werewolf bloodlines of Eastern Hyria, Nikolae rose to prominence through a combination of cunning business acumen and traditional pack politics. What began as a modest trading venture in his youth has grown into a vast commercial empire that rivals even the established Goldman Trading Company. His true masterstroke was the formation of the Order of the Iron Rose, unifying the traditionally fractious werewolf packs under a single banner through a combination of diplomatic finesse and occasional displays of dominance.

## Relationships

As Alpha of his clan and leader of the Order of the Iron Rose, Nikolae maintains a complex web of alliances and obligations. He treats his pack members as extended family, with particular pride in his two sons: [Viktor cel Kirdane](Viktor%20cel%20Kirdane%201f9ca0aafe218193944ee397fde4d9a7.md) , his ambitious elder heir, and [Drayven cel Kirdane](Drayven%20cel%20Kirdane%201f9ca0aafe21816ca53fec99a730e0ed.md) , his passionate younger son. Though he's not afraid to bare his fangs when challenged, his role as a father has always tempered his legendary ferocity. Recently, this dynamic changed dramatically when Drayven was slain by the Dragonmarked, who then had the audacity to taunt him about the kill. Since then, a cold fury has entered his eyes, and his quest for vengeance has become an obsession that colors all his decisions. 

His business relationships remain carefully cultivated, with many partners unaware of his true nature. He holds a particular rivalry with the Goldman Trading Company, though their competition remains largely civil - at least on the surface.

***Lunar Empowerment.*** During a full moon, Nikolae gains regeneration 15 and his attacks count as magical.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Nikolae fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Nightfang's Corruption (Recharge 5-6).*** As a bonus action, Nikolae channels the sword's dark energy. Until the start of his next turn, his weapon attacks deal an additional 3d8 necrotic damage and ignore all damage resistances and immunities. At the start of his next turn, he must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to attack the nearest creature—friend or foe.

### Actions

***Nightfang.*** Melee weapon attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8+6 slashing damage plus 2d8 primal damage.

***Alpha's Roar (Recharge 5–6).*** Each creature of Nikolae's choice within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature perceives Nikolae as two sizes larger.

***Shape Change (Costs 2 Actions).*** Nikolae transforms between his humanoid and wolf form without using his action.

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful one. Werewolves under his command are immune to this effect.

### Reactions

***Pack Protection.*** When an ally within 5 feet is attacked, Nikolae can use his reaction to become the target instead and gain resistance to all damage from the triggering attack.
