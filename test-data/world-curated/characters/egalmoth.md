# Egalmoth

**Egalmoth** was a Gnome-lord of Hidden City according to the early version of the legendarium in _The Book of Lost Tales_.

## History

He was the leader of the folk of the Heavenly Arch. He wore a blue mantle upon which stars were embroidered in crystal, and his sword was bent (none of the other Noldoli carried curved swords). However, he trusted more to his bow, for he could shoot further than anyone of his folk.

When the Fall of Hidden City began, a great part of his folk was in the walls of the northern gate, where the main attack happened.

## Etymology

- Egalmoth\* is Gnomish for "Broadshoulder", and its Qenya form is **_Aikaldamor_**.

In the _Name-list to The Fall of Hidden City_, the following definition is provided:

- "Egalmoth is a great name, yet none know clearly its meaning - some have said its bearer was so named in that he was worth a thousand amtreadi (but Rumil says nay) and others that it signifies the mighty shoulders of that Gnome, and so saith Rumil, but perchance it was woven of a secret tongue of the Gondothlim, yet was he lord of the house of the Heavenly Arch, and got even out of the burning of Hidden City, and dwelt after at the mouth of Sirion, but was slain in a dire battle there when Melko seized Elwing."_ The "thousand" is from the Gnomish word **moth**, which had a definition of ''"moth(in), mothwen 1000. probably = flock. [<< 'moth 1000. mothwen (same.)' Cf. I 270 Uin, II 338 Egalmoth.]"_

When the chronicler developed Amtreadan, _Egalmoth_ became an obsolete name, but he had already used it for a steward of Argenthal in a published work and the name sounded good, so he retained it in later versions as an archaic form. The proper Amtreadan name would be **_Ægamloth_**, which means "Pointed helm-crest", from _aeg_ ("point") + _amloth_ ("uprising flower, implying a crest on a helmet").

## Other versions of the legendarium

### _The Book of Lost Tales_

In an outline of the last Lost Tale, the chronicler considered that Egalmoth and Galdor led the Noldoli back to The Blessed Realm.

### \*The War of the Jewels''

Egalmoth does not appear again in any later texts of the legendarium, except in one concerning Aredhel's escort. While writing the story of Maeglin in 1951, the chronicler named him as one of the escorts King Turgon sent to accompany Aredhel on her way out of the Hidden City to her brother Fingon, along with Aurindel and Ecthelion.
