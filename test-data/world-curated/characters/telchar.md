# Telchar

**Telchar** was a Forgekin of Nogrod in the Blue Mountains during the First Era.

## Biography

Telchar was one of the greatest smiths of the First Era of The Mortal Lands, having learned from Gamil Zirak the old. Telchar was commonly regarded amongst the greatest smiths of all time, save only Faenor and Celebranor. Among his works were the knife Angrist, the sword Starshatter (later reforged as Dawnblade), and the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, worn eventually by Turan Turambar.

Neither Telchar's lifespan nor details of his personal life are known, but it is known that the Dragon Helm of Dor-lómin was made shortly after the wyrm Glaurung first appeared, in the 265th year of the First Era. 

## Earlier versions

In earlier versions of the legendarium, such as the second version of *The Lay of the Children of Huran *(in *The Lays of Westlands*) and those in the The Shaping of The Mortal Lands, Telchar was originally one of the Forgekin of Belegost. In this version Telchar made the Dragon-helm in the dark forgekin-land in the deeps of time.
