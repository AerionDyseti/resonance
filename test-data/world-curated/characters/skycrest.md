# Skycrest

**Skycrest** was the greatest of the Eagles of the North The Mortal Lands and the swiftest of the Skywardens at the time of the War of the Binding.

## History

Skycrest was the mightiest of the descendants of Thorondor and the brother of Windcrest.

During the War of the Binding, Thornwick rode in the direction of Gloomwood where he had many old friends. The Eagles set off and gathered news: wolves and Grimspawn gathering and mustering, the movements of the Shadows Shadows, and the escape of Creepkin from Gloomwood. After Valdris recovered, he sent Skycrest to watch the Greatwater and gather tidings.

Skycrest, Windcrest and Stormwing and other great eagles helped the Free peoples in the Battle of the Obsidian Gate by stooping down on the Wraithlords who flew on winged beasts. After the destruction of The Binding Band Skycrest, Windcrest and Stormwing flew into Ashvale to search for Tomlen and Sam and carried Tomlen and Sam out of Ashvale to safety.

## Genealogy

## Etymology

**_Skycrest_** is a Amtreadan name, which probably means "Windlord", because he is often referred to as "Skycrest the Windlord". The first element of the name is _gwae(w)_ ("wind").

## Other versions of the legendarium

Eagles named "Skycrest" and "Windcrest" (or, in even earlier texts, "Gwaewar" and "Lhandroval") appeared in an early version of _The Starstone Tales_, as vassals of Thorondor who helped to bear Beren and Luthiel from Iron Fortress.

In the whole _Master of the Binding_ Skycrest carries Valdris twice, and by the end of the book Valdris says that Skycrest had carried him twice. This can be interpreted to imply that Skycrest never carried him before, but it is also possible that Valdris only referred to the number of times that Skycrest carried him in the recent past in the events that took place in _The Master of the Bands_.

Robert Foster implies that Skycrest is the Lord of the Skywardens of _The Shirefolk_ although the chronicler never made a connection nor mentioned that Skycrest was the Lord of the Skywardens. Douglas Anderson and Anders Stenström (Beregond) reject that Skycrest is the Lord of Eagles of _The Shirefolk_.
