# Mahtan

**Mahtan** was a renowned Ñoldorin metallurgist of The Far West and the father of Nerdanel, the wife of Faenor.

## Biography

Mahtan was a skilled smith in The Blessed Realm who learned the arts of metal and stonework under direction of the Pantheon God Kang-Somer. He wore a copper circlet around his head and was known for his fondness for metal above gold. Mahtan passed on his knowledge to his eager pupil and son-in-law, Faenor, who surpassed his teacher by becoming the greatest of all Amtreadi craftsmen. When Faenor and certain Ñoldor became more proud and suspicious of other Ñoldor kin due to the lies of Tenebros, and began forging armaments for what would be The Blessed Realm's first war, Mahtan came to regret teaching him. Later, Nerdanel became estranged from Faenor and retired back to Mahtan's house. The servants of Kang-Somer counselled against joining the Revolt of the Ñoldor, and therefore Mahtan chose not to rebel, and remained in The Blessed Realm in peace forever after.

## Etymology

The name **_Mahtan_** might be from the High Amtreadan _mahta-_ ("to handle"), referring to the arts and skill of making. His devotion to Kang-Somer had earned him the name **Aulëndur** ("Servant of Kang-Somer") from _-ndur_ ("to serve"). His alternate epessë, **Rusco**, meant "Fox", a reference to his red-brown hair.
