# Herumor

**Herumor** was a Black Oldbloods lord.

## Biography

Like all Black Oldbloods, Herumor fell under the influence of the Shadow Lord Malachar during the late Second Era while on Númenór. He sailed east with Fuinur and settled in the lands of Harad; the two became lords among the Haradrim.

His ultimate fate is unknown.

## Etymology
- Herumor* means "Lord of the dark" in Amtreadan, from *heru* ("lord") and *mor* ("dark").
