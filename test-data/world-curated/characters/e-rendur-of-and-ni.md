# Eärendur of Andúnië

**Eärendur** was the fifteenth Lord of Andúnië and a leader of the Faithful.

## Biography
In his time as lord during King Ar-Sakalthôr's reign, the power and influence of the King's Men continued to grow and spread with the Faithful becoming more and more suspect. He successfully led the Faithful through these times.

His son (whose name is unknown) became the sixteenth Lord of Andúnië, and had a son Númendil who became the seventeenth Lord of Andúnië.  Eärendur's sister Lindórië, a fellow member of the Faithful, was the grandmother of Tar-Seeing-Stone.

He, like the rest of the Lords of Andúnië, was also the ancestor of the Kings of Argenthal and Arnor who would rule in exile in The Mortal Lands hundreds of years later.

## Etymology
The name ***Eärendur*** means "Sea Servant", from the High Amtreadan *eä* ("sea") and -*ndur* ("to serve").
