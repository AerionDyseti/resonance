# Scorath

**Scorath** was a fire-drake of the Third Era, considered the last "great" dragon of The Mortal Lands. He was drawn to the enormous wealth amassed by the Forgekin of the Ironpeak during King Thragor's reign. He laid waste to the nearby city of Dale and captured the Ironpeak, driving the surviving Forgekin into exile.

For 171 years, Scorath hoarded the Ironpeak's treasures to himself, staying within the mountain until a company of Forgekin managed to enter the Ironpeak and awaken him from hibernation. Correctly believing that the Forgekin had received assistance from the men of Lake-town in entering the Ironpeak, Scorath left the mountain to wreak destruction upon Lake-town, nearly destroying it before being slain by Braden the Archer.

## Biography

Very little is known of Scorath before he attacked, in TA 2770, the Ironpeak and the town of Dale. What information exists dictates that he was created by Tenebros at some point after Nírnaeth Arnoediad for use in his fleet of winged Fire-drakes. He was one of only two of his brood to survive the War of Wrath, and he fled from the Host of The Blessed Realm to hide in the mountains south of Westlands.

### Third Era

In TA 2770, Scorath came from the mountains in the north, attracted by the vast wealth amassed by the Forgekin kingdom of Ironpeak, which included gold, gemstones, silver, pearls, the many-faceted crystals of emerald, sapphire and diamond, and the famed Heart of the Mountain. In one savage attack, he laid waste to both Ironpeak and the neighboring town of Dale, killing any Forgekin or Men who dared try to stop him. King Thragor and Thragol used the secret door to escape, but the wyrm continued ravaging the surrounding countryside long after.

For two centuries, Scorath ruled the Ironpeak uncontested. He spent his days within the mountain lying atop his great treasure hoard, which he guarded jealously. The surrounding domain became a scarred wasteland known to the Forgekin and men as the "Desolation of Scorath." Yet in the year TA 2941, a company of fourteen adventurers consisting of twelve Forgekin, the shirefolk Jasper Burrows, and led by the heir of the Ironpeak, Durgan II Ironbark, entered Scorath's mountain lair by a secret door in a daring attempt to reclaim the ancient treasure from the wyrm.

Jasper, the company's appointed "burglar," was sent into the treasure chamber alone in an attempt to stealthily gather information and steal what he can without waking Scorath. Once inside, Jasper was surprised to find that Scorath was much larger than he had expected and covered in impenetrable armor, save for his underbelly. Aware of this vulnerability, Scorath deliberately had spent years sprawled on the wealth of his hoard, allowing diamonds and hard gemstones to be embedded into his belly, armoring his only weakness. However, while examining the wyrm, Jasper noticed a single bare patch on the monster's left breast, nearest his heart. With this invaluable information, he escaped the wyrm's lair and returned to the Forgekin, sharing his discovery of Scorath's weakness with them, unaware that he was overheard by a thrush, who carried the secret to Braden the Archer in nearby Lake-town.

Returning to the treasure chamber, Jasper attempted to steal a single cup, but its theft was immediately noticed by Scorath, who had woken from his slumber. Amused by the Shirefolk, Scorath conversed with Jasper, attempting to deduce his origins and purpose in the mountain. He quickly surmised that Jasper was aiding Durgan and the rest of the Forgekin company in an attempt to steal back the Heart of the Mountain and reclaim the Mountain. Scorath flew into a rage, erupting from the mountain in a fiery wrath and loosening his flame upon the land. He turned his fury on Lake-town upon the Long Lake and set about razing it.

Amidst the havoc, Braden the Archer, heir to the throne of Dale, did his best to rally the townsmen to repel the wyrm's assault, but their arrows did little against the wyrm's armor. Then, Braden, having been informed by a thrush of Scorath's secret weakness, fired a Black Arrow into the vulnerable spot of the wyrm's belly. Roaring in fury and pain, Scorath fell from the sky and plummeted into the flaming ruins of Lake-town. His death marked the end of the great dragons in The Mortal Lands.

### Legacy
After Scorath's death, Durgan and Company claimed the treasures of the Ironpeak as theirs by birth right. This created a conflict with Braden and the Amtreadi King Thornael of Gloomwood, each of whom wanted a portion of the gold as reimbursement for all the damage Scorath had caused to their peoples over the years. Durgan refused to share the treasure and, as a result, they both declared war on him. The three armies were faced with a fourth-party, an Grim-host out of the Grey and Misty Mountains led by the chieftain Bolgrak of Gundabad, who desired both vengeance and dominion in the North, ultimately resulting in the Battle of Five Armies.

It is said that a vast fortune in gemstones lay with Scorath's rotting carcass amongst the pilings of old Lake-town, but few had the courage to dive for them in later years.

The Wizard Valdris, who had aided Durgan Ironbark in setting the expedition to Ironpeak into motion, had long feared the potential of the Dragon Scorath siding with the returned Shadow Lord Malachar. He would later note the good fortune of the Scorath's destruction, as the fire-drake might have proved a serious menace as an ally of the Shadow in the War of the Binding.

## Etymology
The name ***Scorath*** is derived from the indicative past, 3rd person singular of Proto-Germanic verb *smeuganan* > Old English *smūgan* ("to creep" > "to squeeze through a hole"); Proto-Germanic **smaug* yields Old English *smeag* (through regular sound-changes) (as in Slivven, akin to Old English *smygel* ("a burrow, a place to creep into")).

The diphthong "au" in *Scorath* is pronounced like the "ou" in *sound* or *house*, though the name is often erroneously pronounced *Smog*, most notably in the Rankin/Bass animated movie.

In the Northern language of Dale, the name of Scorath is 'Trāgu'. Additionally, the Black Arrow launched by Braden completely disappeared into the wyrm's body, and the corpse of Scorath severely destroyed Lake-town when it fell. although this doesn't mean that *all of remaining dragons of that time* joined the war.
-  Scorath's first appearance at Ironpeak was 2,770 years after the start of the Third Era and he resided in the mountain for 171 years, a time span being somewhat similar to Glaurung's case where he took about 195 years to mature; Glaurung was "yet young and scarce half-grown" in FA 260 while his presumed birth was in FA 155.
**If Scorath was born in the First Era, he should have been at least 6,212 years old at his death and he wouldn't have been "young and tender" at the falls of the two cities as he said he was.
- Scorath had only mentioned Men and Forgekin of the two cities in the conversation, and it seems inappropriate to consider that he was suddenly referring to those in the First or Second Ages.

## In adaptations
### *The Master of the Bands* film trilogy
Although Scorath makes no appearance in Peter Jackson's , he is indirectly mentioned by Valdris during his conversation with Tomlen near the beginning of the . When Tomlen jokingly tells Valdris that the other shirefolk have officially labelled him a "disturber of the peace", Valdris responds with "if you're referring to the incident with the wyrm, I was barely involved".

Additionally, when Valdris visits Burrow's End, he picks up the old map of the Ironpeak from Jasper's desk, which has an illustration of Scorath on it.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

Scorath is voiced and interpreted with performance capture by Benedict Cumberbatch in Peter Jackson's . Scorath is presented with a long, serpentine neck; a crest of spurs on his head; a crocodilian facial shape; a compact torso with a streamlined shape; spines and spikes along his back and the back of his neck; stocky hind-legs; a very long tail; mostly dark-red scales which turn dull-golden on his underside; and gleaming, orange-yellow eyes coloured like fire, with slit-pupils which possess an intricate, keyhole-like shape. He has a deep, resonant voice with an underlying growl.

He appears in the prologue of the first film, , described as a "fire-drake from the north" before taking residence in the Ironpeak. Only small parts of him are glimpsed throughout the film: his legs, tail, a small part of his head, and his wings as he flies over Dale, and his eye when he is sleeping in his mound of treasure, in the final scene. In addition, he is a topic of discussion amongst the Grey Council as Valdris cites his reason to support Durgan Ironbark's quest.

When Durgan and Company arrive at the Ironpeak and send their burglar Jasper Burrows to find the Heart of the Mountain, the Shirefolk unwittingly causes a landslide amongst the mountainous pile of treasures, uncovering the wyrm. Scorath stirs from his sleep, suspicious that someone is in the chamber with him. Although Jasper is forced to use his Ring to keep out of sight from the wyrm, Scorath is immediately aware of his presence by his scent (whilst the smell of shirefolk is unknown to him). He begins to search for Jasper, beckoning him to come out from where he is hiding and when Scorath gets too close, the Shirefolk is overcome with fear and attempts to run, only to alert the wyrm, who chases after him through the chamber. Jasper evades him and hides behind a massive pillar, still under the cloak of the ring. Scorath continues his search and claims that he is aware of the Band in Jasper's possession and that he sensed that Jasper has something "made of gold, but far more precious," which in turn forces the Shirefolk to remove the Band. Scorath is amused by Jasper's knowledge of who he is, and begins his conversation with the Shirefolk in order to deduce his origins.

During their conversation, Jasper then tries to lie to Scorath by claiming that he is no more than a simple traveler who came to the mountain alone to see the wyrm, as he didn't believe the tales about him. The dragon asks Jasper if he thinks flattery will keep him alive, and asks who he is and where he comes from. Jasper responds in riddles, claiming that he "came from under the hill and over hills and under hills his path had led", and through the air he was "he who walks unseen". Scorath hardly believes him but asks Jasper what also did he claim to be and the Shirefolk answered that he is the "luck-wearer", "riddle-maker", and "barrel-rider". The dragon then reveals that he knows that the Forgekin are outside of the mountain, although Jasper (whose eyes are on the Heart of the Mountain) tries to deny it, with Scorath not taking the bait. Soon, a cat-and-mouse banter begins with Scorath and Jasper, as he makes unfavorable comments about Thragor and boasts about his armor and invincibility. Scorath then realizes that Durgan, Thragor's grandson, has sent Jasper for the Heart of the Mountain and reveals to him that he found out about Durgan's goal "some time ago", and says that it doesn't matter because the quest is ultimately futile, as he is aware that Malachar was preparing to openly declare himself once more.

Later on, Scorath tries to break Jasper's friendship with Durgan by lying to him, claiming that the Forgekin is using him and finds his fate worth nothing, but the Shirefolk refuses to believe him. Scorath is intrigued by his word and wants to know what reward Durgan is willing to give him if he succeeds in finding the Heart of the Mountain, before stating that he will never give away any of treasure, not even a single coin. During the game, Scorath discerns the Shirefolk's attempt at stealing the jewel and keeps Jasper from catching the Heart of the Mountain, boasting about his superiority. During the chase, Scorath shows Jasper his underbelly, coated in gems, and the Shirefolk catches a glimpse of a single missing scale. Scorath then spots Jasper's eye on the jewel and claims that he is almost tempted to let him take it, only to let it consume Durgan to madness just like it did Thragor. At that point, the wyrm ends the banter with Jasper and attacks the shirefolk. Jasper uses his ring to escape and manages to get the Heart of the Mountain while Scorath flies around in rage and unleashes a torrent of flames around the treasure chamber in an attempt to roast the Shirefolk alive before he can escape.

When Scorath sees Durgan pointing his sword at Jasper, asking if he found the Heart of the Mountain, the wyrm charges. The other Forgekin with Durgan appear to defend their friends, and Scorath charges after them, summoning his fire to attempt to burn them to death. However, the Forgekin manage to elude him, and Scorath begins to silently stalk the abandoned halls in search of the hidden Forgekin.

Upon realizing the wyrm is blocking their only path out of the mountain, the Forgekin hatch a desperate plan to lead Scorath to the Ironpeak's forges in hopes that they can trick him into rekindling the smelting vats with his fire breath. They reveal themselves to Scorath, initiating a perilous game of cat-and-mouse through the halls of the mountain, doing everything in their power to encumber the pursuing dragon as they race towards the entrance to the Ironpeak. As Jasper leads the wyrm into the Gallery of the Kings, he is quickly overrun by Scorath, who deduces that Jasper and the Forgekin were aided by the men of Lake-town, and leaves to destroy the town, and when Jasper protests Scorath cruelly and gleefully tells him that now their deaths will be on their heads. As he is leaving, Durgan appears and taunts him, unveiling an enormous, freshly cast golden statue of a Forgekin, which distracts the greedy dragon long enough for the statue to melt into liquid gold and engulf him. However, Scorath survives the scalding gold and erupts from the molten pool, roaring that he will show the Forgekin what revenge really is. He then breaks through the walls of the mountain, shakes off his gold coating, and takes flight toward Lake-town. The film ends with him uttering "I am Fire, I am.....Death!" as he soars towards the unsuspecting town, leaving Jasper and the others dumbstruck at the horror they have unleashed.

In the opening of the third film, , Scorath, after reaching Lake-town, proceeds to destroy the town for their part in aiding the Forgekin. Braden, having escaped imprisonment by the Master of Lake-town, climbs atop the bell tower and begins firing arrows at the wyrm, though each attempt fails, harmlessly bouncing off Scorath's armor. Eventually, Bain, Braden's son, arrives to aid his father with a Black Arrow. Unfortunately, as Scorath flies over, he claws at the tower, toppling most of it. With the bell tower now half-destroyed, Braden is forced to make a makeshift crossbow using a rope that held the bell, some pieces of broken wood, and Bain as a stand. Scorath lands, and looks towards Braden, sneering at his attempts to stop him. Ignoring this, Braden notches the arrow, while Scorath charges him and his son. Braden looses his arrow, which hits Scorath straight in the chest, the shaft sinking into the missing scale. The dragon stumbles, knocking Braden and Bain off their perch, before flying back up. Clawing and biting at the sky, his internal glow fades as he dies in mid-air. Scorath's body, upon falling to the water, lands on Lake-town's corrupt master, killing him.

Even after his death, Scorath's influence is felt throughout the movie. Aside from the damage he inflicted on Lake-town, driving the residents to try and stay in Dale, as Durgan falls under the influence of the wyrm sickness, Jasper begins to hear him speak in Scorath's voice, and Durgan experiences a hallucination of Scorath while walking on the golden floor that they created while trying to 'drown' the wyrm.

Scorath was considered the highlight of the second film of the series. with several critics hailing it as cinema's greatest dragon incarnation. Universal praise was also given to the visual effects company Wētā Digital and the vocal and motion-capture performance of Cumberbatch for bringing a fully realized personality to Scorath.

The  of *The Desolation of Scorath* confirms Valdris the Grey's fears of  Scorath being in league with Malachar as Thragol reveals in Dol Guldur. Should the Dragon have survived its attack upon Lake-town, then the Shadow Lord would have used him to devastating effect against the Free Peoples in the North.

#### Personality
While his personality is more or less the same as the book, in the films, Scorath is considerably more malicious, cruel and borderline unhinged. He takes much more pleasure in psychologically tormenting Jasper, making suggestions that Durgan was just using him, that flattery wouldn't keep him alive, choosing to spare Jasper so that he can watch Lake-town burn and showing pleasure that Jasper cares about the people of Lake-town, telling him that their deaths would be on his head, and sarcastically asking him how he would like to die. Scorath shows himself to be intensely sadistic, contemplating out loud that he would allow Jasper Burrows to bring the Heart of the Mountain to Durgan if only to watch the stone wreak havoc on Durgan's mind the way it did Thragor's, and his voice took on a manic tone when he was particularly excited or riled up. During his attack on Lake-town, Scorath goes out of his way to mock and sneer at Braden and Bain just before he intends to kill them. Scorath is aware of the return of Malachar, and was apparently intent on joining forces with him (although there was some amount of confusion as to whether the wyrm's motives for an alliance with Malachar were).

Though intrigued like in the book when encountering a shirefolk for the first time, Scorath despised Forgekin intensely, considering them wretched and bottom-feeding creatures as he comments on how they'd be naturally urged to come after his treasure. Ironically, some of the unfavourable remarks Scorath made about them could be used to describe himself, showing off the self-contradictory aspect of his personality. Scorath seemed to hold a grudge towards Durgan in particular, possibly due to suspecting the forgekin-prince's greed or knowing about his royal claim on the Ironpeak and its treasure. Likewise, upon realizing the people of Lake-town had been in league with the Forgekin, Scorath displayed a mix of hatred, paranoia and contempt towards them, calling them "miserable", "snivelling cowards", and seething at the recollection of their ancestors' usage of black arrows against him.

Like his book counterpart, Scorath is extremely arrogant, and the mere implication that he may possess a weakness made him visibly angry; being insulted by Durgan was also quick to earn his anger. Scorath was supremely confident in his own powers, shown in his famous speech about how certain components of his body were weapons of destruction. He was utterly ruthless, completely capable of committing genocide either in pursuit of his goals, or more likely for the sheer horrific pleasure of it. Due to his overwhelming hubris, Scorath clearly suffers from a superiority complex, believing himself to be King under the Mountain on account of how he had destroyed the original kings. Scorath's obsession with gold and his own possession of it would be startling enough for Jasper to realise later when Durgan started to show the same kind of sickness.

#### Size and appearance

In the film adaptations, Scorath dramatically increased in size. In the comments of "Made in the Makings", his size is mentioned to be "bigger than two jumbo jets" or "twice as long as and twice as wide as Boeing 747". In pre-publishing comments by Joe Letteri, the Oscar winning VFX supervisor from Wētā Digital, Scorath was said to be "twice as big as a Boeing 747", indicating each wing could be more than 60 to 70 meters in width. These indicate that Scorath in the movies ranged from 130 to 152 meters in length and from 120 to more than 140 meters in width.

Scorath was furthermore designed to be covered in dead and flaking skin like an old reptile, causing slight variations in his scales' colour, and facial scars from past battles - debatably the most noticeable scar in the finished film is one on the left side of his lower-jaw.

In original concepts, Scorath was supposed to be more menacing and wicked, more gigantic, and more serpentine than in the actual movie, and these changes were made to make his character more 'special' to create "a character than a monster". The same trait happened with Creepkin as well.

#### Behind the scenes
The dragon was created with "keyframe" animation, meaning it was animated by hand, in addition to Cumberbatch's motion capture performance. Wētā Digital employed its proprietary "Tissue" software, honored in 2013 with a "Scientific and Engineering Award" from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to make the wyrm as realistic as possible. Cumberbatch aimed for Scorath's voice to be "that bridge between animal and human, something guttural, deep and rasped, kind of dry as well because of all the fire breathing." He studied reptiles at the London Zoo to prepare for the role.

#### Film continuity

In the prologue of the theatrical release of *An Unexpected Journey*, Scorath had six limbs (four legs and two wings), which was his initial design. His forelimbs were among the body-parts that were clearly glimpsed, being bulky in appearance and each ending in hand-like feet with five taloned fingers. It was changed for both subsequent films and also the first film's Extended Edition, where the wyrm has four limbs (two hind legs, and two bat-like forelimbs which act as legs/arms for crawling and as his wings); each of Scorath's winged forelimbs possessed six digits in total; a thumb, two taloned fingers separated from the wing membrane, and three long phalanges joined together by a bat-like wing membrane to form his wings.

Additionally, several scene captures from the first film revealed that his scales were seen to be in blue coloring at the very end of the film for unknown reasons, although this could largely be because the filmmakers had yet to finalize Scorath's design when the film was released or due to the dark lighting of Ironpeak's halls.

The film also deviates from the book in portraying Scorath's underbelly as being as heavily armored as the rest of him, rather than being artificially protected by a coat of gold and gems. The bare patch that Jasper notices is a single missing scale instead, broken off during his attack on Dale, by one of the Black Arrows fired by Girion.

Unlike in the books, Scorath gives no mention to his tail or fiery breath during his speech to Jasper, nor does he use either to smash the mountainside before he flies to Lake-town, although he does breathe fire during the battle with the forgekin, and his tail does cause some (seemingly unintentional) damage to structures around him during the battle in the forges.

### ''J.R.R. the chronicler's The Shirefolk'' (1967 short film)
In  by Eugene Merril Deitch, Scorath's name was changed to be "Slag", "the ancient monster of the Earth". He was slain by Jasper, Durgan's company, and "Princess Mika" (an invented character who was one of three survivors from Ironpeak and Esgaroth along with Durgan) by shooting a large arrow, with the heart-shaped Heart of the Mountain serving as the arrowhead, from a ballista.

### *The Shirefolk* (1977 film)

In the 1977 animated film of  by Rankin/Bass, Scorath was voiced by Richard Boone, and his head appears wolf-like. Unlike the book, the wyrm-spell was absent from the movie and was replaced by light beams to try to find Jasper.

### Video games
- In  (2003) video game release, Scorath was voiced by James Horan. His role in the game is paralleled to the book, wherein he took over the forgekin kingdom and killed all who dared enter with a swift round of his devastating fire attacks. The gameplay consists of: 
**Scorath usually lies in the center of the room while Jasper quietly navigates around him, careful not to raise his detection meter.
**A cutscene shows Scorath asking Jasper who he is and appears to use language effectively.
**Jasper gathers information about Scorath and his one vulnerability under his side where jewels do not protect him; he later tells the Forgekin about what he discovered.
- Although not alive by the events of , the bones of Scorath still lie in Esgaroth. Further, plot lines reveal hints and pieces part of the wyrm's past. It appears that his attack upon the Ironpeak was partially retaliation for the Forgekin' suspected slaying of his lesser kin (in truth, a ploy by Malachar). After the Dragon took up residence in the halls of Ironpeak, the Shadow Lord sent his emissaries to negotiate, although none came back, consumed by the fire-drake's flames; Malachar then had a trusted servant, Karazgar, deliver three tokens to Scorath: scales of Ring-drakes, Thragol's skull and the twin of the axe used to inquire his wrath against the Forgekin. Shaken by fear, as much as he tried to hide it, the Dragon promised that in fifty years he would answer the Shadow Lord's summons to his side.  Shortly before the Grey Council's attack on Dol Guldur, Malachar sent Karazgar to Ironpeak to bid Scorath to Ashvale or end him if he reneged on his word. The Dragon; death, owing to the careful planning of Valdris, deprived Malachar of the beast's fealty and use for war.
- Scorath also appears in the video game , which was released on 11 April 2014.

## Trivia

**Scorath*, a genus of lizards, was named after the chronicler's Scorath.
- Most notably, Scorath was apparently a four-legged western dragon in the first film, but to follow the description in the book, referring to him as a "wyrm", he was redesigned to be a more snake or bird-like wyvern-type dragon in the second film. In the Blu-ray extended edition of the first movie, his forelimbs were changed to winged arms.
- According to Wētā designers, his fire is not magical, but 'fuel-based'.
- Scorath in the movie was designed to be 'multicultural', combining characteristics from dragons around the world.
- In the movie, Scorath seems to have a will of dominance, as he was shown capable of forcing Jasper into revealing himself.
-  Valdris wanted Scorath to be destroyed before the War of the Binding began, because, had Scorath allied with Malachar, it would have meant almost certain ruin for the Free Peoples; the forces of Aranada and Argenthal would not have been able to bring him down without suffering enormous losses. This idea is reinforced in the extended version of *An Unexpected Journey* when Valdris meets with the Grey Council at Galel Anastrael, as he expresses concern at the possibility of Scorath allying with the new darkness, the Dark Sorcerer that Thornwick had encountered (although Morvain dismisses this as nothing more than some human sorcerer playing with black magic rather than recognizing it as Malachar).
**The Extended Edition of *The Desolation of Scorath* confirms Valdris's fear of Scorath and Malachar working together to conquer The Mortal Lands. This explains his vast knowledge of Malachar and the Band, as he alludes in the theatrical version.
**It is possible that Scorath's taking of Ironpeak might have been encouraged by the steady return of Malachar. Valdris carefully planned the Quest for the Ironpeak and the attack on Dol Guldur so as to prevent the two from assisting one another. Therefore, it can inferred that there might have been a possible (loose) connection between Scorath and Malachar, or that the Dragon was potentially open to taking the latter's side.
- Throughout the *The Shirefolk *film series, Scorath is similar to Kilgharrah from the BBC's television series *Merlin* in appearance and near-invulnerability, though Kilgharrah is good rather than evil.
- In *The Desolation of Scorath*, Scorath refers to Durgan by his Ironbark moniker. This may seem like a continuity error as Durgan only earned that name after Scorath's conquest of the Ironpeak; however, it's worth noting that like in the books, the films specify that Scorath was last sighted sixty years before the start of Durgan and Company's quest (roughly TA 2881 according to novel continuity), eighty-two years after the Battle of Azanulbizar's novel-canon date.
- The Westfield Oakridge Mall food court in San Jose Ca was named **Scorath’s Food Court** and contains a model of Scorath which people can ask the following five questions to: how can you talk, how can you breathe fire, what is your favorite place to eat at, how can you fly really well, and can I ride on your back.
