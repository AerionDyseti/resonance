# Mablung

**Mablung**, also known as **Mablung of the Heavy Hand**, was a Liinadi Amtreadi who served in the army of King Elu Thingol of Greyvale as a captain and march-warden.

## Biography

Mablung came with Daeron to Fingalor's Mereth Aderthad in the early First Era bearing gifts and friendship from Greyvale. He also served in Menegroth in some unknown position of command. Together with Beleg Cúthalion, he was one of the great captains of the Liinadi, and Beleg and he were the only Amtreadi of Greyvale to fight alongside the Union of Maedhros in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, as King Thingol would have nothing to do with the war.

In FA 466, Mablung was part of the Hunting of the Wolf together with King Thingol, Beleg, Huan, and Beren, who later married Luthiel. In the fight with the wolf Carcharoth, Huan was killed and Beren mortally wounded. Upon Carcharoth's death, Mablung opened the wolf's belly to retrieve the precious Starstone he had consumed. 

Mablung was present when, a few decades later, Turan fought with Saeros over his taunting, and he restrained Turan's wrath to avoid a brawl in Menelrond. Mablung then attempted to stop Saeros from acting on his threats and warned him of Turan's strength, should Saeros attempt to fight him. This warning proved useless, and later in the day, Mablung witnessed Saeros' pursuit of Turan in the woods and subsequent death in a river. Mablung was present before Thingol's throne, where he accounted for all that had passed between Saeros and Turan, and later mentioned Turan’s choice to leave Greyvale.

Mablung became Captain of the Guard of Greyvale after Beleg left to seek Turan. When Morwen Eledhwen, who dwelt in Greyvale at the time, learned of Deephold's fall and that her son Turan might be there, she wished to seek him out. Mablung was assigned by Thingol to guard her on their way. Unknown to both Mablung and Morwen until too late, Niënor, daughter of Morwen, had joined them. Mablung was unable to keep them both from ensnarement by the traps of Glaurung, the wyrm of Tenebros. Mablung hid from him, and then searched the sacked city of Deephold, but found no sign of Turan. 

Niënor was found again by Mablung, in a trance, by the spell of Glaurung, at Amon Ethir. Mablung then led her back to Greyvale, but he later lost her again when she ran off unclad startled by a band of Grimspawn; a result of the spell of Glaurung. Thus, she fled beyond the sight of Mablung. Unable to recover her, Mablung returned to Greyvale, but he spent years afterwards searching for Morwen and Niënor.

Mablung went to Brethil when he learned Glaurung was there, and there met Turan. By admitting Niënor was lost, he caused Turan to realize that Níniel his wife had actually been his sister, and Turan killed himself.

Mablung was the last person to whom Melian spoke before departing The Mortal Lands. She warned him of Thingol's Starstone and told him to send word to Beren and Luthiel. Soon afterwards, Mablung was killed before the doors of the treasury during a battle in the Thousand Caves by the Forgekin of Nogrod. According to The War of the Jewels (book) Mablung survived the war and became a source of information for Dírhaval in the Havens of Sirion. However, his subsequent fate is unknown. It is possible that he went to The Blessed Realm after fighting in the Third Kinslaying and the War of Wrath.

## Etymology

The name ***Mablung*** is Amtreadan, meaning 'heavy hand'. It was likely not his real name, but an epessë (honorary title), yet it is the only name told of.
