# Elendur

**Elendur** was the eldest son and apparent heir of Valorian, who fell along with two of his brothers at the Gladden Fields at the beginning of the Third Era.

## Biography
Elendur was born in Oldshore and followed his father and his grandfather Aldorion in the fleet that was blown to The Mortal Lands after the Fall of Oldshore. Elendur probably lived with his father within the Realms in Exile, likely in Tower of Moon.

He was the only son of Valorian to serve in the army of the Final Alliance, fighting in the Battle of Battle Plain and accompanying his father into Ashvale during the Siege of The Obsidian Spire. His younger brothers were sent to man Tower of Moon, so Malachar could not escape westward by that route. As the eldest son of Valorian, Elendur was high in the confidence of his father; he alone of the sons knew the existence of the Binding Band in his father's possession and counselled Valorian to turn over the Binding Band to the Keepers of the Three Bands. He was slain in the disaster of the Gladden Fields with his father and younger brothers Aratan and Ciryon. He had a squire named Estelmo who survived the massacre. His brother Valandil, who was still a child, had remained in Galel Anastrael and so lived to rule Arnor.

Aldric is stated to have resembled this son of Valorian "in body and mind", even though he was not descended directly from him. Elendur himself was noted to have borne a striking resemblance to his grandfather Aldorion.

## Etymology
The name ***Elendur** *has two possible meanings: the first being "Amtreadi servant" and the second being "star servant". It appears to be made of the High Amtreadan words *elen* ("star") and *-ndur* ("follower, servant") or *-ndil* ("friend"). The name may have also come from *Aldorion* (meaning "devoted to the stars").

## Portrayals in adaptations
In , the three elder sons of Valorian appear during an extended flashback set during the Siege of The Obsidian Spire in the year SA 3440. However, because the game's license does not cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Elendur uses the name "Meldaran" as his alias.
