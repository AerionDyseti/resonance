# Brandir

**Brandir the Lame** was a Man of the House of Haleth. He was the son of Handir and Beldis and was named after his mother’s brother. Brandir became a leader of his people despite his deformity, yet he became ensnared by the doom of Turan and died by his sword unjustly.

## History
Brandir suffered some accident in his childhood that resulted in a broken leg and left him lame thereafter. Due to his mishap and because of his gentle mood he was never a man of war, taking delight instead in all things that grew in the earth. Yet after his father died Brandir inherited the chieftainship of the Men of Brethil and thus was their lord when Turan arrived in . In order to protect his people, Brandir sought silence and secrecy, far from the other fights of Westlands.

By the third year of Turan's abiding at Ephel Brandir he had become the *de facto* leader of the Men of Brethil; Brandir went unheeded. Turan led the woodmen in many battles against the Grimspawn, yet these deeds drew the dread dragon Glaurung from ruined Deephold, who crawled in a straight path towards Brethil. When Turan asked for volunteers to go with him to meet the wyrm, Dorlas came forth. Seeing the others hold back, Dorlas chided them and asked if none would take the place of Brandir so that the House of Haleth would not be put to shame. Thus Brandir, long unheeded, was subjected to scorn and became bitter at heart.

After Turan, Dorlas, and Hunthor had gone, Níniel decided that she had to follow her husband. Ignoring Brandir's plea that she wait, Níniel led a great company of the woodmen to Nen Girith to seek tidings of the three hunters' fate. Unable to endure the scorn and disdain that had been heaped upon him, Brandir renounced his lordship and people. Yet still he loved Níniel and so, taking up his crutch and a short sword, he hobbled after the throng.

Brandir caught up with Níniel at Nen Girith where she had been stricken upon hearing the far-off voice of Glaurung. Brandir attempted to lead her away to safety but she sped away to seek Turan. Again Brandir was forced to limp after her as best he could. Again he caught up with her but too late, for by then Glaurung had revealed to Níniel that she was in truth Niënor, sister of Turan, and that she carried her brother's child in her belly. Brandir heard Glaurung's words and was so stricken that he leaned against a tree. For a third time Níniel ran with Brandir calling after her but this time he could not catch up, for Niënor cast herself into the waters of Cabed-en-Aras. Brandir was the last man to peer into its darkness and he turned away in horror.

Limping back to Nen Girith, Brandir encountered Dorlas, who had quailed at crossing the Teiglin. Realizing that Dorlas' cowardice had contributed to Níniel's death, Brandir proclaimed his hatred for Dorlas. Dorlas tried to strike Brandir but died when Brandir hewed him with his sword. Brandir then hobbled on to bring the tidings to the people of Brethil still gathered at Nen Girith.

Brandir had thought Turan dead, and thus was amazed when he appeared before the gathering. Brandir then told Turan that his wife was dead and revealed that she had been his sister. In wrath Turan called Brandir "Club-foot" and slandered him, and then drew the black sword Gurthang and slew him. However, Turan soon met Mablung the Hunter who confirmed Brandir's words. Turan ran and asked his sword if it would slay him swiftly. Gurthang replied that it would, to forget the blood of Beleg, killed by accident, and Brandir, killed unjustly.

## Etymology

In *The Etymologies*, the name *Brandir* is said to be a compound of *brand* + *dîr*, meaning "Noble Man".

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In *The Book of Lost Tales Part Two*, "Turambar and the Foalókë", the lame woodman who would come to love Níniel was called ***Tamar Lamefoot***. He was the eldest son of the leader of the woodmen, Bethos, and an Amtread-maiden of the Noldoli, making him Half-amtreadi. Tamar, who was paid little attention to, grew to love Níniel, but in vain. It was Tamar who followed Níniel after the defeat of Glorund, and who watched as Glorund revealed her identity to her. He continued after her when she fled, and saw her cast herself into the stream. Grieved, he returned to the people, and declared that Turambar was dead, and Níniel, who was in truth Nienóri the sister of Turambar, had cast herself into the stream and perished. But Turambar, who was not dead as had been thought, came back among the people. Upon hearing Tamar's proclamation that Níniel was Nienóri, Turambar thought him a liar, and slew him.

In *The Quenta*, Brandir's lameness was attributed to being wounded by an Grim-arrow as a child. He was also noted as uncomely and of less might than many; and for those reasons he yielded rule of the woodsfolk to Turan by their choice.
