# Draugluin

__NOTOC__

**Draugluin**, the **Father of the Werewolves**, was the first werewolf to be bred by Tenebros during the First Era of The Mortal Lands. He was the lord and sire of all werewolves in Westlands.

## Biography
Draugluin was bred of the wolves of Iron Fortress and imbued with an evil spirit sent by Tenebros himself.  Draugluin was a dreadful, old and evil abomination, armed with fangs and claws. He dwelt with his master Malachar in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the former watchtower of Finoran Felagund which he helped conquer. 

He was slain by Huan during the Quest for the Starstone after a long battle, though he informed Malachar of the hound's presence. Beren and Luthiel used his blue pelt to sneak into Iron Fortress.

From Draugluin's foul breed came Carcharoth and countless other offspring. It is probable the many Shadowwolves of the much later Third Era were descended from him, as these wolves could speak, suggesting they possessed *fëar*.

## Etymology
***Draugluin*** means "Blue wolf" in Amtreadan, from *draug* ("wolf") and *luin* ("blue") in reference to his blue hair colour. ***Drauglir*** was an earlier form of the name.
