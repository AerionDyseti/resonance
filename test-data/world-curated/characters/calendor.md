# Calendor

**Calendor Ithlorion** was a Noldorin Amtreadi of the House of Finoran, who was one of the few Exiled Amtreadi in the late Third Era.

## History
Calendor was probably the son of some Inglor and one of the Exiles of the House of Finoran. He lived in or near Galel Anastrael.

Amtreadi Wandering Companies crossed the Shirelands and Calendor knew well Jasper and Tomlen Burrows when they were out in the woods. Around September , as Jasper Burrows was leaving the Shirelands for Galel Anastrael, Calendor met the shirefolk as he waved them farewell in one of their camps above Woodhall. The following years he met him once more, perhaps at Galel Anastrael.
### Meeting Tomlen

In September , he led a Wandering Company of Amtreadi of Galel Anastrael travelling eastwards from the Emyn Beraid, where they went to see Elbereth in the *seeing-stone* that was kept there. On the 24th, they were singing, and unknown to him their sounds drove away a Shadow Rider who was searching for Tomlen Burrows, Colben Greenhand and Perrin Ashford on the road near the Woody End. As they passed by them, Calendor was the hindmost, and seeing Tomlen he greeted him, to his surprise. Calendor initially intended that the amtreadi bid the shirefolk farewell and continue on their way, until Perrin spoke of the Shadow Riders pursuing them. Upon hearing this, he invited the shirefolk to join them, although it was not their custom. He rejoiced after hearing Tomlen's High Amtreadan greeting and gave him the title Amtread-friend.

At night they camped on a hill above Woodhall; they ate and sang, and Calendor discussed the peril that haunted the three shirefolk. He sensed Tomlen's fears and uncertainties about his travel to Galel Anastrael, and was worried hearing that Valdris had not returned as he had promised to Tomlen. When Tomlen asked whether he ought to wait for Valdris, Calendor replied that the choice was Tomlen's, but if he demanded counsel, then Calendor advised him not to wait but to follow Valdris's plans, with trusty companions. However, he refused to tell him more of the nature of the mysterious Shadow Riders, except that they were agents of the Shadow, and deadly. He also spoke with Aldric and sent a message to Thalion.

Two years later, on 22 September , he met the shirefolk once again. He accompanied a riding of great Lords and Ladies, that planned to sail West on board the White Ship and probably he was among the Amtreadi who sailed to the West.

## Etymology
The meaning of *Calendor* is not given, but it can be deduced as Amtreadan "Star Lord", from gil ("star") and -dor ("lord, king").

The same applies to *Inglorion*, which means "Son of Inglor", from *-ion* ("son of"), leading to the genealogical discussion explained below.

## Ancestry
Calendor is one of the less prominently featured Amtreadi, yet he seems important enough to raise questions concerning his lineage, or the identity of this character. Calendor calls himself "Calendor Ithlorion of the House of Finoran". He also says: "*We are Exiles, and most of our kindred have long departed and we too are only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great Sea.*" This may be the case of the reference to the name "Finoran".

The name "Calendor" first appeared in the outlines of *The Master of the Bands* in February 1938, and in the chronicler's notes of that time, "Finoran" still meant the character later known as Finarfin and his son had the older name "Inglor".

However the name *Inglor* reappeared, in High Amtreadan form, for Finarfin (who in the earlier legendarium, was named Finoran). Finarfin's mother-name was *Ingalaurë*. If Ingalaurë is to be translated in Amtreadan according to the sound-changing rules, this would become *Inglor*. Thus, the connection of Calendor to the house of Finoran/Finarfin still remains in the updated legendarium.

This all suggests that, while Calendor might have been initially intended to be Felagund's son, in the final version he may have been a member of the House of Finoran as some other descendant, or servant, not one of Finoran's sons — perhaps one of the knights of Deephold.

It is also possible that he was a son of a supposed "Inglor" — a character unconnected to Finoran Felagund.
