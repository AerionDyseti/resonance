# Creepkin

**Creepkin**, also known as **Slivven**, was a creature (originally a Stoorish Shirefolk) who bore the Binding Band. He lived in the Misty Mountains for most of his life. In  he lost the Band to Jasper Burrows. For the rest of his life he sought to recover his "precious" "birthday present". In  he followed the Company of the Band and met Tomlen Burrows. After leading Tomlen into Ashvale and betraying him to Venomweave he finally seized the Band in Chambers of Fire. In his euphoria he died and destroyed the Band after falling into the fires of Doomfire Peak.

## History
### Early life
Slivven was a Shirefolk of riverland Stoor-kind who lived on the banks of the Greatwater in the later Third Era. Slivven belonged to the reputable family of the stern and wise matriarch. He also knew the riddle-game, and riddles that were known to their cousins in the Shirelands.

Around the year , on his birthday, his friend (and close relative) Daglen offered him a cheap present. Later that day they went boating in the Gladden Fields, and as Slivven was nosing at the banks, Daglen was pulled into the water by a large fish, and found a gold ring. Slivven demanded the ring as a birthday present and strangled Deágol when he refused, and hid his body.

After this event, he returned home and understood he was invisible. He kept his treasure a secret and used it in malicious ways, to see and hear secrets and hurtful things. and was corrupted further by the ring. Soon he became unpopular and his peers avoided him; they often cursed and kicked him, and he bit their feet. Becoming a loner, he muttered to himself and gurgled in his throat, for which they called him *gollum*, and he survived by stealing. Eventually even his grandmother, desiring peace, banished him from their family and shire-hole.

### Into the wild
He stayed two more years in the Mountains although he was disgusted by the empty night, nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He hated darkness, light and the Band most of all, but his addiction to it was so great that he overcame his hatred and fear of the light and the Grimspawn. He left and pursued Jasper,

### War of the Binding
In June of , Grimspawn raided the Amtreadi of Gloomwood (in an obviously coordinated attack) allowing Creepkin to escape. He resumed his search of the Band and presumably, he decided to hide into Shadowdeep in August, in order to lose his pursuers, the Amtreadi and the servants of Malachar. However he could not open the Doors of Grundin from the inside so didn't exit into Eriador to reach the Shirelands. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to Creepkin, and all hope of redemption was lost. Creepkin followed through with his plan and led Tomlen and Sam into Venomweave's Lair. For this service to Venomweave, the Grimspawn of Spider Pass knew Creepkin as "Her Sneak".

Just as Tomlen warned him, Creepkin's betrayal of his oath ultimately led to his undoing, for Tomlen and Sam escaped from Venomweave's lair and came against all odds to the volcano Doomfire Peak. Creepkin followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Band. When Tomlen and Sam had almost reached their destination, he attacked, but failed to get the Band. Sam, who had hated Creepkin on sight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but relented out of sheer pity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten creature.

Moments later, Tomlen was standing on the edge of the Chasm of Fire, but, unwilling to destroy the Band, claimed it for himself and put it on. Then Creepkin attacked again. The two fought whilst Tomlen was invisible and finally Creepkin bit off Tomlen's finger.

Here Tomlen's kindness in sparing Creepkin's life was rewarded, for Creepkin then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance and fell in, taking the Band and finger with him with a last cry of "Preciouss!". Had Creepkin not lived to play this final part, there would have been a good chance that Malachar would have regained the Band, as he knew where Tomlen was as soon as he put the Band on.

## Characteristics
### Appearance
left|thumb|*The Stairs of Spider Pass* by Peter Xavier Price
Slivven was a Shirefolk, but he spent long centuries in darkness and damp, influenced by the power of the Band. It is possible that thanks to his hardy Hobbitish nature that he was not reduced to a wraith. However, he was reduced to a small, extremely thin and wiry person, with scrawny neck, pale skin, flat feet, long thin hands with clammy fingers, and large pale or green eyes that seemed to glow. His sense of sight, as well as his hearing and smelling, was very good, due to the time he spent underground.

He could move and climb silently like a spider, and although he had only six teeth left, he could give deep bites, even able to bite off Tomlen's finger.

### Personality
Slivven was quick and strong, the most inquisitive and curious-minded of his community. He was interested in roots and beginnings. He owed his name to his interest in roots and deep pools; he dove, burrowed and tunnelled under trees, plants, and mounds. He tended to neglect anything that was higher, like the flowers, the trees and looking at the hills. He then came to use Slinker and Stinker to refer to the two contrasting sides of Creepkin's personality, Slinker was the fawning, desperate, and eager-to-please, "Slivven" side demeanour; and Stinker was the plotting and sinister "Creepkin" side of him. When he first came into the service of Tomlen Burrows his Slinker side was more prominent but the closer they got to the Obsidian Gate the more the Stinker side started to take over and Slinker became more like Stinker and Sam started using the name to generally refer to Creepkin.

Other aspects of the Band's corruption was the aversion to all living creatures, especially the Amtreadi and all things Amtreadi. The Amtreadi rope burnt his skin, and waybread tasted like dust to him and choked him.

Slivven, as a Shirefolk, was perhaps good at heart, but he was relatively greedy and mean.

## Etymology

- Slivven* is the translation of an actual Common Tongue name *Trahald*, the meaning of which was "burrowing, worming in" or "apt to creep into a hole". In both Common Tongue and Old English, Slivven's name is related to Scorath's: Scorath's name in "true Dalish" was *Trāgu*, and the *Trah-* stem in *Trahald* and *Trâgu* is thus an analogue of the Germanic stem present in both *Slivven* and *Scorath*.

the chronicler explained in his "Guide to the Names in *The Master of the Bands*" the origin of the name *Slivven* in the lemma on smials:

The name *Scorath*, which means "squeezed through a hole", is thus related.

### Pronunciation

In both the 1981 BBC radio adaptation and in Peter Jackson's films *Slivven* is pronounced as "SMEE-gol", although the placement of the acute accent suggests that the correct pronunciation is "SMAY-uh-gol". On the other hand, in the chronicler's recordings of *The Master of the Bands* he also pronounced it "SMEE-gol" or "SMEE-AH-GOL", suggesting that *éa* should either be pronounced as a long "i"-sound or as a diphthong *ea*, and not as two distinct vowels "e" and "a". the chronicler had a habit in his writing to put diacritics in varying places, as can also be seen in the name *Aerendil*, which also occurs spelt *Ëarendil*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first edition of *The Shirefolk*, Creepkin did not appear quite as wretched or as bound to the Band. the chronicler revised this characterisation to fit the concept of the Ruling Ring developed during the writing of *The Master of the Bands*. the chronicler then explained the version given in the first edition as a lie that Jasper made up to tell the Forgekin and Valdris.

In *The Starstone Tales*, it is mentioned that the Binding Band was found "*ere the Kings failed in Argenthal*". This can mean that originally, Creepkin's age was intended to be considerably more than six hundred years (further reinforced by certain places in *The Master of the Bands* like Creepkin referring to tales about an uncorrupted Tower of Moon or Valdris comparing his people to "fathers of the fathers of the Stoors"). In fact it seems likely that Malachar leaving the Gloomwood in 2063 T.A. and some Shirefolk settling there after that are details added for the purpose of making the smaller age possible; perhaps in order to make it possible for Creepkin and the other characters to have the same language.

## Inspiration
John Garth has suggested that the character of Creepkin carries echoes of the "*night-haunting, man-eating*" ogre Grendel in *Beowulf*.

### Films
'*1977: *The Shirefolk* (1977 film):**
:Creepkin is a frog-like green creature, voiced by Brother Theodore. Here, his "Creepkin" noise sounds like muttering instead of swallowing.

**1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:Creepkin is depicted as a skinny, dark grey creature, voiced by Peter Woodthorpe. 

**1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):*'
:Brother Theodore reprised his role from the earlier Rankin/Bass production. Some footage from *The Shirefolk* was reused to introduce the viewer to the story. 

'*2001-03: *The Master of the Bands* (film series):*'
:Creepkin is a CGI-motion capture creature voiced by actor Andy Serkis. He is barely glimpsed in *The Company of the Band*, where he is voiced by Dominic Monaghan in absence of Serkis. Creepkin becomes a central character in *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*. The ground-breaking CGI character was built around Serkis's voice, movements and expressions, sometimes by using a motion capture suit which recorded his movements and applied them to the digital character, and sometimes by the more laborious process of digitally "painting out" Serkis's image and replacing it with Creepkin's. In one such shot in *The Two Towers*, Serkis' real spittle can be seen emerging from Creepkin's mouth.

:In *The Return of the King* Serkis himself appears in a flashback scene as Slivven before his degeneration into Creepkin. This scene was originally earmarked for *The Two Towers* but held back because it was felt that audiences would relate better to the original Slivven once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Creepkin's face had to be redesigned for the second and third movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'.

**2012: The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey:**
:Andy Serkis reprised his role as Creepkin.

### Television
'*1993: *Hobitit*:**

**1968: *The Shirefolk* (1968 radio series):*'
:The narrator refers to Creepkin (voiced by Wolfe Morris) as "Galloom", even though Creepkin himself manages to pronounce his name correctly. Creepkin's role is based on that of the second edition of *The Shirefolk*.

'*1979: *The Master of the Bands* (1979 radio series):**
:Gail Chugg provided the voice of Creepkin.

**1980: *Der Shirefolk* (1980 German radio series):**

### Games
**1982: *The Shirefolk (1982 video game)***
:Creepkin appears in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. He will persistently speak riddles to Jasper, and strangle him to death if he fails to answer them in time. However, if Jasper puts the Band on, then Creepkin will not be able to see him. He can also be killed by Jasper or his companions, even though doing so would seriously conflict with established canon.
**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):'''
:Creepkin, voiced by Quinton Flynn, is seen thrice: first, in the introduction scene, he is stooping over his precious, dashing away from the camera. He is a creature in colour and clothing much like Jackson's version. He is briefly glimpsed again in Shadowdeep, but not more than a dark shape with a green outline can be seen. His most important role is in the final stages of the game: he can be seen atop several ridges, and can even be visited on a rock on the shores of Nen Hithoel. He throws a fish, the "Xiphiidae", at "Warden". This will become the most deadly weapon in the game, and replaces Dawnblade in the weapon slots. 

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King* (video game):**
:Creepkin is accompanying Sam and Tomlen during Starbridge mission and the is the final boss of the game at the Chasm of Fire. Unlike all other enemies of the game, he takes no damage from any attacks - instead the players must perform combinations to push him into lava below.

**2003: *Sierra's The Shirefolk*:*'
:Creepkin appears in a cut scene after the level "Riddles in the Dark". Only Jasper's last riddle - "*What have I got in my pocket?*" - is shown, after which Creepkin spouts out all possible answers in one sentence rather than in three turns. Creepkin is a dark grey, shire-like creature with seven spiky teeth, who walks on all fours like an ape would, and like his Rankin/Bass counterpart, his "Creepkin" noise is a muttering instead of a swallowing. He is voiced by Daran Norris.

'*2004: *The Master of the Bands: War of the Binding*:**
:Creepkin is a "Hero" unit for the Servants of the Shadow, used primarily for scout missions.

**2004: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands*:**
:Creepkin is a "Hero" for the Ashvale factions. His health is extremely low and his attacks extremely weak, but has value for the scout missions.

**2006: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II*:**
:In non-storyline battles, stealthed Creepkin is roaming the map. If detected and killed, he drops The Binding Band, which can give huge advantage to the side that gets it.

**2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:**
:Creepkin is encountered thrice, though the player has yet to know his name. The first time he is met in southern Trollshaws, where the player prevents him from attacking the baby of two Fishermen; the second time he is seen in southern Gloomwood, where the player must defeat the Grimspawn who attempts to capture him, the third time is on the Shores of Greatwater, where the player has to make sure he does not fall prey to the spiders.

**2012: *Guardians of The Mortal Lands*:*'
:Creepkin is a striker-type "guardian" with four abilities: *Throttle*, *My Precious*, *Coward* and *We are starved*.

'*2014: *The Mortal Lands: Shadow of Ashvale*:*'
:Creepkin is featured in the game as a supporting character. In the game, set between *The Shirefolk* and *The Master of the Bands*, Creepkin is searching for the Binding Band and encounters Talion, the protagonist of the game and helps him in his Quest.

'*2017: *The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War*:**
:Creepkin is featured in the game as a supporting character.
