# Verin

**Verin Snakewhisper** was the chief counsellor of King Theron of Aranada and the son of Gálmód.

Upon Valdris's second coming to Horsehold, Verin tried to discredit him, until the White Wizard managed to heal Theron. After this, "many things which men had missed" were found locked in Verin's trunk and he was given a grim choice: ride into battle with his liege and so prove his good faith or into exile. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Morvain at The Black Tower, where he witnessed the disastrous Battle of Ironspire. Following the confrontation between Morvain and Valdris, he mistakenly threw a "heavy rock"&mdash;which was actually the *seeing-stone* of The Black Tower&mdash;at either his master or the outsiders, for "he couldn't decide which he hated the most". Morvain seems to have punished him severely for this act.

While being held in The Black Tower, Verin became weak and thin and was subjected to Morvain's mistreatment of him. When Rootbeard released him and Morvain in August, they left and headed west. On their way, they were confronted by Valdris, Caelorn, Aelindra and the Shirefolk on their way to northern Dunland. They found them as travelling beggars and Morvain kicked Verin to move on, as he exclaimed how he hated his master. Aelindra told Verin that he was free to leave him whenever he wished but he did not reply and he continued to follow the Wizard.

Morvain had already been exerting his control over the Shirelands from afar by sending evil Men there and puppeteering Lotho Sackwell-Burrows's rise to power, thus the fallen Wizard sought his revenge in petty tyranny as "Sharkin" over the Shirefolk who indirectly ensured his downfall. During this time Verin became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, almost resembling Creepkin, and Morvain shortened his nickname to "Worm" in derision. During this time he murdered the now-useless Lotho on his master's orders, and may have eaten him.

The return of Tomlen Burrows and his companions to the Shirelands resulted in the Shirefolk rallying against the brigands and overthrowing Sharkin. Spurred by the words of Tomlen that he did not have to follow Morvain, and being pushed over the edge when Morvain scorned him yet again, Verin used a hidden knife to slit the throat of his oppressor from behind and then darted down the road. He was quickly shot dead by several Shirefolk arrows, and thus Snakewhisper was the final casualty of the War of the Binding, an unhappy and short-lived wretch who sold his soul to the side of the Shadow and paid the price for his folly. According to Jim Allan this is a good name for a traitor who hides his true face as well as his lust for Éowyn.

- Snakewhisper* is a modernised form of Old English *wyrm-tunge* ("snake-tongue").

## Genealogy

## Inspiration
J. Allard suggests that Verin was based on or inspired by Unferth from *Beowulf*, a character that sits near King Hrothgar and serves as a taunter.

## Other versions of the legendarium
When initially conceived, the character is introduced as "a wizened [struck out: old] figure of a man with a pale wise face". While he is first named "Snakewhisper", his "true name" is initially *Frána*.

'*1956: *The Master of the Bands (1956 radio series)*:**
:Bernard Rebel played Verin.

**1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:Verin Snakewhisper was voiced by Michael Deacon.

**1979: *The Master of the Bands* (1979 radio series):**
:John Vickery played Verin.
**1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):**
:Paul Brooke played Verin.  He is introduced much earlier than in the book in excerpts from The Hunt for the Band when he is questioned by the Wraithlords on his way to Ironspire. His death at Burrow's End is also included in the final episode.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Verin Snakewhisper is played by Karl Lieffen.

**2001-03: *The Master of the Bands* (film series):*'
:Verin is played by Brad Dourif. The reason for Verin's pale and emaciated appearance in the movie is not entirely clear. Perhaps it is meant to suggest that by throwing in his lot with Morvain he has started down the same path to physical and mental corruption that caused Creepkin to become a twisted parody of his original self, although it is just as likely that Jackson simply wanted to make it clear that Snakewhisper was one of the "bad guys" in what may seem a large and confusing cast of characters to the audience.

:The events of "The Scouring of the Shirelands" do not appear in the film version, so Morvain's death was moved to an earlier scene. Other than the location, which was moved to the Tower of The Black Tower, the manner of their deaths is very much the same. As in the book, Verin kills Morvain, but by stabbing him in the back, not slitting his throat. Morvain's body then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, one of the remnants of his infernal machines. Verin himself is shot by an arrow fired by Sylvorn, thereby mirroring his death in the book. This scene was to have included a line where Morvain blamed Verin for killing Theodric, replacing Lotho in the context of that scene, but the line was cut out.

'*2002-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):**
:The voice of Verin is provided by Ivan Gogál.
