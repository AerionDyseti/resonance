# Nori

**Nori** was a Forgekin of Grundin Folk. He had a brother named Dori as well as a cousin named Ori, and was a remote kinsman of Durgan Ironbark.

He played the flute, and was very fond of regular and plentiful meals like his Shirefolk friend, Jasper Burrows.

## Biography
### Early life
Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both shared Jasper's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Ironpeak, Nori lived in Durgan's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

### Quest of Ironpeak
In TA 2941, Nori, along with Dori and Ori, became part of Durgan and Company, befriending Jasper Burrows and traveling with him in search of Scorath's treasure in the Ironpeak. After their experience in Goblin-town when the company was pursued by Shadowwolves and Grimspawn and forced to climb up into some trees, Nori was the first realize that Jasper had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued Jasper.

Nori did little to distinguish himself during the Forgekin's adventures in the wild, though he shared the same array of experiences as the others of the Company: captured in turn by Stonelurks, Goblins, Spiders, and Amtreadi, they eventually reached the distant The Ironpeak and recovered it for Grundin Folk.

Nori fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies and returned to the Ironpeak where he established himself and grew rich. During the War of the Binding, Nori was still living in the Ironpeak, and possibly fought in the Battle of Dale against the Easterlings.

The studio released the following description of Nori in the films:

''"Perhaps the most elusive member of The Company of Durgan Ironbark, Nori is often in trouble with the Dwarvish authorities. Deciding it might be a good time to leave town, he readily joins the Quest for the Ironpeak, not realizing the journey ahead may well lead him into far more trouble than he has left behind. Nobody ever quite knows what the quick-witted and wily Nori is up to, except that it's guaranteed to be dodgy and quite possibly illegal. Despite rarely seeing eye-to-eye with his brothers Dori and Ori, he is nonetheless immensely loyal and will protect them by whatever means possible."*

### Video games
-  *The Master of the Bands Online*
In , Nori lives in Ironpeak during and after the War of the Binding, holding the position of the Keeper of the Coffers. He is first found in the Gatehouse of the Ironpeak, where he and his brother Dori brief the player on breaking the Siege of Ironpeak. After the battle, Nori and the other surviving Forgekin of the Company join Dís in paying respect to tomb of Durgan Ironbark. Under the illusion that after the downfall of Malachar great wealth could now be reclaimed from the ancient forgekin-holds left to ruin in the Ered Mithrin, Nori breaks the direct edict of King Durgan Stonehelm and in secret leads a small expedition to reclaim the wealth of the Longbeards in Thikil-gundu, "The Steel Keep". His brother Dori forms a small band of Forgekin to rescue him from his folly, including his old companions Bofur and Glorin, and together with the player search for Nori's trail across the Ered Mithrin. They eventually find him in the Steel Keep, by which time Nori had realized the error of his thinking, as the demise of Malachar did nothing to evil creatures that have since long made the Longbeard halls their home. The Forgekin then set out for the journey back to Ironpeak with the exception of Glorin, who continues the adventure alongside the player.
