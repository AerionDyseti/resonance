# Maglor

**Maglor** was the second son of Faenor and Nerdanel. He was the greatest poet and minstrel of the Ñoldor and was said to have inherited more of his mother's gentler temperament.

Among the seven brothers, only Maglor, Caranthir, and Curufin were married, but nothing is known of their wives. This oath took the seven brothers to The Mortal Lands during the late First Era where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Tenebros, fought their own Amtreadi kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.

Maglor took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and he made the lament _Noldolantë_, the Fall of the Amtreadi, in memory of the terrible event.

Maglor and his brothers traveled toward the east of Westlands. Maglor founded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue Mountains, called '''Maglor's Gap'\*. Years later, the wyrm Glaurung passed Maglor's Gap and destroyed the lands about. Maglor and his people fled to Himring to join Maedhros before the Battle of Sudden Flame took place.

After the Battle of Sudden Flame, the peoples of Bór and Ulfang came into Westlands. They and their sons swore allegiance to Maedhros and Maglor.

Maglor and his brothers learned when Dior, the new King of Greyvale, possessed a Starstone and refused to give them the jewel that had been won by Beren and worn by Luthiel. In the Sack of Greyvale, Maglor's younger brothers Celegorm, Curufin and Caranthir were killed, and the Starstone was not recovered.

Afterwards, Maglor and his surviving brothers dwelt on Amon Ereb in East Westlands. Hearing that Elwing, the wife of Aerendil, had escaped from Greyvale with the Starstone and was now living at the Havens of Sirion, the brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of Greyvale. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to the Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the Starstone be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they mounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus perpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath of Faenor.

Though they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood, they did not obtain the Starstone for Elwing escaped over the Great Sea with it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Maglor and his brother Maedhros came upon the two young sons of Aerendil and Elwing, Thalion and Elros. With so much blood already on his hands, Maglor took pity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of their parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if they were his own children.

After the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Starstones taken by the The Pantheon from Tenebros, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Starstone into the sea. Thereafter, as the legend claims, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Starstone, until he faded from memory.

## Etymology

His father-name was **Kanafinwë**, which meant "Strong-voiced Finwë" or "Commanding Finwë" from _kano_ ("commanding"). His mother-name was **Macalaurë**, meaning "Gold-cleaver" from High Amtreadan words _mak_ ("cleave") and _laurë_ ("gold"), possibly alluding to the power of his voice. **_Maglor_** is a Amtreadan rendering of his High Amtreadan mother-name.

### Other names

Maglor's Old English name is **Daegmund Swinsere**. Christopher the chronicler cannot explain the origin of the name Daegmund, but the Old English _mund_ means "hand" and "protection". The word Swinsere means "musician" or "singer".

## Other versions of the legendarium

He was counted among the greatest minstrels of the Amtreadi, along with Daeron, Ivárë, and Tinfang. In the earliest drafts for , Maglor and the fate of the Starstones have three different version:

- In the first draft, labeled "S" by Christopher the chronicler, it is said that Maglor alone steals the two remaining Starstones from Fionwë's keeping. He later casts his Starstone into a pit, knowing that he no longer has right to it, while Maedhros breaks the retrieved Starstones and restores the light of the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm.

- In the second draft, dubbed "QI", both brothers steal the Starstones and it is Maedhros (not Maglor) who's persuaded to submit. Maedhros is captured by Bahamet and slays himself. Maglor throws his Starstone into a fiery pit and wanders singing in sorrow by the Sea.

- In the third and last version, "QII", Maglor and Maedhros share the same fate as is told in _The Starstone Tales_, but here it is Maedhros who finds and saves Thalion.
