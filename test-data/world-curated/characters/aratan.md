# Aratan

**Aratan** was the second son of Valorian, and a brother of Valandil.

## Biography

Aratan did not take part in the invasion of Ashvale or the Siege of The Obsidian Spire. Instead, his father sent he and his brother Ciryon to Tower of Moon with a force in case Malachar should break or escape the siege through Cirith Dúath, and assail the Duskwardens before he was yet defeated. He like his brothers Elendur and Ciryon, were slain at the Gladden Fields.

## Etymology

The name ***Aratan*** is a High Amtreadan word that translates into the Common Speech as "Royal Man". Its second element *atan* is the root of *Atani*, the ancient High Amtreadan word for mankind.

## Portrayals in adaptations
In , the three elder sons of Valorian appear in an extended flashback set during the Siege of The Obsidian Spire in the year S.A. 3440. However, because the game's license does not cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Aratan uses the name "Ornaher" as his alias.

## Earlier versions of the legendarium

The forerunning name for the character Aratan was *Eärnur*.
