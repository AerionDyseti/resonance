# Aldorion

**Aldorion** (High Amtreadan: "Amtread-friend" or "Star-lover"), also known as **Aldorion the Tall**/**the Fair** or **Voronda** ("The Faithful"), was a man of Oldshore and the father of Valorian and Anareth who led the survivors of its Downfall to the shores of The Mortal Lands where they founded two Realms in Exile: Arnor and Argenthal. Thus, Aldorion became the first King of both realms and held the title of first High King of the Duskwardens, making him supreme overlord of all exiled Oldbloods in the lands east of the Great Sea. Aldorion was killed alongside his friend, the High King Astorion, by the Shadow Lord Malachar at the Siege of The Obsidian Spire, in the War of the Final Alliance in the late Second Era.

## Biography

### Life in Oldshore

Aldorion was born in 3119 of the Second Era in Oldshore, son of Amandil, Lord of Andúnië and leader of the Faithful (those who remained loyal to the The Pantheon), who maintained a strong friendship with the Amtreadi and preserved the old ways against the practices of Ar-Pharazôn and Malachar. For this Malachar hated Amandil, and by extension Aldorion, the most out of all the Oldbloods.

When Ar-Pharazôn and Malachar were preparing their assault on The Blessed Realm, Amandil told him to gather the Faithful in Rómenna and escape to The Mortal Lands. Aldorion did as his father bade, and gathered the Faithful and their wives and children in 9 ships, and waited just off the coast.

### Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men

In time Malachar returned to Ashvale and began to rebuild his power. In SA 3429, he attacked seizing Tower of Moon. Valorian went north to take counsel with his father, leaving Anareth in charge of the defence of Argenthal. In SA 3434, Aldorion and Valorian returned south together with the Amtreadi High King Astorion and their combined armies, in the Final Alliance of Amtreadi and Men.

After defeating Malachar's armies and advancing into Ashvale itself, the armies of Amtreadi and Men settled into a siege of the main tower of Malachar: The Obsidian Spire. During this siege Anareth was killed.
After seven years of siege, in SA 3441 Malachar came out to personally do battle with his enemies. Aldorion, together with Astorion, overthrew Malachar, but they were both killed in the process, and the Shattered Blade broke when he fell.

Valorian used his father's broken sword to cut the Binding Band from Malachar's hand. Vanquished, Malachar's spirit fled. Valorian built a hidden tomb for his father on the summit of the hill of Amon Anwar, the midpoint of Argenthal. Later, with the creation of the Kingdom of Aranada, the Steward Cirion had Aldorion's casket moved to Rath Dínen in Galim Vir.

### Legacy

Leading the remnant of the Faithful Oldbloods to The Mortal Lands, Aldorion established strong regimes there and created the great alliance that put an end to Malachar's power for over a thousand years. His bloodline and spirited leadership survived in the Duskwardens of the North and South of The Mortal Lands, that would in turn sire the brave and heroic Men that would help bring a final end to Malachar in the War of the Binding.

Aldric's battle-cry in the was "Aldorion!"_._

#### The Oath of Aldorion

In High Amtreadan:''Et EärelloEndorenna utúlienSinome Maruvanar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-Metta\*

Translation:_Out of the Great Sea to The Mortal Lands I am come.In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'"_

This oath was sung an age later by Aldric II Stonehelm, during his coronation at the end of the War of the Binding.

## Description

Aldorion was nicknamed "the Tall", because, even by the lofty Oldbloods standards, he was exceptionally tall, at 2.5 \*rangar'' or around 7'11. He was known as the greatest warrior of all the Duskwardens and the sword Starshatter and the great horn Windbeam were his heirlooms.

## Etymology

- Aldorion* meant either "Amtread-friend" or "Star-lover" in High Amtreadan. It was originally conceived when the chronicler was reading Anglo-Saxon texts, and came across the word *Elendel\*; and to him it seemed a name of surpassing beauty, and could not resist putting it in the Legendarium.

## In adaptations

### _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

Aldorion has a brief appearance in at the Battle of the Final Alliance, played by Peter McKenzie. Unlike in the books, Aldorion is killed by a blow from Malachar attempting to do battle, instead of in a duel with him alongside Astorion. Instead, Valorian alone deals the fatal blow to the still-living Malachar by cutting off his fingers with the broken blade of Starshatter, and with them the Binding Band. Another deviation is Aldorion's height; he is shown to be near the same height as most of his troops.

### _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

An alternate Aldorion is a major character in Amazon Studios' series , portrayed by Lloyd Owen. The setting precedes the Fall of Oldshore and is thus before Aldorion's reign in The Mortal Lands. He is altered as a character, having no exceptional height, and being barely familiar to the Queen as if he were not the son of the Lord of Andúnië.

Aldorion begins the series as a captain in Oldshore's Sea Guard, and father of Valorian, Anareth, and Eärien. On the high seas, he discovers a ruined raft with the unconscious forms of Aelindra and Halbrand, whom he takes back to the royal palace in Armenelos and presents to Queen-regent Míriel. Aelindra demands passage back to The Mortal Lands, and nearly incites hostility before Halbrand intervenes and arranges an agreement for a period of three days to be given for consideration of their request.

Míriel summons Aldorion to return privately, and questions him about his motives in bringing Aelindra to Oldshore, to which Aldorion replies that it was the sea's will, then charges Aldorion with ensuring Aelindra does not attempt to leave the island before a decision has been reached. This Aldorion does, and is initially met with resentment from Aelindra before he reveals himself to be an Amtread-friend, and a speaker of High Amtreadan. Upon learning of the existence of Oldshore's Hall of Lore, Aelindra asks to travel there, and Aldorion accompanies her, and shows her that the hall was founded by Elros himself.

Aldorion then returns to Armenelos and meets Valorian and Eärien for dinner, where he learns of Eärien's acceptance into the builder's guild, and of Valorian's wish to defer the sea-trials to become part of the Sea Guard, and rather meet his brother Anareth in the west of the island. Aldorion warns Valorian against this, expressing the belief that he and his family must move on with the times, or lose their future.

Soon afterwards, Aldorion accompanies Aelindra to an audience with Míriel, in which Aelindra demands Oldshore's backing to save the Southlands from Malachar. Upon Míriel denying this, Aelindra demands an audience with Tar-Seeing-Stone, which prompts Míriel to put the Amtreadi in prison. After eventually agreeing reluctantly to leave Oldshore alone, Aldorion escorts Aelindra to her boat. It is just then that the leaves of Nimloth begin to fall, causing Míriel to rethink her decision, and command that an army be sent to return with Aelindra. Aldorion is put in charge of recruiting volunteers, of which Valorian becomes one of the first, though Aldorion initially bars him from going, focusing instead on training the volunteers with Aelindra's help. Though Kemen partly sabotages the mission, burning two of the five ships allotted to go, Aldorion leads the new troops in departing Oldshore ten days after Míriel's announcement. Towards the end of the voyage, Aldorion speaks briefly to Aelindra after the latter meets Valorian, and reveals that his wife perished by drowning after Aelindra inquires.

Upon landing in The Mortal Lands on the east bank of the Greatwater, Aldorion leads the Oldbloods cavalry through what will one day be known as the Specter Vale into the Southlands, coming to Tirharad at daybreak just in time to save the surviving villagers besieged by Adar. Though Aldorion is pulled off his horse, Halbrand saves him with a timely spear throw, and Valorian rushes to his side. The Oldbloods make short work of the remaining Grimspawn, and afterwards celebrate with the villagers, introducing Halbrand as the Southlanders' rightful king. Aldorion speaks to Valorian outside the village, comforting his horse Berek by speaking Amtreadan, causing Valorian to wonder. Aldorion promises to teach his son how to replicate the feat, but the two are startled when Doomfire Peak suddenly erupts and take cover as ash blankets the Southlands.

Aldorion helps lead Míriel back to the camp on the opposite side of the Shadow Mountains, though he realizes she was blinded by the ash, and is soon brought news that Valorian is believed to have perished saving the Queen Regent. After being tended to at the camp, Míriel announces her intentions to soon return to The Mortal Lands, grieving and angering Aldorion. He still continues to faithfully aid Míriel however on the voyage back to Oldshore, and reaffirms his commitment to the cause of the Faithful.

### _The Master of the Bands Online_

In , Aldorion appears in several flashbacks depicting the War of the Final Alliance. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than to the films: he and Astorion seen battling and defeating Malachar at the cost of their lives, with Aldorion dealing the killing blow.
