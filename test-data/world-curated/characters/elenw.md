# Elenwë

**Elenwë** was a Vanyarin amtreadi, the wife of Turgon and the mother of Idril, to whom she passed on the golden hair of her kindred.

## Biography

Elenwë was probably born in The Blessed Realm sometime during its Noontide. Elenwë followed her husband Turgon to The Mortal Lands when his brethren resolved to join the House of Faenor in their pursuit of Tenebros and quest to regain the Starstones. Unfortunately, she along with many others died during the crossing of Helcaraxë; Turgon almost perished trying to rescue her. It was said that her body was covered in ice and was therefore unable to be saved.

She was the only known Amtreadi amtreadi to have ever left The Blessed Realm; after her death her bloodline survived through her grandson Aerendil and great-grandsons Thalion and Elros, onward into the royal Oldshore-line. Her other descendants included Elowyn and her brothers Elloran and Elrodan.

## Etymology

***Elenwë*** means "Star person" in High Amtreadan from *elen* ("star") and the prefix *-wë* ("person").

## In other versions

The earlier name for Elenwë was ***Alairë*** (later *Anairë*). However, the chronicler corrected this and made Anairë Fingalor's spouse and Turgon's mother.
