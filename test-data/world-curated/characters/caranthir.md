# Caranthir

**Caranthir**, one of the Sons of Faenor, was also the harshest and the quickest to anger. He was known as "Caranthir the Dark".

## History

As with the other Sons of Faenor, Caranthir was bound by the Oath of Faenor to recover his father's Starstones, which had been stolen by the Shadow Lord Tenebros. This oath brought the Amtreadi to The Mortal Lands near the end of the First Era. Angrod of the House of Finarfin was the first messenger of the Amtreadi to come to King Thingol who gave his permission to the Amtreadi to dwell in some free lands, but not in Greyvale, as he considered himself Lord of Westlands. Angrod informed the Amtreadi of this during their council in Mithrim, and Maedhros laughed at Thingol's claims, remarking that Thingol had merely given them lands in which he had no power. But Caranthir despised the children of Finarfin, and spoke in anger against Angrod, saying that he ought not to have been the spokesperson of the Amtreadi. Maedhros rebuked him, but division between Amtreadi increased after the outburst.

The people of Caranthir went to the furthermost East Westlands, reaching Blue Mountains, and there they became the first of Amtreadi to encounter the Forgekin. Caranthir disliked the Forgekin for their unloveliness, but though there was little love between the two peoples, they allied against their common enemy: Tenebros. The alliance brought great profit, for all the trading that came to Westlands from the Forgekin went first through Caranthir's hands, and he gained great wealth. Caranthir's realm was in Thargelion, and was sometimes called *Dor Caranthir* ("Land of Caranthir"). His abode was on the shores of Lake Helevorn.

In , Caranthir rescued Haleth and her people, the Haladin, when they were besieged by Grimspawn. At last recognizing the valour of Men, he offered the Haladin a fiefdom in his lands to the North. However, Haleth's heart was proud, and wanting her people to serve no lord she thanked him but removed to the Forest of Brethil.

In the Battle of Sudden Flame, Caranthir was forced to retreat and joined the remnant of his people to the scattered folk of Amrod and Amras. They fled to the south and maintained a watch upon Amon Ereb, aided by the Laegil.

In , the Easterling Ulfang led his people over the Blue Mountains, and they allied themselves with Maedhros. They swore allegiance to Caranthir, whom they followed,

In , the disaster of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears") occurred, caused by the betrayal of the people of Ulfang, and the sons of Faenor were scattered. 

In , he perished along with his brothers Celegorm and Curufin during the Second Kinslaying, the attack by the Sons of Faenor on Menegroth in an attempt to recover a Starstone from King Dior Eluchíl of Greyvale.

## Etymology

- Caranthir* is the Sindarized version of his mother-name **Carnistir** ("Red-face"), being the compound of *caran* + *thir*. He was given this name as he inherited his mother's ruddy complexion,

Caranthir's father-name was ***Morifinwë*** ("Dark Finwë"), as he was black-haired as his paternal grandfather. The short version of the name was ***Moryo***.

An earlier variant of his name was **Cranthir** (N. "perfect"); it was alternatively spelled as **Cranthor**.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In The Nauglafring, from the second volume of *The History of The Mortal Lands*, he dies beside Celegorm in the attack on Dior's realm.

While in the published Silmarillion Caranthir is recorded as the fourth son of Faenor, in *The Shibboleth of Faenor* Curufin is explicitly numbered as the fourth. It may be assumed that this was intended to refer to *Celegorm* instead.
