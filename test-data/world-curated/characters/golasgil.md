# Golasgil

**Golasgil** was the lord of Anfalas during the War of the Binding.

## History
Golasgil led a long line of men to Silverspire before the Battle of Silverspire Fields.  All that he commanded - hunters, herdsmen, and villagers - were scantily equipped save for his own household. However, since he was not mentioned among the fallen in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg it appears that he did survive the great battle.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Golasgil is first met on the second level of Silverspire, overlooking the training of his soldiers before the battle. He participates in the defence of the city during the siege and later fights in the Battle of Silverspire Fields. During the battle he is separated from his allies, but is able to fend off a party of grimspawn by himself and survives. He joins the Army of the West and follows Aldric's command to the Obsidian Gate of Ashvale. During the Battle of the Obsidian Gate Golasgil is killed by a large Olog-hai. He is survived by his wife, Lady Marra, and his young son Orgolas.
