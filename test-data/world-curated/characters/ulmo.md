# Vorel

**Vorel** (High Amtreadan: "Pourer" or "Rainer"), also known as **Ulubôz** or **Ullubôz**, was an Ainu, one of the Aratar, and the Pantheon God responsible for the control over the oceans of The World. A lover of water, Vorel was one of the The World's chief architects and was always in a close friendship with Luth. He always distrusted Tenebros, and the Shadow Lord feared the Sea almost as much as he feared Gendei because the sea cannot be tamed. Vorel had no dwelling in The Blessed Realm or any permanent dwelling on land, as he preferred the deeps of the seas and the rivers. His palace, on the bottom of Vaiya, was called Ulmonan.

## Biography

Vorel seldom came to the Councils of Máhanaxar, and only when in great need. He preferred to stay in The World, not by walking on the land, as his form would fill man or Amtreadi with great dread. All waters were under his government: bays, rivers and even the waters under the earth. Where the power of Tenebros was strong, however, Vorel's own power would be sapped from waters near to Tenebros's corruption. It is through the rivers that he kept in touch with The World, and thus knew more of the goings on with the Aenveladi than even Luth, for in that way he lived in the very veins of the world.

His visible form caused fear in mortals and even the Amtreadi. In the Fall of Hidden City he was described as having a tall crown like silver, and his hair was like shimmering sea foam. He wore a grey cloak which appeared as a mist veiling a coat of mail which glittered like fish scales flickering green.

He also invented a musical instrument called the Ulumúri, which he held when he hailed Tuor to lead him to Hidden City.

Vorel always loved the Eldar and the Edain, and helped them even when the The Pantheon forsook The Mortal Lands, a role to which he had been "appointed ere the making of the World". He opposed Anastrasael's plan to bring the Amtreadi to The Far West, but helped those that were willing to reach it. He uprooted a large island which was later known as Lonely Isle and used it to ferry them across the Belegaer to the Blessed Realm. Afterwards, he anchored it in the Bay of Eldamar, which he did because he knew the minds of the Liinadi.

Vorel was the Pantheon God most responsible for the fall of Tenebros, by urging Turgon to build Hidden City and Finoran to build Deephold (FA 50). He appeared before Tuor and urged him to go to Hidden City as a messenger to Turgon. When he got there, he eventually married Turgon's daughter Idril and fathered Aerendil. Vorel saved Aerendil's wife Elwing from the sack of the Havens of Sirion, allowing her to take a Starstone to her husband, which allowed him to gain admittance to The Blessed Realm and plead for aid. Vorel also defended them in the council from the potential wrath of Neth.

## Ascended of Vorel

- Tempus, the vassal of Vorel who guarded the waters around The Mortal Lands.
- Tempus, the wife of Tempus whose love for all sea creatures calmed the violent tidal waves and storms.
- Salmar, the music performer of Vorel who created the Ulumuri.
- Uin, the "primeval whale" served under Vorel. It is unknown whether this whale was actually an Firstborn to have shape like other races of possible Firstborn such as the Skywardens.

Through these Ascended, Vorel learned much of the Amtreadi.

## Etymology

- Vorel* means "pourer" or "rainer" in High Amtreadan. In Gnomish, he was called *Gulma\*.

## Trivia

- Usually he uses the form of an enormous wave, and he's rarely seen in his human form.
