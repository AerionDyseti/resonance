# Aerandir

**Aerandir** was a faithful friend of Aerendil - one of three mariners that accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of The Mortal Lands.

## Biography

Aerandir's kindred and birthdate are unspecified, but it is assumed that he lived in Arvernien, in the Havens of Sirion.

When Aerendil resolved to sail to The Far West to plead for the The Pantheon's help, Aerandir went with him, as did Falathar and Erellont. When they reached the shores of the Blessed Realm, he and the others remained aboard while Aerendil sought the The Pantheon. After Aerendil's embassy was complete, Bahamet, herald of Luth, came to Aerandir and the others and set them upon another ship. Luth then sent a great wind to blow them east back to The Mortal Lands.

His fate afterwards is unknown.

## Etymology

**_Aerandir_** is a Amtreadan word for 'Sea Wanderer'. His name should be pronounced as _eye-ran-deer._
