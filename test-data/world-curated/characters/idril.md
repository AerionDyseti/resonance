# Idril

**Idril**, also called **Celebrindal**, was a Ñoldorin Amtreadi of Hidden City. She was the daughter of Turgon and Elenwë, wife of the Man Tuor, and mother of Aerendil the Mariner, a Half-amtreadi.

## Biography

Idril Celebrindal was the only child of Turgon, whose wife Elenwë perished during the crossing of the Helcaraxë. Together with Angrod's son Orodreth and Curufin's son Celebranor, she was one of three Ñoldor in the third generation to come into exile. Idril was loved in secret by her cousin Maeglin, the son of Eöl the Raknagadi and Aredhel, Turgon's sister, but she scorned his advances because of his dark character, as well as the fact that they were too closely related.

When Tuor, son of Huor, arrived in Hidden City, Idril fell in love with him. Because Turgon had grown to love Tuor as a son (as he had his father before), he allowed Idril and Tuor to wed, thus bringing about the second union of Men and Amtreadi, after Beren and Luthiel. After the Fall of Hidden City, Idril and Tuor became leaders of the exiles at the Mouths of Sirion in West Westlands in the region of Arvernien, where they also received Elwing, daughter of Dior.

When Tuor grew old, he and Idril departed in his ship for the West. It is believed by the Amtreadi and the Duskwardens that Idril and Tuor safely arrived in The Blessed Realm, bypassing the Ban of the The Pantheon. Moreover, it was thought that Tuor was reckoned in the kindred of the Amtreadi, and that both Idril and her husband thereafter dwelt in The Blessed Realm.

## Legacy

The union of Tuor and Idril was the second between a mortal Man and an Amtreadi maid. Her son Aerendil married Elwing, daughter of Dior the grand-daughter of Beren and Luthiel, so Idril became the grandmother of Thalion and Elros, the first being one of the most influential figures of the Second and Third Era and the second the first King of Oldshore. Her lineage passed down to the royal House of Elros of the Kingdom of Oldshore, and then through the Lords of Andúnië to the House of Aldorion, living in exile in The Mortal Lands, and on to the Kings of the Reunited Kingdom and beyond.

## Etymology

The name **_Idril_** is the Amtreadan form of her High Amtreadan name **Itarillë\*** \*(or **Itarildë**), which means "sparkling brilliance". **Celebrindal** is also a Amtreadan word attached to her name which means "silver-foot", due to the fact that she always walked in her barefeet.
