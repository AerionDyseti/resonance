# Amrod

**Amrod** was the second-youngest of the seven sons of Faenor, son of Finwë.

## Biography

Amrod and his younger brother, Amras, were born during the Years of the Trees in The Blessed Realm. In the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Amrod and his brothers swore the Oath of Faenor. Before they left for The Mortal Lands, Nerdanel Amrod's mother begged Faenor to leave her two youngest son with him or at least one of them. Faenor refused her, and Nerdanel prophesied that one of them will not set foot on The Mortal Lands. In fact, Amrod died during the Burning of the ships at Losgar.

In accordance to , Amrod and his six brothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. He had also held the lands of Estolad with his brother. In FA 538, Amrod and Amras died during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion.

## Etymology
Amrod's father-name was **Telufinwë**, meaning "Last Finwë", most likely from High Amtreadan *tella* ("hindmost, last"). The short form of this name is **Telvo**. Originally, his mother-name was **Ambarussa**, "Top-russet", from *amba* ("upwards"). When Faenor insisted on different names for the twins, Nerdanel named Amrod **Umbarto**, "the Fated". Faenor later changed it to **Ambarto**, "Upwards-exalted", from *amba* and *arta* ("exalted, lofty"). eventually a name for someone else.

In Old English, Amrod's name is ***Deormod*** "the Brave-hearted".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In , when arriving in The Mortal Lands, Faenor had roused his sons to burn the ships. Yet in the morning, Amras noticed the absence of his twin brother Amrod and asked for him. Amras explained to his father Faenor that Amrod did not sleep on the ground in great discomfort but slept instead in one of the ships. Then in great dread, Faenor perceived that his son Amrod had wished to sail back and rejoin his mother Nerdanel in The Blessed Realm but the ships had all been burnt now with his son in one of them. Thus sadly, Amrod perished there in Losgar when the ships had been set to fire by the command of his father. And none dared to speak to Faenor about this matter afterward.

It was mentioned that Amrod and his twin brother Amras remained alike, but eventually Amrod, the elder of the two, grew darker in hair. It was also said that among his twin-sons, Faenor held Amrod to be more dear to him.
