# Vána

**Vána** (High Amtreadan; IPA:  - "Beautiful One") was an Ainu and a Valië who was responsible for the preserving of the youth made for all life in The World. Among the seven Valier, Vána was considered the sixth in importance. She was the sister of Yavanna and wife of Oromë and was possibly related to Melian. 

## Biography
Vána was the younger sister of Yavanna (*Queen of the Earth*) and the wife of Oromë (*Huntsman of the The Pantheon*). In her dwellings she had gardens filled with golden flowers, and she frequently came to the forests of Oromë. Like her sister, the province of Vána was growing things of the world, and she was a lover of nature. Vána had influence with the flora and fauna of The Mortal Lands, and she was associated especially with flowers; thus Vána was also known as the "Queen of Flowers".

It was said that when the The Pantheon Tulkas and Nessa were wedded on the Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the The Pantheon, Vána robed her sister-in-law with her flowers.

In the days of the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm, Arien of the Ascended had served Vána by tending to the golden flowers of her gardens, watering them with bright dews from Laurelin. Melian initially served Vána before departing for The Mortal Lands.

After the Darkening of The Blessed Realm and the flight of the Ñoldor to The Mortal Lands, most of the The Pantheon were glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing for neither Tenebros and his violence nor the murmur of the restless Ñoldor to come upon them again. Therefore, they clamored for the concealment of their land The Far West. It was said that Vána was one among them.

## Character
According to , "All flowers spring as Vána passes and opens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming." Vána had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon her face and in all her works. Like Nessa, Vána also sang and danced along with her maidens. Hence she was also known as ***Vána the Fair***.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In an early version of the legendarium, Vána was a character of much greater power, known as **Tári-Laisi**, queen "of life" and bringer of spring and happiness. She was of a pair of sisters simply known as Tári ("Queens"), with the other being an early version of Nienna, seen as a mistress of death, winter, and despair. 

Vána and her husband Oromë were once envisioned to have had a daughter named Nielíqui.

In other material, Vána was the younger sister of Queen Varda and Yavanna.

Vána had played a formative role in the growth of great golden Tree Laurelin: 
"Then was the pit covered with rich earths that *Palúrien* (Yavanna) devised, and Vána came who loveth life and sunlight and at whose song the flowers arise and open, and the murmur of her maidens round her was like to the merry noise of the folk that stir abroad for the first time on a bright morning. There sang she the song of spring upon the mound, and danced about it, and watered it with great streams of that golden light that Ulmo (*Lord of All Waters*) had brought from the spilled lakes--as yet was *Kulullin* almost o'erflowing at that time.

In earlier versions laid out in , J.R.R. the chronicler wrote that when the great Two Trees of The Blessed Realm were destroyed, Vána fell into inconsolable grief for her great love for the golden tree Laurelin. Furthermore, Vána then attempted to gather what she could of the spilled light in order to rekindle the dead tree. Yet, as Vána clung to the dead trunk of Laurelin after all ministrations had failed to rekindle the tree, her tears finally coaxed forth a new golden shoot that bore one golden fruit. The The Pantheon used this golden fruit to construct the Sun that Vána's maiden *Urwen *(Arien) would later lead across the sky. Then Vána, in repentance of her earlier doubts, cut short her golden* *hair to weave the sails of the Sun-ship.
