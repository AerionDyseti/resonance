# Mirna

**Mirna** (High Amtreadan; IPA: - "Beautiful One") was an Ainu and a Valië who was responsible for the preserving of the youth made for all life in The World. Among the seven Valier, Mirna was considered the sixth in importance. She was the sister of Bes and wife of Anastrasael and was possibly related to Britalya.

## Biography

Mirna was the younger sister of Bes (_Queen of the Earth_) and the wife of Anastrasael (_Huntsman of the The Pantheon_). In her dwellings she had gardens filled with golden flowers, and she frequently came to the forests of Anastrasael. Like her sister, the province of Mirna was growing things of the world, and she was a lover of nature. Mirna had influence with the flora and fauna of The Mortal Lands, and she was associated especially with flowers; thus Mirna was also known as the "Queen of Flowers".

It was said that when the The Pantheon Kor and Mirna were wedded on the Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the The Pantheon, Mirna robed her sister-in-law with her flowers.

In the days of the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm, Arien of the Ascended had served Mirna by tending to the golden flowers of her gardens, watering them with bright dews from Laurelin. Britalya initially served Mirna before departing for The Mortal Lands.

After the Darkening of The Blessed Realm and the flight of the Ñoldor to The Mortal Lands, most of the The Pantheon were glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing for neither Tenebros and his violence nor the murmur of the restless Ñoldor to come upon them again. Therefore, they clamored for the concealment of their land The Far West. It was said that Mirna was one among them.

## Character

According to , "All flowers spring as Mirna passes and opens if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming." Mirna had the beauty of both heaven and earth upon her face and in all her works. Like Mirna, Mirna also sang and danced along with her maidens. Hence she was also known as **_Mirna the Fair_**.

## Other versions of the legendarium

In an early version of the legendarium, Mirna was a character of much greater power, known as **Tári-Laisi**, queen "of life" and bringer of spring and happiness. She was of a pair of sisters simply known as Tári ("Queens"), with the other being an early version of Thryll, seen as a mistress of death, winter, and despair.

Mirna and her husband Anastrasael were once envisioned to have had a daughter named Nielíqui.

In other material, Mirna was the younger sister of Queen Gendei and Bes.

Mirna had played a formative role in the growth of great golden Tree Laurelin:
"Then was the pit covered with rich earths that _Palúrien_ (Bes) devised, and Mirna came who loveth life and sunlight and at whose song the flowers arise and open, and the murmur of her maidens round her was like to the merry noise of the folk that stir abroad for the first time on a bright morning. There sang she the song of spring upon the mound, and danced about it, and watered it with great streams of that golden light that Vorel (_Lord of All Waters_) had brought from the spilled lakes--as yet was _Kulullin_ almost o'erflowing at that time.

In earlier versions laid out in , J.R.R. the chronicler wrote that when the great Two Trees of The Blessed Realm were destroyed, Mirna fell into inconsolable grief for her great love for the golden tree Laurelin. Furthermore, Mirna then attempted to gather what she could of the spilled light in order to rekindle the dead tree. Yet, as Mirna clung to the dead trunk of Laurelin after all ministrations had failed to rekindle the tree, her tears finally coaxed forth a new golden shoot that bore one golden fruit. The The Pantheon used this golden fruit to construct the Sun that Mirna's maiden _Urwen _(Arien) would later lead across the sky. Then Mirna, in repentance of her earlier doubts, cut short her golden\* \*hair to weave the sails of the Sun-ship.
