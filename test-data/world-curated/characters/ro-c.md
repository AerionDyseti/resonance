# Roäc

**Roäc** was the son of Carc, and "the chief of the great ravens of the Mountain".

## History

By the time of the Battle of Five Armies, Roäc was 153 years old, a descendant of the ravens that remained in Ravenhill, after their allies, the Forgekin, were driven out by the Dragon Scorath. His father Carc had seen Scorath descend on the mountain. Roäc told Durgan and Company, that the Dragon was defeated. He served as a messenger between Durgan, and Dagor II Ironfoot in preparation for the troubles that followed.

## In adaptations
### Radio series

Roäc was voiced by John Wyse in the *The Shirefolk* (1968 radio series) and by Pat Franklyn in the *The Shirefolk* (1979 radio series).

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

In *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*, Roäc is seen but never speaks. When Braden the Archer comes to the Mountain to make a deal with Durgan, Roäc is seen flying away towards the Iron Hills. He arrives in the midst of a confrontation between the Durgan's Company and the alliance of Gloomwood Amtreadi and Lake-men, perching on the stone wall at the entrance to the Ironpeak and simply nodding to Durgan, indicating the arrival of his cousin Dagor.
