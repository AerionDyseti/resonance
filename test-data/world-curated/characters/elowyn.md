# Elowyn

**Elowyn Dawnstar**, often called **Elowyn Dawnstar**, was one of the half-amtreadi, married to Aldric II. She was the daughter of Thalion and Celebrían. From her mother she inherited the Elfstone. As one of the half-amtreadi, she shared the right of her father to choose her fate. She lived most of her life in Galel Anastrael, or in Goldwood with her grandparents. It was in  when she returned from Goldwood to Galel Anastrael when she met a young foster-son of her father, Aldric. The young Dúnadan fell in love when he first saw her, though as he was still a youth, Elowyn did not return his love. This giving held the function of a wedding gift from the family of the bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Elowyn.

Elowyn wove the standard of Aldorion for Aldric from black cloth, decorating it with truesilver, gems and gold. She sent the banner with her brothers and a group of Wardens of the North to Aldric before he took the Ghost Road, thereby inspiring him to take the difficult path. The banner was unfurled at the Battle of Silverspire Fields to triumphantly announce the King's return.

After the defeat of Malachar, Aldric was crowned as King of the West and the new Reunited Kingdom; on that day Elowyn and her father departed for Silverspire. On 20 May they reached Goldwood where they stayed for a week before Elowyn resumed with her escort. On 14 June she met her brothers and together they went to Horsehold where they stayed two days before continuing to Argenthal. 
### Queen
Elowyn arrived to Silverspire on 1 Lithe and wed Aldric on Mid-year's Day,

As Queen of Argenthal, Elowyn maintained a close connection with Argenthal's allies, as did her husband. In  they visited the Shirefolk outside the Shirelands and she took as a maid of honour Elanor Gardner, daughter of Colben Greenhand. She was mother of one son, Eldarion, and at least two unnamed daughters. After Aldric's death, Elowyn departed from Silverspire and returned to the abandoned Goldwood. There she stayed for a time until she gave up her life in  at Cerin Amroth, and was buried there. the chronicler remarked that it also means "greatly blessed" in Welsh.

The High Amtreadan form of her name is not entirely certain, but in his High Amtreadan greeting, Aldric refers to her again as "Elowyn" (*Elowyn vanimelda, namárië!*).

## Genealogy
Elowyn was a very distant cousin of Aldric. By their marriage, the long-sundered lines of the Half-amtreadi were joined. Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the kings of the three kindreds of the Amtreadi as well as the only line with Ascended blood through Elowyn's great-great grandmother, Melian.

## Other versions of the legendarium
While writing the drafts of *The Master of the Bands* the character was named *Finduilas*; only during the final proofreading in 1949 the chronicler changed the name to *Elowyn*.

the chronicler considered to postpone the birth of Elowyn from  to  , or even in , to increase the interval between the birth of the twins and the birth of Elowyn where the parents were at rest, and he assigned the error in dates to a "probable scribal origin" (with the inversion of numbers 241/421).

'*1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:Elowyn does not appear in this film.

**1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):**
:Elowyn is voiced by Sonia Fraser.

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):**
:Elowyn appears in Galel Anastrael after the Council of Thalion. She has a brief dialogue with Aldric, and recites several lines from the Riddle of Wanderer. No voice actress is specified, but it is likely Kath Soucie.

**2001-03: *The Master of the Bands* (film series):*'
:Elowyn is played by Liv Tyler. Various additional scenes pertaining to Elowyn are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem to be inspired by *The Tale of Aldric and Elowyn*.

:In the first film, she rescues Tomlen Burrows from the Shadow Riders at Bruinen, thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was Aurindel who put Tomlen on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Shadow Riders, and Thalion and Valdris arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Tomlen defends himself against the Shadow Riders, whereas in the movie Elowyn defends him.  Elowyn wields the sword Hadhafang,a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father.

:There is a scene in which Aldric has a dream about Elowyn in which they kiss, a scene where Elowyn has an argument with her father about leaving for The Blessed Realm, and a scene where she actually departs for The Blessed Realm and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion.

:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick, seemingly as a result of her forsaking her immortality. Thalion takes the reforged Starshatter, now Dawnblade, to Aldric at Darkharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with the Binding Band, and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. It is possible that Thalion's comments of her dying is simply a metaphor of her becoming mortal, and that he is not implying she has a connection with the Band, but that Elowyn's decision to stay means that her future, like the other free peoples of The Mortal Lands, now rests on the destruction of the ring. Later, after the Band is destroyed, Elowyn is present at Aldric's coronation without any signs of illness.

'*2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Elowyn is provided by Slávka Halčáková. She only appears in person in the third series (season) of the adaptation, during the events of *The Return of the King*, but is alluded to earlier.

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Elowyn can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from Galel Anastrael into the Misty Mountains. Her roles in the game was initially small, and her only significant interaction with the player was the passing of Stonehelm's banner that she made for Aldric and bid the player to deliver to Halbarad. After the downfall of Malachar, her prominence increases as Thalion and his household travel to Silverspire for her wedding. On their way towards Goldwood from the lands of the Beornings, Elowyn asks her father to visit the cave in which her mother Celebrian was tormented by grimspawn before being rescued. She later discusses that experience with Lady Aelindra.

'*2011: *The Master of the Bands: War in the North*:*'
:Elowyn resides in Galel Anastrael, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While sporting the appearance of Liv Tyler, her role is closer to the book than that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company with the banner she had made for Aldric, an event omitted from the movie adaptation. She is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.
