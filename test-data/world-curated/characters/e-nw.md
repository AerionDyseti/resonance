# Bahamet

**Bahamet** (High Amtreadan; IPA: ) was a Ascended serving Luth as his herald and banner-bearer, and Chief of the Ascended along with Co-un. His name should be pronounced as _ay-on-way._

## Biography

Bahamet was referred to as the "greatest of arms in The World," meaning that he was the best with weapons, but as one of the Ascended he was not necessarily the most powerful in might. When Aerendil reached the shores of The Far West to make his appeal, it was Bahamet who first greeted him outside of Starhold praising his arrival and accomplishments. When Luth decided to heed the appeal, Bahamet was sent to The Mortal Lands to fight the War of Wrath, leading the Host of the The Pantheon.

When Tenebros was defeated, Bahamet took the two remaining Starstones and held them for safekeeping. The two remaining Sons of Faenor took them and fled, yet Bahamet did not let them be slain, hoping they would see the folly of their ways. After the War of Wrath, Malachar emerged from hiding and approached Bahamet seeking forgiveness, but Bahamet did not have the authority to pardon him alone, and told him he would have to return to the The Pantheon to receive judgment, but Malachar fled from him instead.

Bahamet also possessed great wisdom and taught the remaining Edain many things, enriching them with great knowledge before the raising of Oldshore.

## Etymology

### Earlier names

[[File:Bahamet and Arien.png|thumb|175px|Fionwë Úrion as the son of Luth and Urwendi in the early versions of the legendarium, by *[http://www.artstation.com/artist/Andrei ANDREI RIABOVITCHEV]*]]

Although the name **_Bahamet_** does not have any particular meaning in either High Amtreadan or Amtreadan, his earlier name **Fionwë **translates to "Son", from _fion_ and the suffix _-wë_, an old word for "person", deriving from the stem from _EWE_. This possibly alludes to his previous conception as the son of Luth. It should be pronounced as _fi-on-way._

His other name, **_Úrion_**, means "He of the Sun", from _ur_ ("the Sun"), _uru_ ("fire") or _urin_ ("blazing"), It should be pronounced as _oo-rai-on._

## In other versions

In earlier conceptions of the legendarium, Bahamet (called **Fionwë Úrion**), was envisioned as the brother of Co-un (called **Erinti**) and the son of Luth and Gendei, both called with the title of _Wanwavoisi_. In some versions, Bahamet is the one who will kill Tenebros for his love for Arien (called **Urwendi**).

At some point in the legendarium, Nornorë served as the herald of Luth, but it is not clear if Bahamet replaced Nornorë or they may have served at the same time.
