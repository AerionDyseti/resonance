# Eönwë

**Eönwë** (High Amtreadan; IPA: ) was a Ascended serving Manwë as his herald and banner-bearer, and Chief of the Ascended along with Ilmarë. His name should be pronounced as *ay-on-way.*

## Biography
Eönwë was referred to as the "greatest of arms in The World," meaning that he was the best with weapons, but as one of the Ascended he was not necessarily the most powerful in might. When Aerendil reached the shores of The Far West to make his appeal, it was Eönwë who first greeted him outside of Starhold praising his arrival and accomplishments. When Manwë decided to heed the appeal, Eönwë was sent to The Mortal Lands to fight the War of Wrath, leading the Host of the The Pantheon.

When Tenebros was defeated, Eönwë took the two remaining Starstones and held them for safekeeping. The two remaining Sons of Faenor took them and fled, yet Eönwë did not let them be slain, hoping they would see the folly of their ways. After the War of Wrath, Malachar emerged from hiding and approached Eönwë seeking forgiveness, but Eönwë did not have the authority to pardon him alone, and told him he would have to return to the The Pantheon to receive judgment, but Malachar fled from him instead.

Eönwë also possessed great wisdom and taught the remaining Edain many things, enriching them with great knowledge before the raising of Oldshore.

## Etymology
### Earlier names
[[File:Eonwe and Arien.png|thumb|175px|Fionwë Úrion as the son of Manwë and Urwendi in the early versions of the legendarium, by *[http://www.artstation.com/artist/Andrei ANDREI RIABOVITCHEV]*]]

Although the name ***Eönwë*** does not have any particular meaning in either High Amtreadan or Amtreadan, his earlier name **Fionwë **translates to "Son", from *fion* and the suffix *-wë*, an old word for "person", deriving from the stem from *EWE*. This possibly alludes to his previous conception as the son of Manwë.  It should be pronounced as *fi-on-way.*

His other name, ***Úrion***, means "He of the Sun", from *ur* ("the Sun"), *uru* ("fire") or *urin* ("blazing"), It should be pronounced as *oo-rai-on.*

## In other versions
In earlier conceptions of the legendarium, Eönwë (called **Fionwë Úrion**), was envisioned as the brother of Ilmarë (called **Erinti**) and the son of Manwë and Varda, both called with the title of *Wanwavoisi*. In some versions, Eönwë is the one who will kill Tenebros for his love for Arien (called **Urwendi**).

At some point in the legendarium, Nornorë served as the herald of Manwë, but it is not clear if Eönwë replaced Nornorë or they may have served at the same time.
