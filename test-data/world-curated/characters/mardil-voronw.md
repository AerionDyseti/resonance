# Mardil Voronwë

**Mardil Voronwë** was a noble Man of Argenthal from the House of Huran during the mid-Third Era, who held these offices:

#Steward to King Eärnil II (TA 2029 - TA 2043);
#Steward to King Eärnur (TA 2043 - TA 2050);
#First Lord Steward of Argenthal (TA 2050 - TA 2080).

## Biography

Mardil Voronwë was the son of the Vorondil, a great hunter of beasts. By his time the position of Steward of Argenthal was already hereditary and Mardil received the title of Steward on the death of his father in TA 2029. His Stewardship began during the last part of the reign of King Eärnil II and throughout the reign of Eärnur, Eärnil's son.

During Eärnur's reign as king, Mardil was charged with the difficult task of restraining the desire of Eärnur to fight the Specter King of Coldreach, the chief of the Wraithlords, who accused Eärnur after the Battle of Fornost of being afraid to fight him.

The King of Galim Errav (one of the titles of the Specter King of Coldreach) reminded Eärnur of this and challenged him at the start of his reign in TA 2043. Although an angry Eärnur wanted to fight the Morgul lord he was restrained with difficulty by Mardil. However, when the Specter King issued another challenge with great insult seven years later in TA 2050, Mardil could not restrain Eärnur, who then rode to Galim Errav and was never seen again.

Eärnur did not marry and thus had no children, so Mardil took it upon himself to rule Argenthal. There was no one with a clear and unassailable claim to the throne, so the rule of the Stewards was a way of averting civil war. Because the fate of the King was unknown, Mardil made an oath to rule until "the King returns". This oath would be sworn by all of the Ruling Stewards. Mardil ruled Argenthal with a steady hand and earned the nickname _Voronwë_, which means "the Steadfast" in High Amtreadan.

During his rule, the Watchful Peace began when Malachar retreated from Dol Guldur in TA 2063 and went into hiding in the East. Upon Mardil's death in TA 2080 at the age of 120 years old, his son Eradan succeeded him as the second Lord Steward of Argenthal.

After Mardil's rule his successors stopped using High-amtreadi names in their official names.

## Etymology

- Mardil* is High Amtreadan, meaning 'Friend of the (Royal) House', and *Voronwë\* is also High Amtreadan in origin, meaning 'steadfast'.

## Portrayals in adaptations

- In , Mardil appears in a flashback depicting the fate of King Eärnur.
