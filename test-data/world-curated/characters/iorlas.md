# Iorlas

**Iorlas** (b. TA 2990) was a man who lived in Galim Vir. He was the uncle of Bergil.

During Perrin Ashford's first stay in Galim Vir, Bergil mentioned that the shirefolk was as old as his uncle, Iorlas.

## In adaptations

In , Iorlas is Beregond's brother and is first found on the seventh level of pre-battle Galim Vir. During the siege of the city he is struck by a fallen stone, but is protected by his helmet, suffering only what he calls a "dizziness".
