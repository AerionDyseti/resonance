## Campaign History (Sessions 1–10)

### The Case of the Missing Falcon (Sessions 1–2)

Zuleia participated in the discreet recovery of the gyr falcon Iri, helping navigate social protocols in the Cultivators District.

### The Tainted Water Investigation (Sessions 3–10)

Zuleia's scholarly background proved essential throughout the investigation:

- Session 3: Prepared healing infusions distributed during the dungeon exploration
- Session 6: Her infusions were used during the grotto investigation

**Religious Knowledge (Session 10)**: When the party discovered the cursed black spear, Zuleia's religion check (rolled 35) revealed the three options: destroy the spear (releasing its energy unpredictably), take it for purification at the Temple of Light, or attempt to wield its terrible power. She noted that items of great power forming minds and overriding wielders' wills is considered myth—but the spear demonstrated it was real.

During combat:

- Session 9-10: Afflicted by supernatural fear from a siphon surge, forcing her to flee toward the exit
- Session 10: Despite the fear effect, she successfully **disarmed the possessed Zeribella**, knocking the cursed spear free and saving her ally

### Items Acquired

- Ring of Protection +1 (inscribed with ancient draconic runes, from dragonborn devotee in the grotto) — Session 6

### Session 11: Theory Meets Practice

**Sister Revealed**: The party learned that Zuleia is **Sabrina's younger sister**—a fact previously unknown to the group. Sabrina noted that Zuleia "carries not just the weight of her own expectations, she carries the ones set for me too."

**Scholar's Reflection**: Around the campfire, Zuleia reflected on the gap between academic knowledge and lived experience: "I can tell you facts and figures and dates for about all of this stuff. But I guess it was all kind of theoretical." The Darkness Wars, which she knew as dates and documents, now feel different after touching artifacts from that era and fighting something *from* that era.

**Career Considerations**: The experience has Zuleia considering a more hands-on career direction—possibly archaeology or field work within the Scholar caste, rather than pure archival study.

**Giant Writing Translation**: Zuleia used a Comprehend Languages extract to translate the rubbings from the cistern. Her Linguistics check (aided by the spell) revealed:

*"Harmonic Research Station Seven. Here we study the voice of creation—sound born from the union of opposing forces. Research focus: resonance applications in shaping, sealing, and defense. Attend the pillars. Harmony is fragile. Imbalanced frequencies cause structural failure and tissue damage."*

Her Knowledge (Arcana) check (34) revealed this wasn't just Giant technology—it was *novel* Giant research into sonic magic. The pillars were powered by combining positive and negative energy, a known Giant technique, but the application to sound-based magic was groundbreaking. She stayed up late writing notes, recognizing this as "an entire PhD thesis by itself."

**Family**: Has younger brothers (ages approximately 12 and 15).

*Session Quote: "One thing at a time. Check the next thing off the list."*
