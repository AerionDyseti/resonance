## Background

At first glance, al-Atar appears to be nothing more than Queen Aliyah's favored companion and courtesan in the court of Lux. This carefully cultivated image, which draws both admiration and whispers, serves as the perfect cover for his true role as Solaarus's premier spymaster. 

As head of the secretive Tenth Caste, an intelligence organization operating outside the traditional nine castes of Solaaran society, he wields considerable influence while maintaining the appearance of political irrelevance. His position in the Queen's inner circle provides ideal opportunities for gathering intelligence, as others often speak freely around someone they perceive as merely a pleasure-servant.

The Tenth Caste's intelligence network spans all levels of society, from noble diplomats to the lowest-caste caregivers. Under al-Atar's leadership, this sophisticated web of surveillance has grown even more extensive while remaining virtually invisible. His operatives, disguised as servants, courtesans, and minor officials, monitor potential threats to the regime, religious dissent, and foreign interference.

Perhaps most crucially, al-Atar serves as a discreet liaison between the three remaining Dragonmarked and the Solaaran leadership, carefully maintaining the delicate balance of power between these mystically-empowered individuals and the theocratic government.

## Personality

Al-Atar presents himself as charming, sophisticated, and politically neutral. He is known for his quick wit and disarming manner, using these traits to put others at ease while gathering information. Despite his outward warmth, he maintains careful emotional distance from others, treating relationships as tools to be wielded rather than genuine connections.

He demonstrates remarkable patience and calculation in his operations, preferring to gather information thoroughly before acting. His true thoughts and feelings remain carefully guarded, hidden behind layers of practiced social grace.

## Appearance

Tall and graceful, al-Atar cuts an elegant figure in the court of Lux. His movements are measured and precise, reflecting years of courtly training.

### Notable Characteristics

- Tall and lean build, moving with practiced grace
- Immaculately groomed appearance with perfectly tailored clothing
- Subtle jewelry that denotes his status while avoiding ostentation
- Carries himself with an air of refined dignity

## Relationships
