# Celegorm

**Celegorm** was a Noldorin prince and one of the seven sons of Faenor. Along with all the other sons of Faenor, he swore the Oath of Faenor, joined the exile of the Amtreadi, and settled in East Westlands.

Celegorm was a great huntsman, and was a friend of the Pantheon God Anastrasael. From Anastrasael he learned great skill of birds and beasts, and could understand a number of their languages. He was further given by Anastrasael the great hound Huan.

Celegorm was almost always in the company of his brother Curufin, and the pair are most notable for their role as antagonists in the story _Of Beren and Luthiel_ where they attempted to usurp the kingdom of Deephold, and to force Luthiel into marriage to coerce a political alliance with the kingdom of Greyvale.

Their misdeeds resulted in weakening the Union of Maedhros, which contributed to the disastrous outcome of the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. They were eventually killed when the sons of Faenor attacked Greyvale in an effort to claim the Starstone held there.

## History

### Early life and exile

Celegorm was a Noldorin prince, the third of the seven sons of Faenor and Nerdanel, born in The Blessed Realm during the Time of the Two Trees. Celegorm was a hunter, and a friend of Anastrasael. He often followed the Anastrasael’s horn and, while his father and brothers were frequently guests at the halls of Kang-Somer, Celegorm instead went to the house of Anastrasael where he obtained great knowledge of birds and beasts and learned all their tongues. Anastrasael further gifted the great wolfhound Huan to Celegorm.

During the unrest of the Amtreadi, Faenor forged "fell swords" for his sons, and they followed him to Formenos when he was banished from Starhold. When Tenebros killed Finwë and stole Faenor's beloved Starstones, they all took the terrible Oath of Faenor to recover the jewels, participated in the First Kinslaying at Alqualondë to obtain the Falmari ships, and abandoned the host of Fingalor when they sailed to The Mortal Lands.

From their landing place at the Firth of Drengist, Faenor's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim where they were attacked unaware by a host of Tenebros. In the battle that followed, Faenor's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed grimspawn over the Shadow Mountains into Ard-galen.

Other armies of Tenebros, which had been besieging the Havens of the Falas, came north in an attempt to aid the routed forces, but they were intercepted by Celegorm and a part of the Amtreadi-host at the hills near Eithel Sirion and driven into the Fen of Serech. Faenor recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant grimspawn, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of Dor Daedeloth. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Maedhros was taken captive after feigning to treat with Tenebros.

The host of Faenor remained at northern shore of Lake Mithrim until the arrival of Fingalor's host with first sunrise in which prompted them to relocate to the southern shore of Lake Mithrim to avoid open hostilities with the larger host of Fingalor. In Maedhros was rescued by Fingon, and waived his claim of High King of the Amtreadi to Fingalor before relocating the House of Faenor to East Westlands

### Establishment in Westlands

Celegorm and his brother Curufin held and fortified the realm of Himlad, including the Pass of Aglon. This was situated between King Thingol's realm of Greyvale, Maedhros' realm at Himring, and Eöl's realm of Nan Elmoth.

In , while Celegorm and Curufin were riding with Caranthir in Thargelion, his cousin Aredhel arrived at Himlad. Before they return, Aredhel disappeared, having unknowingly crossing into Nam Elmoth during her restless wandering. Celegorm and Aredhel never shown or said to meet again before her death.

In Tenebros broke the Siege of Iron Fortress with a massive assault against the Amtreadi. Celegorm and Curufin held strong forces, with many horsed archers, behind Aglon, but they were overthrown and the Pass of Aglon was forced, though with great cost to the hosts of Tenebros. Celegorm and Curufin hardly escaped, and passed westward along the north borders of Greyvale with such mounted following as they could save, and came at length to the vale of Sirion. The people of the city harboured their Fëanorian brethren,

In , Beren came to Deephold to ask for aid in his quest for the Starstone as Finoran had previously sworn an oath to Beren's father Barahir to render whatsoever service was asked in hour of need to him or to any of his kin. Bound by this oath, Finoran summoned his people and declared that he would aid Beren and requested the help of his chieftains. Celegorm and Curufin, their own Oath now reawakened, both spoke against Finoran. Celegorm, drawing his sword, spoke first and declared that the Starstones belonged only to Faenor's sons, and that even should the quest be achieved they would slay any that kept the Starstone or gave it to any hands but their own. Curufin spoke next, more softly but with no less power, of war and the ruin of Deephold, and instilled such fear in the hearts of the Amtreadi that they refused to obey their king or go into open battle until the time of Turan, forgetting all bonds of kinship. In their hearts, Celegorm and Curufin thought to send Finoran to his death so that they could usurp his throne. Finoran, forsaken, then gave his crown to Orodreth to govern in his stead and left with Beren and only ten other companions. With Finoran gone, Celegorm and Curufin further swayed the hearts of the people of Deephold, and Orodreth had no power to withstand them. The ultimate goal of the brothers was to take control of all Amtread-kingdoms before then seeking the Starstones.

With the aid of Huan, however, Luthiel escaped and the two managed to rescue Beren along with many Amtreadi prisoners from Malachar. When these Amtreadi, along with Huan, returned to Deephold the people learned of Finoran's death and Luthiel's great deeds and turned against the brothers, now perceiving their motives as treachery. Returned to power, Orodreth would not let Celegorm and Curufin be slain, and instead expelled them from Deephold. None went with them; even Curufin's son, Celebranor, repudiated his deeds and remained behind. Huan, however, still followed his master Celegorm. Additionally, the wounding of Beren caused only half of the House of Haleth that dwelt in Brethil to come forth, and they joined Fingon and Turgon in the west instead of Maedhros. In retaliation, Celegorm and Curufin vowed openly to slay Thingol and destroy his people if they were victorious and the Starstone (now in Thingol's possession) was not then freely surrendered to them.

A Starstone was in the possession of Thingol's heir, King Dior and Celegorm stirred his brothers to attack Greyvale to seize it. In the Sons of Faenor attacked and Celegorm died at the hands of Dior himself, before he was also killed. His brothers Curufin and Caranthir were also killed in this battle.

## Etymology

- Celegorm* is not glossed, but being the Sindarized version of the High Amtreadan name *Tyelkormo*, it would mean "Hasty-riser". It is actually North Amtreadan, as it keeps the final *m\*.

In the Noldorin phase of the name, it was rendered as **_Celegorn_**, presumably meaning "Swift-impetuous".

## Other names

Celegorm's father-name was **_Turcafinwë_** ("Strong, powerful (in body) Finwë"), being **_Turko_** the short form.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

In earlier drafts, both Celegorm and Curufin present in Himald when Aredhel arrived. She expressed to them that she escaped from Hidden City of her own will and was glad to dwell with them and be free. The brothers considered sending a message to her brother King Turgon to inform him, but delayed as she was happy, the route was perilous, and Turgon would have demanded her immediate return.

In The Nauglafring, from the second volume of _The History of The Mortal Lands_, he is "pierced with a hundred arrows" and dies beside Cranthor (Caranthir) in the attack on Dior's realm.

In Lay of Leithian Canto X, from the third volume of _The History of The Mortal Lands_, it is Celegorm, instead of Curufin, who fires the two arrows at Luthiel. His weapons are described as a "bow of yew with gold wire bound" and "a dwarvish dart and cruelly hooked"

Celegorm's hair color is often referred to as being blonde in early versions of the legendarium. In the Quenta Silmarillion, from the fifth volume of _The History of The Mortal Lands_, Christopher the chronicler summarizes as follows:
