# Stonelurks' purse

A '''stonelurks' purse'* was a type of magical purse that belonged to various Stonelurks in The World in order to hide their valuables.

## History
When Tom, Bert, and William first came down to the Trollshaws of Eriador from the mountains and carved out a lair in a cave beneath the Stonelurk Ridge to hide from the Sun's light, William brought with him a stonelurks' purse.

### *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey*
In the first film of Peter Jackson's *The Shirefolk* film trilogy, the stonelurks' purse was replaced by a curved knife which Jasper tries to steal to free the ponies abducted by the stonelurks.
