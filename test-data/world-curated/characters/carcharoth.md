# Carcharoth

**Carcharoth** was bred from the foul breed of Draugluin, the first Werewolf, and fed with amtreadan and mannish flesh by Tenebros himself. He was the greatest, most powerful wolf to ever live. Carcharoth was set as a guard on the Gates of Iron Fortress, and later he mortally wounded both Huan, the Hound of The Blessed Realm, and Beren.

## History
After hearing of the Fall of Tol-in-Gaurhoth, where Huan had defeated Draugluin and Malachar, Tenebros decided to create a werewolf to kill Huan, who could only be killed by the greatest wolf to have ever lived. Carcharoth became involved with the Quest for the Starstone when Beren and Luthiel had to pass him on their way into Iron Fortress. He stopped them, suspicious of Draugluin, (Beren in disguise) as he had heard of Draugluin's death. Luthiel enchanted him with her magic, but on their way out Carcharoth attacked before Luthiel could enchant him again. Beren held out the captured Starstone in an attempt to stay the beast, but Carcharoth bit off Beren's hand at the wrist with Starstone and all.

The Starstone burnt away Carcharoth's insides, and he became crazed with pain. A terror to Eldar, Men and Grimspawn alike, he passed south through Westlands, consumed with an overpowering thirst. From this comes his name of **Anfauglir**, meaning 'Jaws of Thirst'. He arrived in Greyvale where Beren, King Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung joined with Huan the Hound in the Hunting of the Wolf.

At last, he was discovered within the borders of Greyvale itself, where he fought his last fight with Huan: the wolf and the hound took one another's lives in that combat. 

Both Beren and Huan were mortally wounded. When Mablung cut open the belly of the beast, he found there the Starstone with Beren's hand still around it, but when he touched the flesh it was no more. or carch ("fang"). Based on the above, perhaps the name can be analyzed into the unattested words **carn* (an alternate version of *caran*) and **caroth* ("maw"), the latter ending with the augmentative suffix *-oth* also seen in *Nogoth* "(Big) Forgekin" = *naug* + *oth* ("maw" = "big jaw").

Note that the final letter of *car(a)**n*** + the initial letter of ***c**arach/oth-* produce the sound **ch** (IPA: ) with the phenomenon called nasal mutation.

His later name *Anfauglir*, is probably composed of Amtreadan *and* ("long") + *faug* ("thirst") + *lîr* ("jaws").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
Originally Carcharoth's name was ***Karkaras***, the Knife-fang, who was the father of wolves. He was a great grey wolf.

***Borosaith*** meaning "Everhungry" is another name for Carcharoth, and it is said to be used in old songs.

## Inspiration
For the creation of Carcharoth, the chronicler was clearly influenced by the wolf Fenrir in Norse mythology, who bit off  Týr's hand, and was also tormented by ceaseless pains.
