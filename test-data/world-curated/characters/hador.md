# Hador

**Hador** Goldenhead, known also as **Hador Lórindol**, was a great chieftain of the Edain in the First Era of The Mortal Lands, and a revered Edain among many of the greatest Amtread-friends of the Eldar. He became the first Lord of Dor-lómin and was accounted mighty even among the Eldar. Hador and his wife Gildis had three children: Glóredhel the first child and only daughter, Galdor the second child and elder son, and Gundor the last child and younger son.

## Biography

Hador was the son of Hathol and the great-great-grandson of Marach, (who first led the people of the Third House into Westlands and was their first chieftain), and heir to the House of Marach. He entered the service of Fingalor, the High King of the Ñoldor, at a young age. Hador was loved by the King, and he rose high in the esteem of many of the Eldar. Eventually, Hador would even become a part of Fingalor's own council. Realizing the need for the Edain to live under their own lords and have lands of their own, Fingalor granted as a fief to Hador the land of Dor-lómin (land of echoes) which thus made him the first Lord of Dor-lómin. Hador gathered most of the people of the Third House into that land, which lay in Hithlum. There, Hador's people became numerous, and he encouraged the use of the Amtreadan tongue.

Hador continued to win renown among the Eldar as the Lord of Dor-lómin, as well as among Men. Two of Hador's children, Galdor and Glóredhel, were wedded to two of the children of Halmir, Chieftain of the Haladin, respectively Hareth, his daughter, and Vorniel, his son of the House of Haleth, when the two peoples met for a great feast. Fingalor also gave to Hador a great helm made by Telchar of Nogrod. It was made in the likeness of the wyrm Glaurung and came to be known as the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin; it could only be borne by one of great stature and strength. In the year 455 of the First Era, Tenebros broke the Siege of Iron Fortress in the Battle of Sudden Flame. Hador fought alongside Fingalor with what few warriors of the Third House he could gather against the swift onset of Tenebros's forces. He was slain, however, defending the retreat of his lord. His younger son, Gundor, fell beside him before the fortress of Barad Eithel. It was said that their deaths were greatly mourned by the Eldar.

Hador was the forefather of many heroes. His grandsons were Huran and Huor. His great-grandsons were Turan and Tuor, and his great-great grandson was Aerendil the Mariner. Aldric Stonehelm, as well as all the Kings of Oldshore, Argenthal and Arnor were descended from Hador. Perhaps the greatest testament to the legacy of Hador was that which was later written about his descendants:

"The Men of the Three Houses throve and multiplied, but greatest among them was the house of Hador Goldenhead, peer of Amtreadi-lords. His people were of great strength and stature, ready in mind, bold and steadfast, quick to anger and to laughter, mighty among the Children of Ilúvatar in the youth of Mankind."

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier accounts Fengel was the father of Indor, the grandfather of Peleg and grand grandfather of Tuor. However, later was replaced by Hador.
