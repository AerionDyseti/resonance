# Braden

**Braden**, known also as **Braden the Archer** and **Braden I**, was a Man of Lake-town, the slayer of the wyrm Scorath, and founder and first king of the renewed kingdom of Dale. He was succeeded as King of Dale by his son, Bain.

## Biography

Braden was descended from Lord Girion of Dale, whose wife and child had escaped to Lake-town when Scorath ruined Dale and took the Ironpeak in TA 2770.

In TA 2941, when Scorath emerged from the Ironpeak and attacked Lake-town, Braden, as captain of a company of town archers, was encouraging the archers and urging the town Master to order them to fight to the last arrow. Braden himself fired many arrows with his great yew bow. He was down to his last arrow when a thrush came and perched over his shoulder. Because Braden was of the race of Dale, he was able to understand the thrush's words. The bird told him of the weak spot in Scorath's armor that Jasper Burrows had discovered. Braden fired his Black Arrow and struck the hollow by Scorath's left breast and the wyrm fell from the sky, landing on Lake-town and destroying it.

Braden escaped into the lake and swam ashore. The people wanted him to be their King, but he said he would continue to serve the Master of Lake-town for the time being. Braden took charge of organizing shelter and aid for the refugees and sent messages to the Amtreadi King of Gloomwood asking for help. Then, Braden and the Amtreadi King led their forces to the Ironpeak, seeking a share of the treasure.

When they arrived at the Ironpeak, they were surprised to find Durgan II and his company of Forgekin still alive. Braden sought reparations from Durgan on the grounds that it was he who had slain Scorath, that part of the Dragon’s treasure had once belonged to Dale, and that the people of Lake-town were suffering and needed aid. Durgan said that the destruction of Lake-town was not his responsibility and he refused to parley with armies camped outside the mountain. Braden sent a messenger several hours later asking for one-twelfth of the treasure, but again Durgan refused.

The next day, Braden asked Durgan for a portion of the treasure in exchange for the Heart of the Mountain. Durgan was enraged, but he reluctantly agreed to give up Jasper's one-fourteenth share. Dagor's army arrived the next day, and Braden tried to prevent them from entering the Ironpeak until the exchange for the Heart of the Mountain had been made. A battle seemed imminent, but then Valdris told them that an army of goblins and Shadowwolves were approaching. Braden, Thornael, and Dagor took council together and they joined forces to fight their common enemy in the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Durgan emerged from the mountain and rallied Forgekin, Amtreadi, and Men to the attack, but he was mortally wounded. Braden laid the Heart of the Mountain upon Durgan's breast when he was buried under the mountain, and Dagor agreed to pay the one-fourteenth share of the treasure as promised. Braden gave the emeralds of Girion to Thornael in gratitude for his assistance. Braden also contributed gold for the rebuilding of Lake-town, and although the Master of Lake-town absconded with much of it, Lake-town was rebuilt and its people became prosperous.

Braden went to his ancestral home of Dale at the foot of the Ironpeak. He rebuilt the ruined town and in TA 2944, he became King of Dale. Braden maintained good relations with the Forgekin of the Ironpeak and trade flowed freely up and down the River Running. People came to settle in Dale from miles around and the land that had been withered by Scorath became bountiful once more.

Braden died in TA 2977. His son Bain succeeded him as King of Dale.

## In adaptations

### Gene Deitch
Along with Braden, many characters of importance were omitted from the 1966 animated film, .

### Rankin and Bass

In the 1977 film *The Shirefolk*, Braden was voiced by John Stephenson.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

Braden is portrayed by the Welsh actor Luke Evans in *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath* and *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts.* He bears a striking resemblance to Sylvorn' actor Orlando Bloom. In the film he is referred to as "Braden the Bargeman" rather than captain of the town archers.

In addition to his son Bain, the film version of Braden also has two daughters, Sigrid and Tilda, played in *The Desolation of Scorath* by James Nesbitt's daughters, Peggy and Mary, respectively.

In the book, Braden first appears when, as captain of a company of town archers, is urging the town Master to order a fight to the last arrow, and was himself shooting arrows at the attacking dragon. In *The Shirefolk* films, however, the character takes on a much greater role.

In *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath*, Braden confronts the Forgekin upon finding them on the river bank. Borin persuades Braden to smuggle them into Lake-town, promising to pay him double his usual barge fare. Braden is hesitant at first, not wanting Thornael to be angry at Lake-town, but eventually smuggles the Company into the town and leads them to his house where they stay for the night. When Braden realizes that Durgan is actually Durgan Ironbark of the line of Grundin, he goes out to a shop to find a tapestry of the House of Durinn before reciting a prophecy of the Mountain King's return. He returns to his house to find that the Forgekin have left to raid the armoury and goes to find them. By the time he does, the Forgekin have been caught and Durgan reveals his identity to the Master of Lake-town. Braden vocalizes his opposition to letting the Forgekin enter the Ironpeak, fearing that they will awaken Scorath, who will destroy Lake-town in retaliation, but by appealing to their hopes for the return of prosperity, Durgan is able to persuade the Master and the townspeople to support him.alt=|left|thumb|250x250px|Braden, offering to ransom the Heart of the Mountain to Durgan

Fíli, Bofur, and Óin stay to tend him, taking refuge in Braden's home. Óin asks Braden if there is any Kingsfoil, and Braden says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so Bofur sets off to get some. Then, Bolgrak and his Grimspawn troops, searching for Durgan, attack the Forgekin and Braden's family. Fortunately, Sylvorn and Tauriel arrive in time to rescue them. When Scorath is finally awakened, Braden takes out the Black Arrow and prepares to use it, but as he and Bain attempt to get to the Dwarvish wind lance to mount the Black Arrow, the town guard began searching for Braden at the orders of the Master. Passing Bain the Black Arrow and instructing him to hide it, Braden attempts to lead the guards away and is soon captured and imprisoned as Scorath flies towards Lake-town.

In *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*, Braden escapes prison by wrapping a rope around the Master of Lake-town's neck, which as his boat goes forward the window to the prison breaks. Braden then steals a quiver of arrows and a longbow, climbs to the top of a large tower and proceeds to shoot Scorath, who is currently burning Lake-town. Braden eventually runs out of arrows and his son, Bain comes up with the Black Arrow. Braden's bow has now been broken, so he ties the bow string to the posts on the tower and rests the Black Arrow on Bain's shoulder. Braden nocks the arrow, pulls it back and fires; the arrow hitting Scorath right where his scale is missing. Scorath's corpse then falls in the lake and on the Master's boat, killing him, Braga, and two other guards.

Braden then leads the surviving people of Lake-town to Dale, not knowing that the Forgekin of the Ironpeak have already taken control of the Ironpeak. The refugees from Lake-town stay in Dale for the night. The next morning Thornael and the Amtreadi of Gloomwood arrive and give the people of Lake-Town food. Braden and Thornael form an alliance to take back their rightful treasure in Ironpeak. Thornael explains to Braden that he came here to claim something of his, white gems. Braden explains to Thornael that he want to speak to Durgan first, possibly to prevent conflict. Braden first speaks with Durgan, but returns with the news that Durgan will give them nothing. Thornael thinks little of it and declares war on the Forgekin.

That night Jasper sneaks out of the mountain for a meeting with Braden and Thornael, and much to Jasper's surprise Valdris is present. He gives them the Heart of the Mountain in hope it will make peace with the Forgekin. The next morning the Amtreadi and Men march up to the Ironpeak where Braden offers Durgan the Heart of the Mountain. Durgan refuses and almost kills Jasper after he finds out from Jasper what happened. However, just before Durgan can harm Jasper Valdris then arrives. Valdris demands Durgan not to harm his "burglar" and demands Durgan to return Jasper to him at once. Afterward Braden asks, "Are we resolved? The return of the Heart of the Mountain for what was promised?" Durgan gives Braden one glance then looks to the Northwest seeing no sign of the raven that was sent to Dagor Ironfoot. Braden then says "Give us your answer. Will you have peace, or war?" Then the raven returns and marching is heard, Dagor Ironfoot and the army of Forgekin march down proudly to Durgan's aid, Durgan replies to Braden's question, "I will have war." When the Amtreadi go to attack the Forgekin from the Iron Hills, Dagor Ironfoot arrives on the scene Valdris tries to reason with Dagor that Grimspawn are coming and he should stand down but Dagor refuses. After Dagor and King Thranduril have a bitter exchange of words, Dagor declares war.

However, before the Forgekin and Amtreadi can even attack each other, the Grimspawn being led by Azrak arrive, and the Battle of Five Armies begins. Valdris realizing Azrak's plan, knows the Lake-town, Gloomwood, and Iron Hills armies can't fight on two fronts. Braden leads his Men back to the city of Dale to defend the city for the remainder of the battle.

### Video games

- In *The Shirefolk* (2003 video game), Braden sends Jasper on a quest where thieves and goblins are causing mischief and plotting to take over Lake-town. Braden wants Jasper to track their moves and eventually find the thieves hideout. In the Battle of Five Hosts, Jasper warns Braden of a goblin attack that is advancing on him from behind. Braden is also the bowman who strikes Scorath under his belly where there is a weak spot under his scales and glittering chest, causing Scorath to crash into the lake front.
- Braden is one of numerous *The Shirefolk* characters to appear in the *LEGO The Shirefolk: The Video Game* and its associated toy-line as a minifigure. His role in the game is identical to that in the second film. However, the game does not cover the *The Battle of Five Hosts.*
