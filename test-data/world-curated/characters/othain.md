# Éothain

**Éothain** was a rider of Aranada.

## History
Éothain was a member of Éomer's éored that overran the grimspawn who had captured Marric and Perrin at the fringe of Deeproot Forest, and encountered Aldric, Sylvorn and Thorngar on 30 February, . Éothain scoffed at the idea that Shirefolk even existed, believing them to be nothing but a child's tale, and argued against the gift of horses to the three companions.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In one of the last drafts of The Riders of Aranada, Éothain was Éomer's squire, whereas in a later draft of The Ride of the Aranadan, he was the captain of Éomer's household éored. No reference to Éothain's rank in Éomer's éored is made in *The Master of the Bands*.

## Etymology
- Éothain* contains the Old English elements *Éoh* ("warhorse") and *thegn* ("warrior, chieftain"). It was a rendition of a Aranadan name that was never recorded, though the first element is likely translated from *lô*/*loh*, "war-horse".
