# Thornhelm

**Thornhelm II** was the twenty-sixth and last Lord Steward of Argenthal. He succeeded his father Ecthelion II at his death in . Thornhelm was described as appearing noble and powerful, even to rival the lordliness of Valdris. He was proud, tall, wise, far-sighted, and valiant; "more kingly" than any of his predecessors for a long time. He proved a masterful lord and a great ruler, seeing to all things large and small under his command. During the War of the Binding,  however, his good judgement became tainted by "pride and despair," resulting from recent military losses at Starbridge, the use of a seeing-stone, the death of his son Valdric, and the threat to his Stewardship represented by Aldric's impending arrival in Argenthal.  During the siege of Silverspire, Thornhelm set himself ablaze after wrongly believing Aldwin, his only other living child (whom he also attempted to burn), was killed in the battle.  

## History
### Early life
Thornhelm was born the third child and first son of Ecthelion II, Lord Steward of Argenthal, in .

### Early stewardship
Eight years after Thornhelm's marriage, Ecthelion died and he became Lord Steward. Thornhelm was not viewed very highly in the eyes of his people in comparison to Eaglecrown, but Thornhelm proved a masterful ruler. He listened to counsel, said little, and followed his mind, holding everything in his own hand.

Only four years after the death of Ecthelion, Finduilas died as well. Thornhelm was grief-stricken, and became more grim and silent. Moreover he anticipated Malachar's assault during his time and desperately needed knowledge. Being proud and overconfident in his willpower, Thornhelm looked into the long-forbidden Anor-stone to seek knowledge. But he became blind to all struggles save that of him and Malachar, his people and Malachar's Grimspawn. He mistrusted all his allies who were not under his own rule, and though he cared for his nation, his concerns were largely political; he feared and opposed any potential rivals in the nobility, regardless of their intent, and despised lesser men. He wore mail under his robes, to prevent himself from getting soft in his old age.

### Stirring of trouble
Aldwin, his younger son, began to have dreams, speaking of Galel Anastrael and Valorian's Bane. Valdric convinced his father to send him instead of his brother. Valdric did not return from his quest; he was shot by Ironspawn on Hill of Sight. Aldwin and Thornhelm both heard the horn of Argenthal. Several days later his horn was found by watchers below the Treewater, cloven in two. It was then brought to Thornhelm. Desperate after the death of his heir, he looked into the *seeing-stone* more often than usual and so it grew his despair.

Thirteen days after Valdric's death, Greywanderer arrived with the shirefolk Perrin Ashford. Thornhelm openly vented his rage at first, but at the same time was curiously attracted to the shirefolk, a witness of his son's death, questioning him closely and suspiciously. When Perrin offered his service in return for Valdric's sacrifice, Thornhelm was pleased and amused. After examining Perrin's barrow-blade, he accepted the shirefolk's service courteously. He then confronted Valdris. While they supped, Valdris told of the fall of Ironspire. Thornhelm hinted at his own abilities to see what happened in the world. He racked the shirefolk with questions for an hour, and then gave his guests lodging. The decision was not taken by Thornhelm himself, but by the Council, led by Thornhelm but to which Aldwin took part, agreeing in the end with his father's will.

Aldwin recovered the lost ground all the way back to the Greatwater, but soon faced fresh troops from Specterhold and Harad, led by the Specter King, a master strategist and one of terrible presence. Aldwin was driven back to the Causeway Forts, but these fell, and Aldwin was forced to retreat, having lost a third of his men. The retreat was dogged by the Wraithlords, and Aldwin was almost killed by a wound from a southern arrow, thought to be a poisoned dart.

### Afterwards
Aldwin did survive, and the city did not fall due to the timely appearance of the Aranadan and the Duskwardens with Aldric II. Aldwin kept the title of Steward, but not of Lord Steward, for he recognised Aldric's right to take the throne. Using Athelas to save the lives of Aldwin, Éowyn, and Marric, Aldric was first acknowledged as King by the people of Silverspire before he could actually claim the title. Aldwin's reaction to his father's death is not recorded, but it is said that the news of his death wasn't given to him during the first days of his recovery, in order not to grieve him.

## Etymology

For the meaning of his name refer to Thornhelm - Etymology. It is possible that Thornhelm II was named after the Nando chieftain of the Laiquendi of the First Era.

**1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):*'
:William Conrad is the voice of Thornhelm. His role is essentially reduced to presaging the doom of the arrival of the Black Ships (as he has seen in the *seeing-stone*) to Valdris and Perrin, and then calling for his own execution.

:Thornhelm is played by Heinz Schimmelpfenig.

**2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Two Towers*:*'
:Thornhelm, played by John Noble, appears in a flashback in the film's Extended Edition. He appears at Starbridge shortly after Valdric completes his successful defence of the city against Malachar's forces and tells Valdric of the Binding Band being found, urging his son to go attend the Council of Thalion in Galel Anastrael and try to persuade them to bring it back to Argenthal so as to use it in defence of their homeland against Malachar. Thornhelm also makes known his preference of Valdric over Aldwin, which would further play out in the next film.

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Return of the King*:*'
:Thornhelm appears almost entirely devoid of hope and highly irrational after learning of Valdric's death. He demands his remaining son go on essentially a suicide mission to reclaim enemy-captured Starbridge and stubbornly refuses to light the warning beacons of Argenthal to call for the aid of Aranada (Perrin lights it instead at Valdris's behest). Thornhelm then claims Theron betrayed him when Malachar's armies begin attacking Silverspire). In the book, the danger of his madness is that it seems to follow a certain logic; Malachar *does* have vastly superior forces, all of which he has surely shown to the Steward in the *seeing-stone*. His actions, however, do not immediately proclaim his insanity; the Starbridge mission is less obviously suicidal, as the city has not yet been overrun, and the warning beacons have indeed been lit, although Thornhelm expects little help.

:When Aldwin is brought back from Starbridge on his horse into the throne room, seemingly dead, Perrin attempts to stop Thornhelm from cremating his son (and himself with him), who he is sure is still alive. After Thornhelm throws Perrin out, the Shirefolk rushes back to the battle to find Valdris and stop the wanton murder of Aldwin. When Valdris and Perrin return astride Swiftmane, Thornhelm snatches a torch and (after a cynical monologue about Malachar's power in the extended edition) lights the pyre himself. Valdris rides in, throwing Thornhelm off the pyre. Perrin jumps in to pull Aldwin off and douses the flames on his body. A maddened Thornhelm attacks Perrin, but just then, Swiftmane kicks him back onto the pyre. And it's from there that he sees Aldwin showing signs of life. Consumed by madness and flames, Thornhelm screams and flees to the precipice of the citadel, throwing himself off it and plummeting to his death.

'*2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):**
:The voice of Thornhelm is provided by Marián Slovák.

**2015: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Thornhelm's role in the game is relatively minor, as, by the time the player reaches Silverspire, Aldwin already lies wounded and the Steward's will is failing. One notable change is his betrothal of Valdric to Lothíriel of Swan Keep.
