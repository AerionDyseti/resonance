# Farmer Turnip

**Farmer Turnip** was a Shirefolk who at the time of the War of the Binding owned a farm called Bamfurlong in the Marish in the Eastshire of the Shirelands.

## Character and appearance
Farmer Turnip was broad, thickset with a round red face, a shrewd shirefolk who was friendly to all Clearbrooks (and on friendly terms with Tom Willowmere

Like most inhabitants of the Marish, which was fertile but boggy, the Maggots lived in a house instead of a shire-hole. Turnip had a wife, at least two sons and three daughters, plus a few other shirefolk working for him; around ten persons belonged to his family and farm-household.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first phase of writing *The Master of the Bands* the visit to Farmer Turnip was roughly the same as the final version, but in a much abbreviated form.  Bingo (who would later be named Tomlen Burrows) had never stolen mushrooms from Bamfurlong.  The farmer had only one small dog named Gip and while he had a wife, no children or other members of the household were mentioned.  At the first sight of the dog, Bingo put on his Ring and stayed invisible during the visit.  Odo and Tomlen Ashford (who were later changed into Perrin and Sam) enjoyed a beer while Turnip told them of the visit by the Shadow Rider.  At the end of the story invisible Bingo lifted Turnip's mug and drank his beer, scaring the old farmer who was glad to see the two (visible) shirefolk run away.  The shirefolk did not get a wagon ride to the Ferry nor did they receive any mushrooms.

When J.R.R. the chronicler came to write about Tom Willowmere he toyed with the idea of making Farmer Turnip some other creature than a shirefolk, possibly akin to Tom himself. As this notion brewed a line was given to Tomlen Ashford stating that Turnip was "not a shirefolk – not a pure shirefolk anyway" and that he had hair under his chin.

Farmer Turnip changed considerably in the second phase of writing the story, although he was still a shirefolk. Now the Binding Band was much more dangerous and Bingo was not supposed to wear it frivolously. However, the chronicler still wanted to retain the mysteriously levitating beer mug incident, which meant that Bingo had to wear the Band in Turnip's house.  To justify this the visit to Bamfurlong took on a much darker hue.  Young Bingo used to steal mushrooms.  One day, in fear of being mauled, he threw a rock at one of the farmer's dogs and killed it.  Turnip beat Bingo and told him he would kill him the next time he trespassed, and would have killed him then if Bingo had not belonged to a rich and powerful family. When the shirefolk approached the farm, terrified Bingo slipped on the Band. Inside the house Turnip emphasized his unrelenting hostility toward all Burrowses.  Bingo pulls the floating beer mug trick but then berates the bewildered farmer, pushes him into the fire-irons, and makes his hat sail out of the house.

Christopher the chronicler commented that the difficulty of keeping the Band secret eventually killed this version. When the story was rewritten again to make Turnip a shrewd but kindly soul the last of the lighthearted tricks with the Band was removed from the developing story.

In yet another version of the beginning Farmer Turnip's hostility, it was Jasper and Bingo who stumbled onto Turnip's farm one foggy evening.  They accidentally got into his garden and Turnip set a great wolf-like dog upon them.  Jasper broke the dog's head to save Bingo from a mauling and Turnip flung Jasper into a ditch. Turnip threatened to kill Bingo, Jasper threatened to come back armed, and Turnip said he had a weapon or two himself.
