# Beregond

**Beregond**, son of Baranor, was a soldier of Argenthal and later Captain of the White Company.

## History

### Early life

Beregond's fathers were from the vales of the White Mountains, and prior to that they lived in Moonvale.

Beregond was a member of the Third Company of the Citadel. He admired Aldwin and saw him as a brave warrior and a great leader. Beregond did not travel outside of Galim Vir often but understood the threat that Malachar posed to the city.

### War of the Binding

On the morning of March 9th, , Beregond was assigned to help Perrin Ashford who had just become a Guard of the Citadel. As Beregond had never met a shirefolk before, he was eager to meet Perrin and he was astounded that Perrin looked much like a child yet had faced more dangers than most Solaarans.

After helping to carry Aldwin to the Houses of Healing, Valdris gave the key to the Closed Door to the injured Aldwin. Beregond stood guard over Aldwin at the Houses of Healing and was present when he awoke.

#### Battle of the Obsidian Gate

Perrin and Beregond served under the command of Imrahil at the Battle of the Obsidian Gate. When a Stonelurk-chief charged their ranks, Beregond was stunned and nearly killed, but Perrin managed to save his friend by killing the Stonelurk, which fell on top of him.

### Later life

Upon Aldric's coronation on May 1st, Beregond was brought forward to receive judgement for leaving his post and for killing Thornhelm's guards on hallowed ground. The penalty would have been death, but the King showed mercy as the deeds were done out of love for Aldwin, and Beregond was merely dismissed from the Guard of the Citadel. For his bravery in battle, Aldric appointed him the Captain of the Guard of Aldwin, which was also called the White Company. He later went to live in Emyn Arnen in Moonvale to serve his lord, Aldwin, the new Prince of Moonvale.

## Etymology

- Beregond* may stem from *beren* meaning ("bold") and *gond\* ("stone"). He was likely named after the steward bearing the same name.
