# The Deepflame

'''The Deepflame''' was a Flamefiend who had no other recorded names.

The Deepflame was notable for surviving the War of Wrath. After sleeping deep within the Misty Mountains for thousands of years, he was awoken by the Forgekin of Shadowdeep in the Third Era and was responsible for the death of King Grundin VI and the ruin of Shadowdeep. It was this Flamefiend that was encountered by the Company of the Band during the Quest of the Band.

## History

### Early history

The Deepflame was first created as a Ascended. However, like other evil spirits, the Flamefiend followed Tenebros to The World soon after its creation, contending with Luth and other The Pantheon.

It is not known in which of the Battles of Westlands The Deepflame fought in until the end of the First Era, nor whether he served under Gorthak, the Lord of Flamefiends. When the Host of the The Pantheon defeated the hosts of Tenebros in the War of Wrath, The Deepflame managed to flee the overthrow of Thangorodrim and escaped into the east and hid in the roots of the Misty Mountains beneath Shadowdeep.

### Awakening and the Third Era

For more than five millennia, The Deepflame hibernated in his deep hiding place at the roots of the mountains in Shadowdeep. He remained undisturbed throughout the Second Era and most of the Third, before the _truesilver_-miners of Forgekin King Grundin VI awoke him in . Grundin was slain by the Flamefiend, at which point he became known as "The Deepflame"., and the survivors were forced to flee. and, as a result, many of the Liinadi Amtreadi of Goldwood fled to the south. Over the course of many years, he became acquainted with the ancient tunnels delved by mysterious nameless things underneath Shadowdeep and the Mountains.

Around , Grimspawn began to make secret strongholds in the Misty Mountains to block all of the passes, and Malachar began to send some of his creatures to Shadowdeep. The Flamefiend allowed the Grimspawn and stonelurks to remain in Shadowdeep while he dwelt there, but they feared him.

The Battle of Azanulbizar was the climactic battle in the War of the Forgekin and Grimspawn. It took place before the Great Gate of Shadowdeep in T.A. 2799 and was a victory for the Forgekin. However, the victors did not conquer Shadowdeep because Dagor Ironfoot, having slain the Grimspawn Azrak, felt the terror of the Flamefiend at the gate. Despite a failed attempt to recolonize Shadowdeep by Borin in T.A. 2989, The Deepflame remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the Forgekin, and its nature remained hidden to the outside world.

### Passing of the Company

In January of T.A. 3019, the Company of the Band travelled through Shadowdeep on the way to Doomfire Peak, reaching the Bridge of Shadowdeep on 15 January of that year.

In the first full narrative of the chapter, the description of the Flamefiend is more human-like, which the chronicler noted should be changed to be less clear: "_A figure strode to the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go before it. They could see the furnace-fire of its yellow eyes from afar; its arms were very long; it had a red [?tongue]. Through the air it sprang over the fiery fissure. The flames leaped up to greet it and wreathed about it. Its streaming hair seemed to catch fire..._". the chronicler also rejected a sentence of Valdris's cry to the Flamefiend: "_Go back into the fiery depths. It is forbidden for any Flamefiend to come beneath the sky since Fionwë son of Luth overthrew Thangorodrim._"

Although it had no repercussion on the final version of the story, the chronicler considered in a hasty note that the battle on the Bridge was actually between Valdris and Morvain, apparently resulting on Valdris coming out clad in white.

In the drafts of the "Goldwood" chapter, Caelorn and Aelindra think that no Flamefiend could lie in the Misty Mountains, so it should have been sent by Malachar from Doomfire Peak.

'*1978: *The Master of the Bands\* (1978 film):**
:The Flamefiend has wings and appears capable of limited flight. The head resembles a lion but the rest of the body was rendered in matte black, a technique commonly used for shadowy surreal effect in rotoscope animation.
**1981:** \***The Master of the Bands (1981 radio series)'''''

The identity of The Deepflame as a Flamefiend is apparently common knowledge among the Wise as Valdris explains its history to the Company in Shadowdeep before their encounter with it. He initially fails to connect this with the dark power he encounters, and Caelorn still has no knowledge of it. Flamefiends are bafflingly stated to be the deadliest of the servants of Malachar though Valdris also refers to it as a Spawn of Tenebros

'*2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:*'
:The Deepflame has wings. Jackson's Demon of Might was indistinct, a real blend of shadow and fire. Only his horned head, cloven feet, and clawed hands could clearly be seen. In the film continuity, the Grimspawn of Shadowdeep (here specified as "goblins") have crafted their armor and weapons to match the fiery appearance of the Flamefiend. Valdris is also aware of the creature's identity prior to entering Shadowdeep, having previously learned of it from Morvain.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):*'
:The Flamefiend is the boss of the level "Abyss Fight". He cannot be harmed except when he is stunned with Valdris's lightning.

'*2003: *The Master of the Bands: The Third Era*:*'
:The players must assist Valdris in his fight with the Flamefiend. This fight is notable among players of the game for its difficulty and the Flamefiend's very high amount of health points.

'*2004: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands*:*'
:Many of the Evil factions can summon a Flamefiend, specifically The Deepflame, for a short period of time. He is one of the mightiest units in the game, only able to be summoned with experience points. He is similar in design to the Flamefiend in the movie.

'*2006: *The Master of the Bands: The Battle for The Mortal Lands II\*:\*\*
:Like in the previous installment, the Flamefiend can be summoned by evil factions.

**2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:\*'
:The real name of The Deepflame is given as "**Askâdurs\*\*" and he is revealed to have fought against Forgekin as part of Tenebros's armies during the First Era. He is encountered in various flashback instances (where the player controls historical characters), which showcase his awakening by Forgekin in TA 1980, the fall of Shadowdeep the year after and the Forgekin of Borin's company fleeing from the ancient evil, among others. After Valdris defeats him, the lifeless body of The Deepflame can be found on the slopes of Zirakzigil. Despite the players knowing that the Flamefiend is dead, another Servant of Malachar tests their will and fears by portraying an illusion of him. In the illusion, the fight between Valdris and the Flamefiend on the Endless Stair is recreated, until it ends the opposite way of the actual event: the Flamefiend defeats the Wizard, throwing his lifeless body from Zirakzigil. Players have to defeat the Flamefiend in order to combat the illusion.

'*2009: *The Master of the Bands: Conquest*:*'
:The Deepflame is resurrected after his defeat by Valdris, and must be fought again in Shadowdeep. In the Evil Campaign, The Deepflame is playable in two battles. He kills Thorngar, who makes his last stand in Shadowdeep, and Rootbeard, who takes part in the final battle for the Shirelands.

'*2013: *Lego The Master of the Bands: The Video Game*:*'
:The Deepflame is only seen as a light that chases the player(s) through Shadowdeep. When they reach the Bridge of Shadowdeep, he appears in a cutscene where Valdris destroys the bridge and the Flamefiend pulls him down. The player then controls Valdris and has to grab Foebreaker and land on The Deepflame and stab him while avoiding the Flamefiend's fiery breath. When this is over, the game starts another cutscene that ends the level. Later, Valdris appears on a snowy mountain with a tower on top. When he reaches the top of the tower, the Flamefiend climbs on. The Flamefiend repeatedly sweeps his fiery whip and strikes the ground with his sword. Lightning then begins to strike at one place and the Flamefiend breathes fire and is weakened. Valdris then uses his sword to direct the lightning at The Deepflame and his health goes down. The lightning will strike at three different places and when the Flamefiend loses all of his health by being hit three times, he will fall off the mountain and die.

'*2022: *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*, Season One:**
:**Episode 7: *The Eye*:*'
::The Deepflame makes an appearance lurking beneath a large Truesilver vein at the very depths of Shadowdeep. When an orange leaf lands directly in front of him and catches on fire, disturbing his slumber, the Flamefiend roars.

'*2024: *The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding*, Season Two:*'
:The Deepflame appears after Grundin III digs into a cavern full of Truesilver at the urging of a Forgekin Band of Binding. In spite of his son Grundin IV's attempts at saving him, he is killed after removing his ring and jumping toward the Flamefiend with his axe before the entire cavern collapses around him.
