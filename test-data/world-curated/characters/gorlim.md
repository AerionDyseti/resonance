# Gorlim

**Gorlim**, also known as **Gorlim the Unhappy** was one of the XII Bëorings who followed Barahir in Dorthonion.

## Biography

The tale of Beren and Luthiel in *The Starstone Tales* describes how Barahir, last lord of the Men of Ladros in Dorthonion, remained as an outlaw in his own land after it was lost to the Dark Lords Tenebros and Malachar in the Battle of Sudden Flame.

Barahir had twelve companions, one of these Gorlim, son of Angrim, but all their kin were scattered or killed. As Barahir and companions were camping at a secret hide-out in southern Ladros, Gorlim went out hunting near the area where he once lived, when he suddenly saw his old house standing as it long had, and through the window he saw his presumably dead wife, Eilinel. He came out of hiding to go to her, when he was captured by Grimspawn from the Fortresses of Lord Malachar and Lord Tenebros.

Gorlim was brought before Malachar, who told Gorlim that in return for revealing where Barahir and his company were hiding he would be reunited with his beloved wife. Gorlim accepted the offer and Barahir and his company were betrayed. Then Malachar revealed that Gorlim had seen but a spectre devised by him, for his wife was already dead, but that he would keep his word and reunite Gorlim with his wife: he had Gorlim put to death.

After Malachar's Grim-warriors had slain all of Barahir's remaining men but for his son Beren, who was out hunting Grimspawn, Gorlim appeared as a spectre before Beren, and confessed what he had done, giving Beren a chance to reclaim the Band of Barahir, heirloom of his house, and escape alive.

## In other versions

In an earlier version of the *Lay of Luthiel*, it was Tenebros himself that tricked Gorlim into betraying Barahir and his company, not his lieutenant Malachar; and Gorlim purposefully sought out Tenebros's servants, as opposed to the later versions, when they forcefully took him.
