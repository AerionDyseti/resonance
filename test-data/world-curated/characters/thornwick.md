# Thornwick

**Thornwick** (Adûnaic: "Tender Of Beasts")** the Brown** was one of five Wizards sent to The Mortal Lands to contest the will of Malachar. Originally a Ascended of Yavanna, Thornwick mainly concerned himself with the well-being of the plant and animal worlds, and thus did not participate heavily in the War of the Binding.

## Biography
### Years of the Lamps

Originally named **Aiwendil** (High Amtreadan: "Friend to birds"), Thornwick was a Ascended created before Time who descended into The World to serve the The Pantheon. Aiwendil served the Valië Yavanna, Queen of the earth.

When the Eternal Shore were separated from The World after the Downfall of Oldshore, Manwë was still concerned for the fate of the peoples of The Mortal Lands. Though Malachar had been overthrown, he had not been permanently vanquished. In time, his shadow began to emerge again. A council of the The Pantheon was summoned, and it was decided that they would send emissaries to The Mortal Lands. These messengers should be "mighty peers of Malachar, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh," as they were intended to help Men and Amtreadi unite against Malachar. These emissaries themselves, the wizards, did not match the Shadow Lord in power. Aulë chose Curumo (Morvain), Oromë chose Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Greycloaks), and Manwë chose Valorin (Valdris). Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him.

### Third Era
#### Arrival in The Mortal Lands
Around the year TA 1000, the Ascended arrived at the Mistport in the west of Eriador, having the form of old Men, whom the peoples called Wizards. Curumo arrived first and alone, and Aiwendil arrived at the same time as Valorin. When the Wizards took their mission, they roamed The Mortal Lands. In this period, Aiwendil was renamed "Thornwick" by the Ñoldor and became known for both his protection of the great Forests and his zeal for the animals, worrying little with the affairs of Men and Amtreadi, but was far more knowledgeable in plants, birds and beasts in the forest. He also turned away from Morvain during this period, unaware that the White Wizard despised him and considered him a fool.

In general, Thornwick was never much of a traveler. There is little told of his early journeys, but by the late Third Era, he had settled down and dwelt for a time at Rhosgobel, somewhere between the Carrock and the Menn-i-Naugrim. 

#### War of the Binding
In TA 2851, the Grey Council met once more, after which Morvain began to search the Gladden Fields for the Binding Band. Thornwick decided to aid his search, with birds and beasts acting as spies, hoping that Morvain's actions would help keep watch and hinder Malachar. Thornwick did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Morvain's true ambition to acquire and keep the Band for himself.

By the War of the Binding, Thornwick no longer dwelt in Rhosgobel. In summer of TA 3018, Morvain told Thornwick that he was willing to help Valdris and sent the Brown Wizard to seek Valdris at once. Thornwick knew little of Eriador but sought for the Shirelands, knowing that he would find Valdris nearby. His fate after the War of the Binding is untold, The similarity to Old English *rudugást* meaning "red-brown spirit" has also been noted by fans.

## Character

the chronicler's writing does not shed much light on Thornwick's personality. In the books, little is known about Thornwick apart from certain defining characteristics. Morvain was the chief of the Order of Wizards and Valdris came next in the order; Thornwick meanwhile held much less power and wisdom.

Thornwick displayed some qualities of innocence and naivety, making him an ideal accomplice of Morvain's plans, seen in providing his services to help the White examine the Gladden Fields. Morvain in turn considered him simple (minded) and a fool and can be heard saying that he (Thornwick) acted in a manner contrary to how an Greycloaks should behave. However, he was fundamentally good and honest and therefore did not fall to the shadow, but did fail in his appointed task. In , the chronicler writes that "indeed of all the Greycloaks, one only remained faithful," referring to Valdris.

## Abilities
In the books, during the Council of Thalion, Valdris referred to Thornwick as "*master of shapes and changes of hue*", but the meaning of this is open to question. He was wiser than any man in all things concerning herbs and animals. It is said that he spoke many languages of birds and was a friend to them and all animals.

## Behind the scenes
It is unknown if Thornwick left The Mortal Lands. J.R.R. the chronicler wrote that he forsook his mission as one of the Wizards by becoming too obsessed with animals and plants, so presumably failing, perhaps being disallowed to return to The Blessed Realm with honour.

Early in the process of writing , it is clear that the chronicler envisaged some role for Thornwick in the tale. He eventually decided that he would use Thornwick as the means of getting Valdris to Ironspire.

Initially Valdris describes Thornwick as his 'cousin', In the final version Valdris merely says that Thornwick is 'one of my order'.

When the chronicler finished writing the story up till Shadowdeep, he made notes on the future story development; therein he considered handing over Ironspire to Thornwick.

## In adaptations
### BBC Radio's *The Master of the Bands* (1981)
Donald Gee provided the voice of Thornwick in the BBC . He is introduced much earlier than in the book because his meeting with Valdris is given chronologically.

### *The Shirefolk* film trilogy

The character Thornwick and virtually all references to him were not used in the theatrical release of  directed by Peter Jackson. The character is also absent from the  of the same name.

Thornwick does appear in Peter Jackson's , although no scene involving him is corroborated by the chronicler's writings. In the , Thornwick is mentioned only once in passing, as Valdris's cousin. In the films, he is portrayed by actor Sylvester McCoy of *Doctor Who* fame.

Thornwick is portrayed as having an eccentric personality, but is also selfless and brave, as when seen healing the hedgehog Sebastian and when waylaying an Grimspawn pack so that Durgan and Company could go to Galel Anastrael. He is also highly intelligent, being a Wizard, having an adept understanding of nature and ability to perform healing spells and magical blasts. Thornwick's fidgety and slightly hyperactive speech pattern is somewhat of a trademark of actor Sylvester McCoy, who has a history of playing eccentric and comedic characters.

#### *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey*
Thornwick is first mentioned in  when Jasper Burrows inquires of Valdris whether there are any other wizards within The Mortal Lands. Valdris responds that there are five wizards, of whom Thornwick is one. Valdris says that Thornwick is a great wizard in his own particular way, also calling him a kind-hearted individual enjoying the solitude of standing guard over the Greenwood forest and preferring the company of animals to that of Men.

Thornwick is then seen investigating the Greenwood, noticing that much of the vegetation is beginning to decay and much of the animal life is sick or dying. Thornwick brings one of them, a hedgehog he calls Sebastian, back to his woodland house at Rhosgobel where he is able to nurse the hedgehog back to health. Thornwick comes to the realization that a type of powerful witchcraft has caused the decay of the Greenwood and its transformation into what would now become known as Gloomwood. After Rhosgobel is swarmed by Giant Spiders and he manages to save Sebastian, Thornwick investigates and identifies the origin of the evil as the supposedly abandoned fortress of Dol Guldur.

Thornwick makes his way to Dol Guldur aboard a sled pulled by Rhosgobel rabbits. While Thornwick is investigating Dol Guldur, he is attacked by the spirit of the Specter King of Coldreach. Thornwick is able to ward off his attacks and forces the Specter King to drop his Specter-blade and retreat. But before Thornwick could take a moment to breathe, he immediately senses another danger and turns to see a shadowy figure within the fortress, whom he believes to be the Dark Sorcerer. Without hesistation, Thornwick grabs the Specter-blade before fleeing out of the ruins. Sensing the danger as well, Thornwick's sled of Rhosgobel rabbits take off without their master, forcing the wizard to run on foot to catch up before eventually grabbing the reins. Fighting off the resident bats, Thornwick manages to make a difficult escape.

He immediately goes on the search for Valdris to inform him of the newfound threat within Gloomwood and is able to locate him within the Trollshaws accompanying Durgan and Company. Thornwick tells Valdris of the threat the Dark Sorcerer poses to The Mortal Lands from within Dol Guldur and presents the Specter-blade as evidence. Shortly afterwards, the company is attacked by a battalion of Shadowwolf-riders led by Yazneg. Thornwick volunteers to create a diversion with his sled of Rhosgobel rabbits, drawing the Shadowwolf-riders away from Durgan and company, who are able to reach the safety of the Hidden Valley of Galel Anastrael. Thornwick's rabbit sled's superiority in speed and maneuverability allows him to escape the Shadowwolf-riders before they are driven off by Amtreadi horsemen led by Thalion.

At the Grey Council meeting in Galel Anastrael, Valdris backs Thornwick's claim that the Dark Sorcerer poses a serious threat to The Mortal Lands. But the head of the Grey Council, the white wizard Morvain, remains skeptical and claims there is no evidence to support such a theory despite Thornwick's finding of the Specter-blade. Morvain sneers in contempt and suggests that excessive consumption of mushrooms has addled Thornwick's judgement and reduced his reliability.

#### *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath*
In , Thornwick meets Valdris inside the High Fells of Rhudaur and they find the tombs (or cells) of the Wraithlords broken into by 'dark spells'.

Thornwick is sceptical of Valdris's beliefs that the Dark Sorcerer summoned the Wraithlords to Dol Guldur, believing that no human sorcerer could accomplish this. However, Valdris reminded him that the Wraithlords only answer to their one true master, Malachar, whom he suspects is the true identity of the Dark Sorcerer. Realizing that Malachar plans on attacking the Ironpeak, Valdris attempts to leave to rejoin Durgan and Company, but Thornwick insists that they investigate Dol Guldur themselves assuming what Valdris believes is true. Upon arriving at the seemingly abandoned fortress, Valdris guessed that a spell of concealment had been erected over the place, suspecting that their enemy has not regained his full strength. Valdris sends Thornwick to take a message to Lady Aelindra while Valdris continues his own investigation of the 'abandoned' fortress. Before Valdris goes in, he has Thornwick swear not to save him should anything happen, especially believing it to be a trap.

#### *The Shirefolk: The Battle of Five Hosts*
In the , Thornwick is seen chanting an incantation, seemingly a telepathic communication to support Valdris as he attempts to break free from his cage. Later, he arrives at Dol Guldur where he takes Valdris to his sled, by the order of Aelindra. Thornwick provides Valdris a horse to ride to Ironpeak and his Wizard's staff to replace his old one. Valdris tells Thornwick to summon every bird and beast to join in the battle for the Ironpeak. Thornwick leads a charge of the Skywardens at the end of the battle to assist the Forgekin, Men, and Amtreadi. He rides one of the eagles (possibly Skycrest) along with Bjorn.

Thornwick regretted what had happed and used every opportunity to take the art back from the people who stole it against his will, but both tribes persisted in the untamed wilderness. During his stay in Rhosgobel, Thornwick had come across Creepkin who was stealing and eating the babies of the Woodmen and banished him from the Vales of Greatwater, causing Creepkin to crawl inside the caverns of the Misty Mountains.
