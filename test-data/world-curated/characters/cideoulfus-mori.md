## Campaign History (Sessions 1–10)

*Note: Cideoulfus is also called "Sid" in session notes.*

### The Case of the Missing Falcon (Sessions 1–2)

Sid participated in the falcon recovery and witnessed the organized surveillance network operating in Lux's streets.

### The Tainted Water Investigation (Sessions 3–10)

Sid's acrobatic combat style was showcased throughout the dungeon:

- Session 7: Used acrobatics and demoralization to reposition and disrupt enemy Echo Wight formations
- Engaged in tactical debates over tumbling through enemy spaces

**Key Tactical Insight (Session 10)**: When the party debated who should touch the cursed spear, Sid argued forcefully that **Sabrina should NOT touch it**—if the spear could override its wielder's will as myths suggested, a possessed Sabrina with her barbarian strength would be nearly impossible to stop. This proved prescient when Zeribella was possessed instead.

During the possession crisis:

- Attempted to disarm possessed Zeribella but was tripped by combat prowess she'd never displayed before
- Got knocked prone earlier when Kales collided with him in the magical darkness
- Session 9 notes describe him reclaiming his sword "in a really kick-ass maneuver"

### Session 11: Aranadan Revelations

**Major Backstory Reveal**: Around the campfire, Sid shared his history in full. He's Aranadan—his family was once nobility. His father "married the wrong woman"—his mother "married a man who pissed off the wrong person." A noble family called the **Marietas** holds a vendetta against his house.

The Marietas orchestrated his family's downfall: estates and land were stripped away, and they were "thrown into the street." Sid worked to keep his remaining family fed, housed, and in good schools. He went on expeditions, sending money home, until he was "betrayed, left for dead or prisoner." His family changed their names for safety.

**Twelve Years of Service**: Sid spent twelve years in service to people who sent him on suicide missions, enduring twenty years total of mockery for his fallen status. He won't return to Aranada until he doesn't have to hide—until he's built enough resources that he won't be forced back into service to people he doesn't want to serve.

**Family Status**: He doesn't know where his family is now; they likely think he's "still somewhere on an expedition." When asked if he misses his family: "Of course. Who doesn't miss her family?" (Zeribella's reaction to this comment was noted by both Sid and Shemsu—a clear implication that *she* doesn't miss hers.)

**Sense Motive Champion**: Sid rolled his *fourth* natural 20 on Sense Motive against Zeribella this campaign, continuing to notice her poor deception attempts and odd reactions.

**Friendship Debate**: When Sabrina called him a good friend, Sid deflected: "Acquaintances at best. We drink together." Sabrina: "Friends drink together, dumbass."
