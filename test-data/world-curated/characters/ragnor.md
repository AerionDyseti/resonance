# Ragnor

**Ragnor** was an Edain man of Dorthonion and one of the XII Bëorings who followed Barahir in the First Era.

## Biography

After the Battle of Sudden Flame, Ragnor remained with Barahir and his company who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Tenebros, thus they became outlaws surviving for nearly five years. He and the others were eventually betrayed to Malachar by the unhappy Gorlim and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
