# Gaffer Greenhand

**Hamlen Greenhand**, also known as **old Greenhand**, was a Shirefolk of the Shirelands, and the father of Colben Greenhand of the Company of the Band. He was the gardener of Burrow's End before he passed the title onto Sam.
## History

Hamlen was born in , the third son of Hobson Greenhand, who was a roper by trade. He had three siblings: Andwise Roper, May and Halfred of Overhill.

He entered the service of his relative, "Cousin Holman", and became a gardener. One of his first jobs was tending the garden of Burrow's End. He married Bell Goodchild, and they had six children: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, Colben and Marigold.

On 23 September, the night of the departure of Tomlen and Sam, Khamûl, one of the Wraithlords rode up the lane as the elderly shirefolk was taking his air, and asked about "Burrows". The Gaffer told him that he had left for Brookbury and it's not their business to know why, and refused to leave any message. The stranger hissed, making Hamlen shudder. Soon after the Wraithlords left, Sam arrived to give Hamlen the keys to Burrow's End before leaving. Surprised by Sam's arrival, old Greenhand told Sam about the stranger.

When Lotho and eventually Sharkin took over the Shirelands, old Greenhand was evicted from Burrow Row. After the Battle of Bybrook, in which he had only a marginal role, he moved back into the newly restored Burrow Row, the "New Row." He was looked after by the Widow Rumble, which Tomlen uses to comfort Sam about moving into Burrow's End. After his granddaughter is born, Sam calls his father to decide upon a name. Gaffer tells him to stick with the tradition of naming shire-girls after flowers and Tomlen gives Sam the name "Elanor". The Gaffer lived for another 7 years and died in Fourth Era 7.

His son, Sam, named his seventh child Hamlen after his father. In the King's Letter, the name (referring to Hamlen Gardner, the fourth son of Sam and Rose, not old Greenhand) is translated into Amtreadan as Baravorn. 

"Gaffer" is a colloquial word for "old man". It is a contraction of "grandfather."

## In other stories
In the illustrated short story *Mr. Bliss*, there is a resident in the village named Gaffer Greenhand who struggles to listen to the discussion between Mr Binks and Sergeant Millbrook about whether Mr Bliss should be locked up for failure to pay for his car. Sergeant Millbrook also has a son named Sam.

## Inspiration
In Letter 257, J.R.R. the chronicler recounts a holiday to Lamorna Cave in the early 1930's. To amuse his sons, he named a local Gaffer Greenhand. This "curious local character" was "an old man who used to go about swapping gossip and weather-fashion and such like". The surname was chosen because it alliterated with Gaffer.

the chronicler had several encounters with actual Greenhands, however. Greenhand Tissue, a word young Ronald considered comical, was named after J. Sampson Greenhand (1828-1886), a famous Birmingham surgeon, whilst in the Black Country dialect cotton wool was referred to as "gamgee". The Greenhands were notorious surgeons - years later, Dr. Leonard Greenhand tended those war-wounded, including Lieutenant the chronicler.

## Portrayal in adaptations
- '1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:The Gaffer does not appear in the film; but is mentioned to have been thrown out as Sam looks into the Mirror of Aelindra.
**1981: *The Master of the Bands* (1981 radio series):**
:John Church plays Gaffer Greenhand. He used a thick peasant accent for the role. He is included in early episodes including a full dramatisation of his encounter with the Wraithlords. Neither Tomlen or Sam learn of this exchange. He also features towards the end of the adaptation when he admonishes the returning Shirefolk for wearing "ironmongery." The Gaffer also is present as the travelers discuss how Sam should use Aelindra’s gift.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):'*
:Hamlen "Gaffer" Greenhand is played by Wolfgang Reinsch.

- '2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:'''
:Gaffer appears in the film's Extended Edition, where he is played by Norman Forsey. The conversation in the Ivy Bush is moved to the Green Griffin Inn, though the dialogue remains much the same. He does not appear at Sam's marriage in *The Return of the King*.

'*2002: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band* (video game):*'
:Gaffer appears twice; at first, he drinks at the Green Griffin, but during the night, he informs Tomlen of the Wraithlord that stalks the Shirelands. He was voiced by an uncredited Jim Piddock.

'*2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Hamlen Greenhand is found working in his garden just outside Burrow's End. He only offers one regional Shirelands quest, but has more story involvement during various seasonal festivals.
