# Barliman Butterbur

**Barliman Butterbur** was a Man of Crossway who was the owner of *The Wanderer's Rest*.

A short, fat, red-faced Man, he appeared to have had a rather bad memory.

## History
The Wanderer's Rest in Crossway was kept by the Butterbur Family for many generations and Barliman inherited it before the War of the Binding. He had two shirefolk employees: Bob, who worked in the stables, and Nob, a servant.

He did not remember it until autumn, when Tomlen and his companions arrived to stay at the inn, and even then it was long before the connection was made. He did, however, remember to produce Wanderer's credentials.

When Valdris finally arrived at The Wanderer's Rest, he was furious with Barliman's forgetfulness, but quickly forgave him when he found out the Shirefolk were alive. He even went so far as to put a blessing on his beer.

After the War of the Binding, Barliman was amazed to learn that Wanderer, a former patron of the Wanderer's Rest, had become king of Argenthal and Arnor.

## Etymology
Barliman means "barley-man", a suitable name for an ale-brewer.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first version of the events at the Wanderer's Rest, written in pencil, the name of the innkeeper was **Timothy Titus**, "a very small man" whose friends called him **Tim Tip**, from an old incomplete oral story by J.R.R. the chronicler. This character bore no resemblance to Mr. Butterbur.  Timothy Titus was written over in ink with the name **Barnabas Butterbur** in the chronicler's manuscript and was created as a very fat Shirefolk before he was subsequently changed into the man called Barliman.

'*1978: *The Master of the Bands* (1978 film):**
:Barliman was voiced by Alan Tilvern.

**1981: *BBC Radio's The Lord of the Band*:**
:James Grout provided the voice of Butterbur. Grout played what is a fairly minor character with great panache, and much of his garrulous dialogue from the book is intact, especially in the longer 1982 episodes.  Butterbur also appears in the penultimate instalment when the returning company stop off at Crossway.

**2001: *The Master of the Bands: The Company of the Band*:*'
:He is played by David Weatherley, although the character is not named and most of his scenes from the book (including the reference to Valdris's letter) are not in the film.

'*2001: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):**
:The voice of Barliman Butterbur is provided by Július Satinský.

**2007: *The Master of the Bands Online*:*'
:Barliman is a non-playable character that can be found at the Wanderer's Rest. The player meets with him during Volume I *Shadows of Angmar*, Book I: "Stirrings in the Darkness".

'*2010: *The Master of the Bands: Aldric's Quest*:**
: Butterbur appears briefly at the start of the Crossway mission, where he informs Aldric that he might learn the location of the Shirefolk by asking around town.

**2011: *The Master of the Bands: War in the North*:*'
:Barliman Butterbur is the inn-keeper, and can be found behind the bar in the Wanderer's Rest. He tells the player news about troubles in the south, and Southerners who have come lately to Crossway, and information about the Wanderer's Rest, that it almost exists as long as Crossway.

'*2013: *The Shirefolk: The Desolation of Scorath*:*'
:Though he does not appear in the film, a character credited as "Butterbur, Sr." appears in its prologue running the bar at the Wanderer's Rest -- apparently meant to be Barliman's father, thus implying the inn was a family-run establishment.
