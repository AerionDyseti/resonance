**Atan** and **Seba** are the party's camels, acquired for the desert expedition to the oasis.

## Personalities

- **Atan**: The friendlier of the two. Generally cooperative and easy to handle.
- **Seba**: Irritable and temperamental. Prone to flatulence at inopportune moments.

## Campaign History

### The Tainted Water Investigation (Sessions 4-10)

The camels were acquired for the desert journey following Vek-Khar to the distant oasis. They remained at the surface while the party explored the underground temple/cistern complex.

After the Dark Slayer battle and spear incident (Session 10), the camels had grown restless. The party calmed them with animal handling and diplomacy checks before beginning the return journey.

### Session 11: Return to Lux

Atan and Seba carried the party back across the Solaar Desert toward Lux. Shemsu noted "human vulnerability is... weird... the Camels are a lot less bothered" by the events. Seba contributed an ill-timed fart to the campfire ambiance.

## Current Status

Traveling back to Lux with the party.
