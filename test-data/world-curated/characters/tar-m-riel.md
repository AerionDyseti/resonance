# Tar-Míriel

**Tar-Míriel** or **Ar-Zimraphel** was the daughter of King Tar-Seeing-Stone, and last rightful heir of Oldshore. She would rule briefly as Queen Regnant while Ar-Pharazôn's armada defied the Ban of the The Pantheon and incurred Oldshore's destruction.

## Biography

Zimraphel was born in SA 3117 to Inziladûn (or Tar-Seeing-Stone) and was called **Míriel** in Amtreadan. Upon a time, she may have been sought after by Elentir, Amandil's brother and Aldorion's uncle, but was herself enamored by Pharazôn, her cousin, who was wealthy and highly esteemed. A relationship could have easily arisen between them, as Pharazôn was often abroad, in Oldshore's exploits on The Mortal Lands's coasts.

As the only child of Tar-Seeing-Stone, Míriel should have been the Ruling Queen, Pharazôn usurped her throne in SA 3255, becoming Ar-Pharazôn, and married her against her will, reneming her **Ar-Zimraphel** (as Ruling Queen, she would have preferred the High Amtreadan _Tar-_ and been **Tar-Míriel**).

Ar-Pharazôn thereafter sailed to The Mortal Lands upon hearing of the conquests of Malachar, and defeating him, brought him back to Oldshore. However, Malachar, in his fair form, corrupted the minds of many Oldbloods, including Ar-Pharazôn and his counselors. The culture of Oldshore quickly became eviller, Malachar turning many towards worship of Tenebros and the defilement of many good things in the hopes of evading death. Eventually, Ar-Pharazôn became desperate, and Malachar convinced the king to break the Ban of the The Pantheon by sailing to The Blessed Realm, saying by this he could gain eternal life.

For Ar-Pharazôn and his fleet's defiant action, and his setting foot in The Blessed Realm, The Primordial destroyed Ar-Pharazôn and his armada, and rent an enormous chasm under the Sea to destroy Oldshore. Amid the tumults, Míriel sighted a giant wave approaching to engulf the city, and attempted to ascend Meneltarma, but was caught by the waters and drowned before reaching the summit, as all of Oldshore slid into the depths.

## Appearance

She was "fairer than silver or ivory or pearls",

## Etymology

- Tar-Míriel* is High Amtreadan for "High-Jewel-daughter", from the word *mír* ("jewel"). *Ar-Zimraphel\* was the Adûnaic translation.

## In other versions

In another account, Míriel chose to marry Ar-Pharazôn voluntarily after being infatuated by his beauty and wealth.

## In adaptations

### _The Master of the Bands: The Bands of Binding_

Míriel is portrayed by American actress Cynthia Addai-Robinson in , in which she begins as the Queen-regent of Oldshore in an alternate Second Era, presiding over the land in place of her dying father, Tar-Seeing-Stone.

#### Season One

Míriel is first seen in the King's Court with Pharazôn (who is given a different occupation in the series: Oldshore's Chancellor) before a large crowd, when Aldorion, having discovered Aelindra and Halbrand on the remnants of a raft at sea, brings the pair before the Queen-regent. Aelindra demands passage back to The Mortal Lands and nearly creates open hostility by her forceful manner before Halbrand interjects and brokers a tentative agreement for her request to be considered. Afterwards, Míriel summons Aldorion back and questions him about his motives for bringing Aelindra to Oldshore, though Aldorion dismisses any suggestion he is friendly to the Amtreadi. Míriel then orders him to keep watch over the Amtreadi until a further decision can be made, though she visits her bedridden father, Tar-Seeing-Stone, to notify him of the perceived turning-point that has occurred.

Míriel dreams of the destruction of Oldshore by a great wave, though she initially is unsure of its meaning. That day, she hosts Aelindra for an audience, in which the Amtreadi demands military aid to go to the Southlands. Upon being denied this, Aelindra demands an audience with Tar-Seeing-Stone, which leads Míriel to throw Aelindra in prison. Míriel decides that Aelindra will be sent back to The Mortal Lands alone. On learning of this, Aelindra escapes her captors and breaks into the tower where Tar-Seeing-Stone dwells, though Míriel anticipated this and awaits her there. In order to show her the vision she herself has had, Míriel allows Aelindra to look into the seeing-stone housed there.
Aelindra is soon escorted to the docks to depart, but just as she enters the boat, Míriel is the first to notice the white leaves of Nimloth falling. Alarmed, she changes her mind and announces her intent to accompany Aelindra to the Southlands with an army, for the dual purpose of rescuing its people and installing Halbrand as king. Amid uncertainty over Halbrand's willingness to go, Míriel is challenged by those in Oldshore who oppose the action, namely Pharazôn's son Kemen, who burns two of the five ships set apart for the voyage. Míriel stays the course after Aelindra convinces Halbrand to return to The Mortal Lands, and sails with the small fleet.

After making landfall on the east bank of the Greatwater, the Oldbloods cavalry rides to Tirharad and vanquishes the contingent of Adar's army there, while Míriel and her personal guard observe from a distance. Afterwards, she partakes in celebrating with the Southlander survivors, and introduces Halbrand to them as their rightful king. Just then, all present is taken aback when Doomfire Peak erupts, sending ash and fire over the surrounding lands. In the following chaos, Míriel attempts to help the survivors, but is caught in a burning structure and only just rescued by Valorian, son of Aldorion. Valorian is presumed dead, but Míriel is rendered blind by the ash, though she initially tries to hide the fact as Aldorion leads her back to the Oldbloods camp. Once there, she pronounces a return to Oldshore, but also that she will come back to The Mortal Lands with an even greater force. Aldorion is grieved at this prospect, but reaffirms his loyalty to her and to the cause of the Faithful on the return voyage. In their absence, however, King Tar-Seeing-Stone has died.

#### Season Two

Míriel finds herself in a complex situation when she returns to Oldshore. Thanks to her bracelet that allows her to access the tower where the seeing-stone is, she discovers that it has disappeared. She was crowned shortly afterwards (becoming Tar-Míriel) wearing a white dress which, according to Pharazôn, was a symbol of Oldshore's past glory. As the coronation has just begun, Aldorion's daughter Eärien brings the seeing-stone and reveals to the assembly in the room that Queen Míriel's choices are guided only by this vision stone, and that she is completely blinded. Tar-Míriel, although weakened, stands up in the face of Eärien's accusation, refusing to part with the seeing-stone, symbol of her vision for Oldshore.

The atmosphere became tense and the assembly was divided between those who supported the queen and those influenced by Ar-Pharazôn. The latter, a skilled manipulator, offers to take charge of the destruction of the artifact, playing on the fears of the assembly. Míriel, feeling her authority wavering, decides to protect the seeing-stone at all costs, and alienates part of the assembly. Some rebelled and tried to attack the queen, who was hardly protected by the royal guards. It is then that a majestic eagle enters the throne room, causing an impressive silence among the assembly. The powerful symbol of the eagle is usually interpreted as a good omen, and many believe that it came to support Queen Míriel. However, to everyone's surprise, Pharazôn calmly approaches the bird, using its presence to bolster its authority. He lays his hand on the eagle, as if accepting it as a sign of his own legitimacy, thus turning the omen in his favor. This bold move tilted part of the assembly to his side, exacerbating tensions and leaving Míriel in an increasingly difficult position.

Ar-Pharazôn has become king and Míriel is in the King's Tower, along with Aldorion. The latter supports her and is ready to carry out a coup d'état for her. She asks him what he saw in the Seeing-Stone. The captain is seen leaving the capital on horseback, as if lost. Míriel is relieved, the stone no longer shows the Downfall of Oldshore as it has in recent years. She is willing to sacrifice herself and believes that her cousin's appointment to the throne has ended the threat. She asks Aldorion to do nothing and to accept the new power without reacting.

Aldorion receives a visit from his daughter in his cell. Eärien begs him to change his mind and swear loyalty to the king, forgetting his pride. The captain replied that it was out of honour and faith and that they had nothing more to say. She then brings in Míriel who begs him in turn, but Aldorion is adamant in his choices. The The Pantheon will decide the truth.

Aldorion is brought before the sea to undergo his Trial by Abyss. Míriel then appears and asks to take her place, as he is accused because of her. This is his right according to the tradition of Oldshore. Aldorion doesn't want to, but she makes him understand that she must show the way to the Faithful and not him. She submits to the trial and the sea-worm does not devour her, but throws her back on the beach. She is innocent, a woman then chants the name of Tar-Míriel, Queen of the Sea, to the great disappointment of Ar-Pharazôn.

Ar-Pharazôn is in trouble. He accuses Míriel of having used the magic of her supposed ally Malachar to pass the Trial by Abyss. All of the Faithful are considered traitors and arrested by the guards. Aldorion escapes them thanks to his daughter Eärien and goes to the queen regent to get her to leave the city. Míriel refuses to leave. She gives the captain of the sword Starshatter as a gift and asks him to flee to the west of the island. After Aldorion leaves, Míriel is arrested and taken in handcuffs before the king.
