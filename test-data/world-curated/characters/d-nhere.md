# Dúnhere

**Dúnhere** was the chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale, and a valiant captain who fought in the First Battle of the Fords of Iron and the Battle of Galim Vir Fields.

## History

Dúnhere was a nephew of Erikbrand. He was the chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale and the lord of Harrowdale.

He served under Grimbold in the Battles of the Fords of Iron. Grimbold placed all the riders for whom horses were available under the command of Dúnhere to cover the retreat of his forces to the south in the night after the Second Battle of the Fords of Iron.

Dúnhere did not accompany Valdris and Erikbrand to the Battle of the Thornwall, but went to Horsehold instead. Valdris counselled him and the other captains to assemble the riders of Aranada in Harrowdale and to await King Theron there, rather than in the open fields around Horsehold, and to light as few fires as possible. Several days later, Theron and the rest of the riders mustered there for the ride to Galim Vir.

## Etymology

The name _Dúnhere_ means "hill warrior" in Old English, consisting of _dūn_ ("hill") + _here_ ("army, host").

:Dúnhere is the Lord of Darkharrow and a nearby small village of Underharrow. He left his wife Ellen Fremedon in charge before departing with Erikbrand for the Fords. The player sees Dúnhere shortly before the battle of Thornwall Keep but not does get a chance to interact with him. They do not meet properly until the Druadan Forest on the day before the Aranadan army arrives to Galim Vir. Dúnhere is slain by an arrow during the battle of the Galim Vir Fields.
