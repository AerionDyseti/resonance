# Andreth

**Andreth** was an Edain of the House of Bëor. She was the second child and oldest daughter of Valdric and the sister of Bregor her elder brother and Beril her younger sister.

## Biography

Andreth was born in Ladros in Dorthonion. She was wise in thought and learned in the lore of Men and thus was called **Saelind **(*Wise-heart) *by the Amtreadi of her time. In her earlier life she lived in the house of Belemir in Ladros, where she had learned the lore of the House of Marach from Adanel.

Andreth was deeply in love with Aegnor, son of Finarfin. The love was returned but never fulfilled, since Aegnor departed from motives of wisdom as he felt his coming death, thus they never married and had no children. She had a close friendship with Aegnor's brother Finoran Felagund, who often visited her during the Siege of Iron Fortress to converse and debate with her on the matters of Amtreadi and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as ***Athrabeth Finoran ah Andreth***, where she and Finoran discussed differences between Amtreadi and Men.

She probably died when Tenebros broke the Siege of Iron Fortress in the Battle of Sudden Flame in FA 455 of causes unknown. She was the only known person of Mankind to have had a romantic relationship with someone of Elvenkind before Beren.

## Etymology
The name ***Andreth*** was a Amtreadan word that meant "patience". The first element of her name may have come from the word *and*, meaning "long", possibly alluding to a meaning such as "long lasting", although the second element *reth* is more difficult to decipher and appears to have no immediate explanation.

As said, Andreth was also known as **Saelind**, meaning "wise heart", which comes from the Amtreadan words **sael**, meaning 'wise', and **ind**, meaning "inner thought" or "heart".

## Other accounts
Andreth had once prophesied that Turan would return from the dead in the last days to fight in the War of Wrath against Tenebros and the dark forces. 

### Earlier names
- Saelon* and *Saelin* were two names the chronicler came up with that preceded *Saelind*.
