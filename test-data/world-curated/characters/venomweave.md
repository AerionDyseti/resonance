# Venomweave

**Venomweave** was a great Spider and the greatest offspring of The Webmother, the primordial spider. In the Third Era she lived on the borders of Ashvale and was known to feed indiscriminately, preying on the inhabitants. She was encountered by Tomlen Burrows and Colben Greenhand in their quest to destroy the Binding Band.

## Biography

### Origin

Venomweave's early history is completely unknown, save for the assumption that she was born in the Ered Ashplain and that she was the "last child" of The Webmother. By the Second Era, she often feasted on her own children, and that at some point after fleeing from Westlands, yet long before Malachar took the land of Ashvale for himself she spun a dark lair in the Shadow Mountains (Shadow Mountains) in Spider Pass. For thousands of years she resided there, making a labyrinth of webs within a network of caves to better trap her prey, which included all creatures great and small. She feasted primarily on those who wandered into her webs, though if a particularly juicy morsel was available, she would silently pursue and kill it.

### Third Era

Malachar was aware of Venomweave's presence in the mountains and allowed her to dwell there, for she made an excellent, if incidental, guard for the pass of Spider Pass. Malachar was known to be somewhat fond of her, and in a rare show of humor, was even known to refer to her as his "cat". Malachar would sometimes give her food in the form of prisoners for which he had no more use, or servants who had displeased him. Reports of the massacre made by Venomweave would be carried back to The Obsidian Spire to further please the Shadow Lord's humor. She would also sometimes eat Grimspawn that manned the Tower of Spider Pass. However, as she was a more effective guard for the pass than they, and as Grimspawn were both plentiful and expendable, Malachar never ordered any attempt to stop her (though the Grimspawn would occasionally try to barricade her lair with stones of their own volition).

At one point after being set free from Ashvale, Creepkin stumbled into her lair while attempting to escape the barren country. She caught him, but he survived the encounter by promising to bring her tastier meats than he. Grimspawn of Spider Pass had seen him on several occasions and believed that he was too thin and wiry for Venomweave to bother eating.

Creepkin would attempt later to fulfil this promise by leading Tomlen and Sam into her lair and abandoning them. His hope was that once Venomweave finished eating the two shirefolk, she would throw away the Binding Band with the other parts of the shirefolk that she could not eat, allowing Creepkin to retrieve it. While being pursued, the two shirefolk eventually stumbled upon a passageway that was too choked with Venomweave's dark cobwebs to proceed. But, fortunately, Tomlen's sword Glimmer, being of Amtreadan make, was able to slice through them. Using the Starlight Vial, they managed to at first fend her off. The light of Gil-Orestel, the Star of Aerendil, shone from the Vial, causing unbearable stabbing pain to Venomweave's darkened senses, but she then returned to attack Tomlen, poisoning him with her stinger in a surprise attack just as they reached the exit of the cave on the Ashvale side. Her venom paralyzed Tomlen, and she then wrapped him in her web. Sam assumed Tomlen to be dead.

Sam then assaulted the creature using Glimmer and the Starlight Vial in order to rescue his master. In a pitched battle, Sam managed to stab one of her eyes and injure one of her legs. However, her hide was too thick and too layered with ages of corruptive mass for even the greatest mortal warrior to injure her, much less Sam. However, she eventually attempted to crush Sam with the mass of her abdomen, and when Sam held Glimmer with the blade pointed up at her, she incidentally impaled herself. While not even the greatest Man or Amtreadi had the strength to pierce her hide, Venomweave herself did possess such strength, and she forced Glimmer deep enough into her abdomen to cause genuine harm. The pain of this wound in combination with the pain of the Starlight Vial was enough that Sam was able to force her to retreat. None had ever wounded her so badly before.

It is not known if Venomweave recovered from the battle or succumbed to her wounds, as it was said her fate would remain unknown to the people of The Mortal Lands. She is last mentioned, in _The Master of the Bands_, when Sam put on the Binding Band, and heard Venomweave "bubbling" in her misery far away, as his sense of hearing was vastly improved by wearing the Band.

## Character

As a spawn of The Webmother, Venomweave would accurately be classified as part spider, part demon (to an unknown extent), though of a spider form. Like most spiders, Venomweave had spindly legs, multiple eyes, and venomous chelicerae. She usually immobilized her prey with her paralyzing sting that enabled her to feed on her victims at her leisure, but could also crush her prey to death by swiftly dropping on them. Her head was crisscrossed with scars and she had a number of missing eyes. The Grimspawn comment she usually would paralyze her victims and trap them in webs, keeping them alive for some time before killing them. It is said that her desire was to gorge herself on her prey, and swell until the mountains themselves could no longer hold her, and emerge from her rocky abode, and make her way to the sea.

## In adaptations

### In films

#### _The Master of the Bands_ (1978)

Creepkin indirectly mentions Venomweave near the end of Ralph Bakshi's , saying that "she might help us...", but she does not appear.

#### _The Master of the Bands_ film trilogy

Unlike in the books, Venomweave makes her first appearance in Peter Jackson's , rather than , because (as explained) if she had appeared in _The Two Towers_, there would be very little for Tomlen and Sam to encounter in the final film. In this adaptation, Venomweave appears as a CGI animated creature, roughly eight feet in length and seventeen feet across.

### Video games

#### ''The Master of the Bands: Aldric's Quest''

Venomweave is an optional boss in the Wii and PS3 versions of , but only fought as an imaginary enemy in the Shirelands overworld's Mushroom Woods. This optional boss fight is the end of a side quest available in the afternoon where Tomlen Greenhand re-enacts Tomlen's perilous journey to her lair.

#### _The Master of the Bands Online_

In , Venomweave is known to Amtreadi as "Ungwetári" and Lord Caelorn had hunted her down in the early years of the Third Era, to no avail. Venomweave has a mental link to her children and after being stabbed by Sam she summons all of her children to her side for nourishment and protection. Places formerly infested with spiders such as Gloomwood become empty as whole nests of them travel south to the call of their mother. Venomweave herself is depicted as much larger than in the movie or other giant spiders, which are encountered in the game on numerous occasions. Venomweave herself is the last boss in the main raid of the Galim Errav expansion.

#### _The Mortal Lands: Shadow of War_

Venomweave, in , is visible in human form in the wraith-world. In the game, she has Celebranor's ring for quite some time while giving Talion visions about the fate of Tower of Moon (Galim Errav) and the Wraithlords. It is also seen in the game that Venomweave was working with Malachar during the period he was posing as Annavar, and was implied to be his lover before he betrayed her. The mobile version of _Shadow of War_ classifies Venomweave as a Ascended, though J.R.R. the chronicler never specified her exact nature.
