# Yavanna

**Yavanna** (High Amtreadan; IPA:  - "Giver of Fruits") was of the Firstborn and The Pantheon, and one of the Aratar who was responsible for the growth of all the fruits and growing things of The World. She was also called **Kementári** (High Amtreadan; IPA: "Queen of the Earth"), **Ivon** (Amtreadan; IPA: "Giver of Fruits"). She resided in the Pastures of Yavanna, in the south of The Blessed Realm.

She was the wife of Aulë, older sister of Vána.

## Biography
In the Music of the Firstborn, Yavanna sang of branches of great trees that would receive the rain of Manwë and Ulmo, and some trees sang to Ilúvatar. This is said to be the conception of the Shepherds of the Trees. Her thought also met with Manwë's, setting the arrival of the Skywardens.

Beginning in the Days before days during the Spring of The World, she planted and caused to grow the first growing things of the world Olvar (trees and plants), which she had long prepared. At first, just as every other thing in the world that the The Pantheon nurtured and cared for, these things prospered and thrived for a time. Tenebros, however, had his own plans and they involved taking the world from his brethren and ruling it for himself. From his great fortress of First Darkness in the far north, he sent forth his poisons into the veins of the world blighting the Spring of The World. Then the things of Yavanna fell sick and rotted and soon after Tenebros assaulted and destroyed the Two Lamps, breaking the world.

After the destruction of the Two Lamps the The Pantheon withdrew to The Far West and created The Blessed Realm. Upon the green mound of Ezellohar, Yavanna sat and sang while the other The Pantheon sat and listened. Her song, with the aid of the tears of Nienna brought forth the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm, her greatest creation, which gave light to the land. The Mortal Lands was left in darkness and Yavanna put a sleep upon all the plant and animal life. However, Yavanna did not forsake the Outer Lands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Tenebros and urged the other The Pantheon to wage war on him before the Awakening of the Amtreadi.

After Eru allowed Aulë's creations, the Forgekin, to survive, Yavanna feared that they would cut down all the trees in The Mortal Lands. Aulë, in reply, told her that even Amtreadi and Men, the true Children of Ilúvatar would have need of her trees as well. Yavanna lamented to Manwë, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others. Manwë brought her concerns before Ilúvatar in prayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea by creating the Treewardens to protect the trees.

After the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains and told the other The Pantheon that if she could use the light of the Starstones she could heal them. This light she was denied by the will of Faenor. Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from Laurelin. She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the Moon and the Sun to give light to all of The World.

For the Men who had stood with the The Pantheon in the War of Wrath the land of Andor was raised by Ossë, established by Aulë, and enriched by Yavanna. When the Edain came to this island they created the realm of Oldshore. In the later centuries, when the The Pantheon decided to send emissaries to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Ascended Curumo to take her servant, Aiwendil, with him.

## Etymology
In High Amtreadan, ***Yavanna*** means "Giver of Fruits", from *yáve* ("fruit") and *anna* ("gift"). **Kementári**, her epithet, means "Queen of the Earth", from *kemen* ("the Earth") and *tari* ("Queen").

Her name in Amtreadan is **Ivon**, meaning "Giver of Fruits". It is only attested in the compound *Ivonwin* ("Maidens of Yavanna"). The month *Ivanneth* may have been named after Yavanna.

### Earlier names
***Palúrien*** was an earlier name for Yavanna. It means "Lady of the Wide Earth."

## Ascended of Yavanna
-  Aiwendil (Thornwick), who was sent as one of the *Greycloaks* to help the Free People of The Mortal Lands against Malachar. However, he at least failed his mission, preferring to protect the flora and fauna of The Mortal Lands.
-  Melian is said to be kin to Yavanna, but wasn't considered a maiden of the "Queen of the Earth". She served instead both Vána, the sister of Yavanna, and Estë.

## Other versions
In other versions of the legendarium, Aulë and Yavanna were the parents of Oromë and Nessa and Lëa-vinya and Gwendeling were Ascended of Yavanna. Furthermore, instead of Yavanna, in a few other versions, it was her sister Vána that made Laurelin bear its last fruit.

## Trivia
-  She is ranked fourth among the Aratar (eight most powerful of the The Pantheon) and second among the Valier (ladies of the The Pantheon).
-  Yavanna shares similarities with the classical goddesses: Demeter, associated with crop growth and fertility, and Gaia, also known as "Mother Earth".
