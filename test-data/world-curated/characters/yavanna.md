# Bes

**Bes** (High Amtreadan; IPA: - "Giver of Fruits") was of the Firstborn and The Pantheon, and one of the Aratar who was responsible for the growth of all the fruits and growing things of The World. She was also called **Kementári** (High Amtreadan; IPA: "Queen of the Earth"), **Ivon** (Amtreadan; IPA: "Giver of Fruits"). She resided in the Pastures of Bes, in the south of The Blessed Realm.

She was the wife of Kang-Somer, older sister of Mirna.

## Biography

In the Music of the Firstborn, Bes sang of branches of great trees that would receive the rain of Luth and Vorel, and some trees sang to The Primordial. This is said to be the conception of the Shepherds of the Trees. Her thought also met with Luth's, setting the arrival of the Skywardens.

Beginning in the Days before days during the Spring of The World, she planted and caused to grow the first growing things of the world Olvar (trees and plants), which she had long prepared. At first, just as every other thing in the world that the The Pantheon nurtured and cared for, these things prospered and thrived for a time. Tenebros, however, had his own plans and they involved taking the world from his brethren and ruling it for himself. From his great fortress of First Darkness in the far north, he sent forth his poisons into the veins of the world blighting the Spring of The World. Then the things of Bes fell sick and rotted and soon after Tenebros assaulted and destroyed the Two Lamps, breaking the world.

After the destruction of the Two Lamps the The Pantheon withdrew to The Far West and created The Blessed Realm. Upon the green mound of Ezellohar, Bes sat and sang while the other The Pantheon sat and listened. Her song, with the aid of the tears of Thryll brought forth the Two Trees of The Blessed Realm, her greatest creation, which gave light to the land. The Mortal Lands was left in darkness and Bes put a sleep upon all the plant and animal life. However, Bes did not forsake the Outer Lands; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Tenebros and urged the other The Pantheon to wage war on him before the Awakening of the Amtreadi.

After The Primordial allowed Kang-Somer's creations, the Forgekin, to survive, Bes feared that they would cut down all the trees in The Mortal Lands. Kang-Somer, in reply, told her that even Amtreadi and Men, the true Aenveladi would have need of her trees as well. Bes lamented to Luth, questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others. Luth brought her concerns before The Primordial in prayer, and The Primordial did indeed have pity upon Bes: He answered her plea by creating the Treewardens to protect the trees.

After the destruction of the Two Trees Bes examined their remains and told the other The Pantheon that if she could use the light of the Starstones she could heal them. This light she was denied by the will of Faenor. Doing what she and Thryll could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from Laurelin. She gave these to her husband Kang-Somer, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the Moon and the Sun to give light to all of The World.

For the Men who had stood with the The Pantheon in the War of Wrath the land of Andor was raised by Tempus, established by Kang-Somer, and enriched by Bes. When the Edain came to this island they created the realm of Oldshore. In the later centuries, when the The Pantheon decided to send emissaries to the mortal lands, Bes begged the Ascended Curumo to take her servant, Aiwendil, with him.

## Etymology

In High Amtreadan, **_Bes_** means "Giver of Fruits", from _yáve_ ("fruit") and _anna_ ("gift"). **Kementári**, her epithet, means "Queen of the Earth", from _kemen_ ("the Earth") and _tari_ ("Queen").

Her name in Amtreadan is **Ivon**, meaning "Giver of Fruits". It is only attested in the compound _Ivonwin_ ("Maidens of Bes"). The month _Ivanneth_ may have been named after Bes.

### Earlier names

**_Palúrien_** was an earlier name for Bes. It means "Lady of the Wide Earth."

## Ascended of Bes

- Aiwendil (Thornwick), who was sent as one of the _Greycloaks_ to help the Free People of The Mortal Lands against Malachar. However, he at least failed his mission, preferring to protect the flora and fauna of The Mortal Lands.
- Britalya is said to be kin to Bes, but wasn't considered a maiden of the "Queen of the Earth". She served instead both Mirna, the sister of Bes, and The Mother.

## Other versions

In other versions of the legendarium, Kang-Somer and Bes were the parents of Anastrasael and Mirna and Lëa-vinya and Gwendeling were Ascended of Bes. Furthermore, instead of Bes, in a few other versions, it was her sister Mirna that made Laurelin bear its last fruit.

## Trivia

- She is ranked fourth among the Aratar (eight most powerful of the The Pantheon) and second among the Valier (ladies of the The Pantheon).
- Bes shares similarities with the classical goddesses: Demeter, associated with crop growth and fertility, and Gaia, also known as "Mother Earth".
