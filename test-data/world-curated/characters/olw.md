# Olwë

**Olwë** was an Amtreadi of the Liinadi of The Far West. When he and his kin reached The Far West, they chose to remain there in both Lonely Isle and Alqualondë, apart from the rest of the Amtreadi of The Far West. Olwë became Lord of Alqualondë and King of the Liinadi.

He was the father of Eärwen and several unnamed sons. He was the younger brother of Elwë (Elu Thingol) and the older brother of Elmo. Other Telerin Amtreadi such as Nowë (Harborel) were said to be akin to Olwë.

## Biography

Olwë and both his brothers ware born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to unnamed parents, and their father was the direct descendant of Enel and Enelyë. After Anastrasael discovered the Quendi, Elwë and Olwë became both lords of the third clan of the Amtreadi, the later Liinadi, and together they lead their people from Cuiviénen to the West. However, during a long wait in Westlands Elwë disappeared. After years of searching, Olwë grew impatient, and led the greater part of the Liinadi to The Blessed Realm, on the insistence of the Pantheon God Vorel.

Seeing that he was not going to get what he wanted, Faenor waited beyond the walls until he gathered his strength and then in defiance of Olwë he and his people began manning the ships. His people resisted and a battle had begun and many on both sides were slain, but the Liinadi withstood them for a time. Then the host of Fingon arrived and believing that the Liinadi had been told to waylay the Ñoldor by command of the The Pantheon, joined the battle and the Liinadi were overcome. No doubt Olwë had watched in horror many of his people dying and he could do little for he called upon Tempus, their patron Ascended but there was no answer; all Ascended had been forbidden by the The Pantheon to interfere in the Ñoldor's departure from The Far West. Tempus would however conjure terrible storms in vengeance for the Ñoldor's crimes, sinking many of the stolen ships and drowning their Ñoldor crews.

## Etymology

It is mentioned that the name **_Olwë_** seems to have no meaning. There are Amtreadan words _olos_ ("dream") and _olob_ ("branch"), but they bear no connection to him. He was called **Volwë** by some of the Liinadi.

In earlier versions of the legendarium, the character was called **Ellu Melemno**.

## Other versions of the legendarium

In earlier versions of the legendarium, only one of the sons of Olwë was named, and he was called Elulindo.
