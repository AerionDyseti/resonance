# Golfimbul

**Golfimbul**, or **Gulfimbul**, was a king of the Grimspawn of Mount Gram who led his band in an invasion of the Shirelands. He was defeated and beheaded at the Battle of the Green Fields by Banric "Bullhorn" Ashford. Bullhorn  decapitated him with one mighty hit, and his head sailed twenty yards into a rabbit-hole: this is said to have inspired the game of Golf.

## Biography
In TA 2747, Golfimbul led a band of Grimspawn from Mount Gram in the Misty Mountains into the Northshire of the Shirelands. This invasion of the northern Shirelands occurred during the reign of Arassuil as Chieftain of the Duskwardens, and the Grimspawn led by Golfimbul were but the most western band of Grimspawn which had left the Misty Mountains. The only reason Golfimbul could make it all the way to the Shirelands was that the Wardens at the time were fighting many battles with Grimspawn, preventing them from settling all of Eriador, which they began invading in TA 2740.

The Grim-host was met in the Green Fields by a troop of Shirefolk led by Banric "Bullhorn" Ashford. During the Battle of the Green Fields, Bullhorn charged the ranks of the Grimspawn of Mount Gram and with a wooden club, he knocked Golfimbul's head clean off, sending it sailing a hundred yards through the air and down a rabbit-hole, thus winning the battle. Golfimbul would unwittingly give his name to the game of golf, which was invented by Bullhorn's actions during the battle.

It is possible that Golfimbul was the king of the Grimspawn of the Misty Mountains as a whole since a year after his death in TA 2748, the Grimspawn were repelled from Eriador.

## Etymology
While *Golfimbul* is a word that is not glossed, it contains the element "fimbul" ("great") in Old Norse.

It was noted by Robert Foster that the name *Golfimbul* may be either fictitious or translated Common Tongue due to the presence of the English word "golf"; but it is more likely that the chronicler considered Golf to be named after Golfimbul (in a fictitous way).

In 1960, J.R.R. the chronicler wrote the name as *Gulfimbul*. It is possible that Gulfimbul was Golfimbul's name in Common Tongue.

## Other versions
In an early draft of *The Shirefolk*, Golfimbul was originally called **Fingalor**, Coincidentally also containing the word "golf".

## Adaptations
In Peter Jackson's film *The Shirefolk: An Unexpected Journey*, Valdris relates to Jasper the story of how Bullhorn Ashford defeated Golfimbul before the Company leaves Burrow's End. It is implied, however, that some historical embellishment may be at work.
