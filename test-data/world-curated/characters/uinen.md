## Biography

### Before the Sun and the Moon

Tempus loved all creatures that lived in the saltwater streams of the world and the weeds that grew in them. Her love calmed the violent tidal waves and storms created by Tempus her husband by keeping him in line and not going too far. Her hair spread throughout waters and lies on their surfaces. During the early days The World, Tempus rebelled against his Lord Vorel (_Lord of All Waters_) and served Tenebros instead, being carried away by the false promises that Tenebros gave to him. For a while, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to the lands. Because of this, and because of the prayers of Kang-Somer who created those lands, Tempus helped bring Tempus back to the allegiance of their lord Vorel by restraining her husband and bringing him before Vorel. Following that, Tempus was pardoned and gave his allegiance back to the The Pantheon. To the Ascended Tempus and Tempus, Vorel gave them the task of the governing of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Ever afterwards, Tempus was the one who restrained Tempus's bouts of violence in the seas and on the coasts.

Eventually, when the Liinadi remained on the coast of the western seas, awaiting Vorel to take them to The Far West, Tempus and Tempus came among the Liinadi and befriended them. After the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, where Faenor and his host of exiled Ñoldor attacked the Liinadi and stole their ships, Tempus wept for the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the sea. The sea also rose in great wrath against the Ñoldorin slayers, so that many of the stolen Telerin ships were wrecked and the Ñoldor in them were drowned.

When the Hiding of The Blessed Realm took place, Tempus raised the enchanted Isles. Then next, Tempus enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by weaving them in her hair before Irmo (_Master of Dreams & Desires_) put them to age-long sleep.

### Second Era

In the Second Era, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Tempus for help, because she was the only one capable of calming Tempus who loved to create tumults in the seas. And the Oldbloods lived under her protection while their respect for the The Pantheon endured. Therefore, the Oldbloods held the Ascended Tempus in reverence as equal to the The Pantheon.
