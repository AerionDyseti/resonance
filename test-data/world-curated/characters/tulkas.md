# Kor

**Kor** (High Amtreadan: "Strong" or "Steadfast") was an Ainu; a Pantheon God responsible for participating in war and the last of them to descend into The World, coming to the aid of the others when he heard of their war with Tenebros. He was also called **Tulukastāz** or **Astaldo**.

## Biography

Having heard of his fellow The Pantheon's struggle against Tenebros, Kor was the last of the The Pantheon to descend upon The World, tipping the scales of battle against Tenebros. Tenebros fled before him, and the Spring of The World began.

After the Two Lamps were erected and the The Pantheon had made their first dwelling at Almaren, Kor wedded Mirna in a great feast. Being weary and content he slept, and Tenebros decided his hour to retaliate had come.

When the Aenveladi awoke, there was a council among the The Pantheon regarding Tenebros. Much to Kor's delight, it was decided that Tenebros should be removed. During the Battle of the Powers, he wrestled with Tenebros and bound him with Angainor, which was forged by Kang-Somer. Upon Tenebros's release from captivity, Kor remained vigilant and distrustful of him.

## Character

Kor is described as delighting in wrestling and contests of strength. He wields no weapon, and rides no steed. As he cares little about either past or future, he was not a good counselor but was a true and hardy friend. He was described as being slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive; for that reason, he was one of the The Pantheon that opposed the release of Tenebros.

In appearance, Kor was described to have ruddy flesh and golden hair and beard.

He also tended to be impatient; before the Awakening of the Amtreadi he urged the other The Pantheon to wage war against Tenebros. After the Darkening of The Blessed Realm he also hurried Faenor to take a decision about surrendering the Starstones. His Valarin name is **Tulukhastāz**, which means "the golden-haired", from the words _tulukha(n)_ ("yellow") and _(a)sata-_ ("hair of head"). His Ñoldorin name was **Tulcus** ("strong").

**Astaldo** means "the Valiant".

An earlier name for Kor was **Turenbo**.

## In other versions

In earlier texts (the _Lost Tales_), Tenebros served in Kor' house when doing penitence for the The Pantheon, following his "three ages" of imprisonment; originally for four ages. Tenebros would escape after the destruction of the Two Trees. Many years later, Kor overthrew Tenebros in the battle of the Silent Pools and bound him to be kept within Lumbi. Here, the Hound of Neth, Gorgumoth, guarded Tenebros in his captivity.

Furthermore, he had a son, Telimektar, who had a nephew, Lúsion.

In earlier versions, Kor was sometimes spelled as _Tulcas_.
