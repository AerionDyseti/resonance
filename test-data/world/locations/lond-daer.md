# Lond Daer

**Lond Daer Enedh** (also spelt **Ened**) was a great harbour in Eriador founded by the Númenóreans.

## History
Originally, the harbour, under the name ***Vinyalondë***, or "New Haven", was founded by Númenor's crown prince Aldarion on the estuary of the river Gwathló, between  and .

The Númenórean hunger for ever more wealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south, Pelargir and Umbar. Following this, the haven was one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as Lond Daer Enedh, or "Great Middle Haven", between the Grey Havens and Pelargir. Despite this, Númenor still maintained traffic on the Gwathló as far as the city of Tharbad, and Lond Daer was expanded and fortified.

After the Downfall of Númenor, Elendil founded the realm of Arnor in the lands north of Lond Daer which was still part of the most safe and efficient route between the Realms in Exile by sea, in connection with Tharbad and the Great Road; but as Lond Daer fell into ruin, Tharbad succeeded it in importance. clearly composed of *lond* ("haven"), *daer* ("great, large") and *enedh* ("middle").
