# Calembel

**Calembel** was a town in the region of Lamedon in northern Gondor. It was located on a small hill near the road between Erech and Pelargir, near the fords of the river Ciril.

## History
On 9 March , Aragorn, the Grey Company and the Army of the Dead departed from Erech, crossed the fords over the river Ciril and arrived at Calembel. The fords over the river Ciril and the town of Calembel were deserted, because many men had gone to fight in the War of the Ring and the remaining population had fled to the hills after they heard a rumour that the King of the Dead was coming. It means "Greenham". Paul Strack and David Salo suggest that it is a compound of *calen* ("green") and the lenited form *bel* of *pêl* ("fenced field", "fence").

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2014: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Calembel is the seat of Lord Angbor, who was charged by Prince Imrahil with protecting the land from the Corsairs of Umbar when the other Lords of Gondor rode to the defence of Minas Tirith. Deciding to make a stand against the Corsairs in Linhir, Angbor left his son Drambor in charge of Calembel, which served as a refuge for inhabitants of the nearby village of Lothgobel when it was attacked by the Corsairs.
