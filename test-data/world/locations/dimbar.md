# Dimbar

## History

Dimbar was still empty and seemingly at peace even after the ravages of the Dagor Bragollach, possibly due to the watchfulness of the Men of Brethil. Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Huor and Húrin, both very young at the time, became lost in this land after a fight with Orcs, but were both rescued by Thorondor and his Great Eagles and taken to Gondolin. But after the losses of the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Dimbar became infested with Orcs, leading the Men of Brethil and the Sindar Elves of Doriath under their valiant captains Túrin and Beleg Cúthalion to mount many daring raids against them.

When Túrin exiled himself from Doriath, Dimbar was overrun by Orcs coming from Taur-nu-Fuin threatening Brethil and Beleg went in search of Túrin to urge him to return to help rid the land of Orcs. Túrin refused choosing to remain an outlaw. During their journey to Gondolin, Tuor and the Elf Voronwë camped near Dimbar in a shallow cave on a hillside that overlooked it.

Dimbar was cold and desolate when Húrin came there not long after being released from Angband, seeking Gondolin.
