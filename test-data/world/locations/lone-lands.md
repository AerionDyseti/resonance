# Lone-lands

The **Lone-lands** was an area of Middle-earth which was either located in the region of Eriador or was synonymous with its names.

## History
The "Lone-lands" was a name used by Hobbits, and possibly the Men of Bree, for the wilderness found east of Bree.

The eastern end of the area towards Hoarwell was described as being bare and stony, whereas the western end towards the South Downs appeared to be fuller of bushy thickets.

Among other features, the Lone-lands contained Weathertop Hill and the Weather Hills, and in the hilly portion of the area were many abandoned castles of Rhudaur, which, according to some, gave it a "wicked" look. Also, roads were considerably worse in the Lone-lands than in the Shire, and by the conclusion of the Third Age, very few resided here.

## Ambiguity
Whether the Lone-lands and Eriador are synonymous with each other is unknown; although etymologies given for Eriador certainly suggests that this may be the case. Both mentions of "Lone-lands" in *The Hobbit* were not added until the 1966 edition, well after the introduction of the word "Eriador" in J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Fellowship of the Ring*. Seeing as the latter was spoken by Aragorn, who would have known the Sindarin name, and the former by Bilbo, who would not have known the "foreign" name at the time, it is likely they were referring to the same region.

## In adaptations
### ''J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth*
The "Lone-lands" is a name given to an area south of Weathertop Hill.

### *The Hobbit* (2003 video game)
When Thorin and Company travel from Hobbiton to the Trollshaws, the narrator mentions the "Lone-lands".

The game's soundtrack also contains a piece called "Combat in the Lone-lands," which is played as Bilbo journeys to the campfire of the Trolls.

### *The Lord of the Rings Online*
In the game ,'' the "lLone-lands" refers explicitly to the region between Bree-land and the Trollshaws. The Forsaken Inn in the far west, and the Last Bridge at the far east are the region's boundaries.
