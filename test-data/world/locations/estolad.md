# Estolad

**Estolad** was a wide plain in East Beleriand. 

It lay south of the forest of Nan Elmoth and west of Thargelion between the rivers Celon and Gelion. It was ruled for a time by Amrod and Amras, the youngest sons of Fëanor.

## History

The people of Bëor first journeyed to Estolad on the advice of Finrod Felagund, who often returned to visit them there; though Bëor went to Nargothrond with Felagund and returned never to Estolad. The Laegeldrim of Ossiriand had sent word to Felagund begging him to remove the Men from their lands. When the Haladin came later over the Blue Mountains, they encountered hostility from the Laegeldrim and entered Thargelion, in the land of Caranthir. They came to Estolad only after the loss of their lord Haldad in battle with the Orcs. The people of Marach came up the Dwarf-road to Estolad a year after Bëor's folk, and there the friendship between those houses was enriched.

Many Elves journeyed to Estolad to first see the Atani, the Second People. In turn, many young men went away to enter the service of Elven Kings. Among the renowned Elf-friends who left Estolad with the Elves were Malach and and Baran son of Bëor. These alliances led to the eventual departure of the Edain north to Dor-lómin and Ladros.

## Etymology
