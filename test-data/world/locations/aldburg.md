**Aldburg** was a fortified town in Rohan, situated on a green hill at the feet of the White Mountains in the region known as the Folde. Originally the first capital of the kingdom of Rohan, it later became the base of the Third Marshal of the Riddermark and the Muster of the East-mark.

'*2013: *The Lord of the Rings Online'''''
:Aldburg is the capital town of the Eastfold, ruled by Éomer in times of peace. After Éomer departed for war, the defence of Aldburg fell to his steward Arcil, who often  disagreed with Éomer's cousin, Éothain.

Aldburg serves as the in-game "capital settlement" of the West Rohan region, functioning as the hub for swift travel and player activities after Edoras is evacuated early in the game and its inhabitants move to Dunharrow.
