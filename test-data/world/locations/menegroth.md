# Menegroth

**Menegroth**, the **Thousand Caves**, was the city in the land of Doriath which was home to king Thingol of the Sindarin elves and queen Melian, one of the Maiar, during the First Age. It was the location of the Menelrond, the hall where Thingol's Throne was situated.

=History=
## Years of the Trees
During the ages of the Chaining of Melkor, the Sindar had lived scattered in Beleriand, some at the havens of the Falas, others in the woodlands of Region and Neldoreth where also their King Thingol and his queen Melian abode. When the third Age of Melkor's chaining began, Melian urged Thingol to build a fast place for their people. Thingol was on friendly terms with the Dwarves and he commissioned the Dwarves of Belegost to aid with the building of a fortress.

Much after the manner of the Dwarves they delved an underground fortress into a rocky hill on the banks of Esgalduin, where the river turned to the west. The only entrance were gates high above the river, that at this place ran in a deep ravine and was crossed by a stone bridge. The place was thereafter known as Menegroth, the Thousand Caves, because so many were the halls the Dwarves had hewn out of the rock.

After the First Battle of Beleriand, many Elves who had not lived in the cities fled to Doriath, which was afterwards protected by the Girdle of Melian.

## Years of the Sun
Menegroth and Doriath enjoyed peace for a long time. Thingol preferred a policy of isolationism and not to mingle in the affairs of the Noldor, the War of the Jewels and the conflict with Morgoth in general. No host of Doriath participated in any of the great battles, except the First. Only with his kin in Nargothrond did Thingol remain in contact.

Yet Menegroth also became entangled in the fate of the Silmaril and thus the Oath of Fëanor and the Doom of Mandos. When the man Beren asked for the hand of Thingol's daughter Lúthien in marriage, Thingol was affronted, thinking little of mortal men. As a bride price he demanded that Beren should bring one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown.

With the help of Lúthien, Beren succeeded, but the price was high: Carcharoth, the wolf who was guarding the Gates of Angband, bit off the hand in which Beren was holding the Silmaril. Driven mad by the pain that the hallowed stone caused to him, searing his intestines, Carcharoth ravaged Beleriand and finally broke through Melian's Girdle, threatening Menegroth. He was confronted somewhat to the north-east from the city at the banks of Esgalduin and killed by Huan the Great Hound of Valinor, having wounded Beren mortally. The Silmaril was found in his stomach and thus found its way to Menegroth.

News of the event spread fast and the Dwarves were hunted and slain. Two of them escaped and told a crooked tale about how they were betrayed and their brethren slaughtered by the Elves. The Dwarves of Nogrod rose in anger and mustered a great army. Doriath lay open to their onslaught; the Girdle was gone since Melian, in deep sorrow for her husband's death, had left Middle-earth.

In the earlier *Etymologies*, Tolkien explains the word is of Doriathrin language and gives the final element as Doriathrin *roth*.

In a text about Elvish nomenclatures, Tolkien used the form ***Menegrond*** a couple of times, which according to Carl F. Hostetter, it may be a Sindarin form of the Doriathrin classical form *Menegroth*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest version of the legendarium, *The Book of Lost Tales*, the dwelling of Thingol (then called Tinwelint) was a "rugged cave," and Tinwelint admits to his lack of wealth. By the time *The Lay of the Children of Húrin* and *The Lay of Leithian* were written Thingol's dwelling had great hoards of wealth. By the late 1920s his abode had come to be called "The Thousand Caves," and by the early 1930s the name *Menegroth* had emerged.
