# Dagorlad

**Dagorlad** was a vast plain in southwestern Rhovanion, near Mordor, in Middle-earth.

Dagorlad lay between the Emyn Muil and the Cirith Gorgor, and was largely a treeless wasteland, bereft of life and beauty.

## History

Dagorlad was the location of the Battle of Dagorlad, fought there between Sauron's forces and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men at the end of the Second Age. The bodies of the dead decayed as normal, but over time part of the field became a wetland, the Dead Marshes, where the images of the fallen could be seen. Later, in the Third Age, the Dagorlad was the site of many battles between Gondor and various Easterling armies. The countless battles of two ages left Dagorlad as a devastated wasteland, contaminated and unhealthy, with sumps of poisonous slick and mounds of scorched earth.

The Battle of Dagorlad occurred in the year 3434 of the Second Age. It was fought between the army of the Last Alliance under Gil-galad and Elendil and an army of Orcs with other creatures loyal to Sauron. It is unknown how long it lasted, but ultimately the Last Alliance won the battle and proceeded into Mordor.

The Second Battle of Dagorlad was fought in TA 1899 between the army of King Calimehtar of Gondor and the Wainriders. The result was a victory for Gondor.

## Etymology

The word ***Dagorlad*** means 'battle plain' in the Sindarin language, from *dagor,* meaning *battle*, and *lad,* meaning *plain.*

## Notes

In Peter Jackson's movie adaptation of the *The* *Lord of the Rings* film trilogy, Dagorlad is misspelled as Dagorland on various maps shown in the films, and in the appendices of the special extended DVD editions.
