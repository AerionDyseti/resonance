# Newbury

**Newbury** was a town in the north-eastern Buckland, to the north of Crickhollow and next to the High Hay.

## Etymology
- Bury*, from the Old English *burh*, means "fortified enclosure". This, combined with Newbury's proximity to the High Hay, perhaps suggests that Newbury was built as a more recent guard against intruders from the Old Forest.

## Inspiration
There is a town named Newbury in Berkshire, England.

## Portrayal in adaptations
'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Newbury is a small hamlet just past the Buckland Gate. At which Newbury ends and Bucklebury begins can be hard to determine.
