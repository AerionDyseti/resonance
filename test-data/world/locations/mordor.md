# Mordor

**Mordor** was a black, volcanic plain in the southeast of Middle-earth, east of Gondor, Ithilien, and the great river Anduin. In the Second Age, Mordor was chosen by Sauron as his realm due to its three sides guarded by mountain ranges, creating a natural fortress, preventing any from easily invading it. 

## Geography

The large mountain ranges protecting Mordor were arranged roughly in a rectangular manner: the Ered Lithui ('Ash Mountains') to the north, and the Ephel Dúath ('Mountains of Shadow') to the west and south. In the northwest corner of Mordor, the deep valley of Udûn was one of the few entrances for large armies. Guarding the outer entrance was the Black Gate. Outside it was the Dagorlad or "Battle Plain". Sauron's main fortress of Barad-dûr sat at the end of a spur of the Ered Lithui. To the southwest of Barad-dûr lay the arid Plateau of Gorgoroth and Mount Doom; to its east lay the plain of Lithlad.

Mordor's geography was excellent for defence against enemies attacking on all fronts, as nearly unscalable mountains defended Mordor on three sides, while the broken, jagged land of Gorgoroth and Núrn would greatly impede any army that managed to break through. Aside from its distant, eastern border, Mordor's only exit less fortified than the Black Gate was through the Morgul Pass and Cirith Ungol. Isildur originally built the city of Minas Ithil to guard the western end of both passes from any threat from Mordor, but in the Third Age, the population of the city waned, and it was conquered by the Nazgûl. It became the home of the Ringwraiths and was renamed Minas Morgul, thereafter a great stronghold of evil, ever at war with Gondor to the west until the end of the War of the Ring. To escape the vigilance of Morgul, to enter Mordor one still had to get past the lair of Shelob and the Tower of Cirith Ungol — a feat only Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee (led by Gollum) ever accomplished — though not without being waylaid by Shelob, and Frodo being taken prisoner to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.  

The southern part of Mordor, called Núrn, was slightly more fertile, watered enough to hold the inland Sea of Núrnen. Núrn was made somewhat fertile because the ash blown from Mount Doom left its soil nutrient-rich, thus allowing dry-land farming.  

To the west of Mordor was the narrow land of Ithilien, with the city of Osgiliath and the great river Anduin, while directly east of it was Rhûn, and to the south-east, Khand.  

The east of Mordor is by far the least mentioned of any of Mordor's geographic notes and descriptions. One might assume that the easiest route to Mount Doom would be for the Fellowship to journey through the 'unguarded' section in the east, which no mountains obstructed. However, it would have been difficult to pass unnoticed, because the many roads running from Mordor into Rhûn were often marched along by Easterlings entering Mordor or patrolling the roads and borders.

## History

### Early history
Mount Doom was formed by Morgoth during the First Age. At an unknown time in the First Age, perhaps shortly before the War of Wrath, Shelob left the Nan Dungortheb and settled in Mordor with her offspring. Sauron settled in there 1,000 years after the end of the First Age, and it remained the center of his power throughout the Second Age and again at the end of the Third Age of Middle-earth. In the northwestern corner of this land stood Mount Doom, where Sauron forged the One Ring. Near Mount Doom stood Sauron's stronghold Barad-dûr. After this time, Sauron was known as the Dark Lord of Mordor.  

For two and a half thousand years, Sauron ruled Mordor uninterruptedly. Having wrought the Ring, it was from there that he launched the attack upon the Elves of Eregion in the War of the Elves and Sauron. He was repelled by the Men of Númenor. He later opposed Númenor, but such was their power that his own servants deserted him, and he was captured by the Númenóreans and brought to their island kingdom, eventually causing its destruction (see the Downfall of Númenor). Immediately after Númenor's destruction, Sauron returned to Mordor as a spirit and resumed his rule.  

### The Last Alliance and Third Age

Sauron's rule was interrupted again when his efforts to destroy Gondor failed; his forces were driven back, and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men formed to oppose him. After the Battle of Dagorlad, the army of the Last Alliance entered Mordor and besieged Barad-dûr for seven years. Eventually, Sauron came forth and was defeated in a final battle on the slopes of Mount Doom. For about 1,600 years, Mordor was guarded by Gondor to prevent evil from returning. The Towers of the Teeth, Durthang, and the Tower of Cirith Ungol were built by Gondor to watch the major entry points to the dark land. Gorgoroth during this time was desolate, with Barad-dûr levelled down to its foundations.  

However, following the Great Plague in TA 1636, the watch on Mordor failed, and evil began to creep back in. Sauron eventually used the Wainriders to distract and weaken Gondor, and the Nazgûl re-entered in TA 1980. They reclaimed Mordor and started to rebuild its might. Minas Ithil was conquered by the Nine Ringwraiths in TA 2002, and Gondor's abandoned fortresses were occupied by evil creatures. By the time Sauron returned to Mordor in TA 2942, after his false defeat at Dol Guldur (in the events that took place at the time of Bilbo Baggins' quest), Mordor was too strong to be captured by any military force available in Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age. Sauron declared himself openly in TA 2951, and Mount Doom burst into flame three years later.  

### War of the Ring
In the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered all his forces in Mordor. To the north were great garrisons and forges of war, while surrounding the bitter inland Sea of Núrnen to the south lay the vast fields of Núrn, tended for the provision of the armies by hordes of slaves brought in from lands to the east and south. After the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the Army of the West marched to the Black Gate. Sauron sent his army to destroy the Men of Gondor and Rohan at the Battle of the Black Gate, but then Frodo Baggins destroyed the One Ring and Mordor fell. Sauron's power was destroyed, sending shock waves through the air and ground. The Dark Tower of Barad-dûr, the Black Gate and the Towers of Teeth collapsed into ruin. Mount Doom erupted, and both Sauron and his Ringwraiths were destroyed. The shadows dissipated, and Aragorn II gave the land to Sauron's slaves. It is untold what became of the remaining Orc-holds.  

## Formation

In , Karen Wynn Fonstad assumes that the lands of Mordor and Khand lay where the inland Sea of Helcar had been, and that the Sea of Rhûn and Sea of Núrnen were its remnants. In particular, she suggested that the uplift of the Plateau of Gorgoroth was closely related to the formation of Mount Doom and that the Ephel Dúath formed as a result of a tectonic uplift caused by the cataclysms of the War of Wrath. However, , the 12th volume of , which was published after the *Atlas*, states that at least Mount Doom was created by Morgoth during the First Age, so before the draining of the Sea of Helcar. Also, the name Mordor was given already before Sauron settled there.  

## Languages and people
At the time of the War of the Ring, Sauron had gathered great armies to serve him. These included enslaved Men of the East and the South, who spoke a variety of tongues, and Orcs and Trolls, who usually spoke a debased form of the Common Speech. However, within Barad-dûr and among the captains of Mordor (the Ringwraiths and other high-ranking servants such as the Mouth of Sauron), the Black Speech was still used, the language devised by Sauron during the Dark Years of the Second Age. In addition to ordinary Orcs and Trolls, Sauron had bred a stronger strain of Orcs, the Black Uruks, and very large Trolls known as Olog-hai, who could endure the sun. The Olog-hai knew only the Black Speech.  

## Etymology
- Mordor* has two meanings: *The Black Land* or *The Dark Land* in Tolkien's contrived language Sindarin, and *The Land of Shadow* in Quenya. The root *mor* ("dark", "black") also appears in Moria. *Dor* ("land") also appears in *Gondor* ("stone-land") and *Doriath* ("fenced land"). The Quenya word for shadow is "mordo". It is pronounced with a Russian-sounding *r*. The gate of Mordor, Morannon, means Black Gate. It was named this by the Elves in the Second Age.  

A proposed etymology outside the context of Middle-earth is Old English *morthor*, which means "mortal sin" or "murder" (the latter descended from the former). It is not uncommon for names in Tolkien's fiction to have relevant meanings in several languages, both those invented by Tolkien and "real" ones, but this, of course, happens with any two languages. *Mordor* is also a name cited in some Nordic mythologies referring to a land where its citizens practise evil without knowing it, imposed on themselves by the society long created for that purpose. This quite fits with Tolkien's Mordor.  

## In adaptations
### *Middle-earth:* *Shadow of Mordor*
In Monolith's , set sometime between The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring, the player character Talion is a member of the Gondorian Rangers who garrison the Black Gate. The position is treated as close to exile, as Talion had been stationed there for killing a nobleman in defence of his wife. The Rangers, however, are only a token force who watch over the vassal Outcasts, the descendants of Gondorian criminals and freed slaves who populate Udûn. This leads to them being easily and swiftly defeated by a force of Orcs led by Sauron's Black Hand. Talion and his family are ritually sacrificed in an attempt to bring back the wraith of Celebrimbor, the Elf who forged the Rings of Power. Though seemingly a failure for the Black Hand, Celebrimbor and Talion are bound together in undeath and wage a guerrilla war against the Orcish armies, joining other resistance factions. 

These include Gollum, currently searching for the One Ring in the region of its creation, and the free Outcasts who have escaped enslavement by the Orcs, led by a Ranger deserter, Hirgon. Talion also travels to Nurn at Thaurband, working with the Queen of Nurn who was under the spell of Saruman but is eventually freed. Talion faces the Tower of Sauron at Ered Glamhoth on the other side of the Sea of Núrnen.

Orcish culture is also extensively explored in this game, revealing a web of hierarchy, infighting, and betrayal, as well as the Orcs' love for Grog. Mordor's wildlife is also showcased, featuring the feline counterparts of Wargs, the Caragor; the gigantic Graugs; and the underground-dwelling Ghul.

A DLC campaign also showcases Celebrimbor's first war against Sauron. After Sauron's deception as the Giftbringer is revealed, Celebrimbor takes his Elven armies of Eregion against Sauron. Despite a near defeat, the One Ring slips from Sauron's hand onto Celebrimbor's, allowing him to turn the tide entirely against Sauron. The campaign follows Celebrimbor as he uses the One Ring to dominate Orcs into his army to oppose Sauron. However, at the cusp of Celebrimbor's victory, the One Ring once again changes sides, falling back into Sauron's hands. This allows him to defeat Celebrimbor, who is then tortured and killed alongside his family, whom Celebrimbor had assumed long dead.

### *Middle-earth: Shadow of War*
In Monolith's , following the events of the previous game, Talion and Celebrimbor decide to forge a New Ring of Power to defeat Sauron's armies, with the ultimate fate of the Udûn Outcasts and the Núrnen tribesmen left unknown. However, soon after the New Ring's completion, it falls into the clutches of Shelob (here portrayed as a shapeshifter with prophetic powers).

Talion is soon redirected to Minas Ithil, currently under siege by Sauron's armies and led by the Ringwraiths, where he encounters the cut-off armies of Gondor defending it. Celebrimbor is chiefly concerned with recovering the New Ring and keeping the Palantír in Minas Ithil out of Sauron's hands. Ultimately, the siege of Minas Ithil ends when the leader of the Gondorian garrison, Castamir, hands the city over to the Witch-King in exchange for his daughter's life—a bargain the Ringwraiths renege on—but his daughter Idril and the soldier Baranor manage to escape to lead a Gondorian resistance in Mordor. With Minas Ithil's fall, it is transformed into Minas Morgul.

Here, Shelob relinquishes the New Ring to Talion and Celebrimbor, and they begin to liberate Mordor, christening themselves the Bright Lord and dominating Orcs to form their new army. The scope of Mordor is expanded to include a new section of Núrnen, the caves of Cirith Ungol, Minas Ithil/Morgul, the lava-filled crags of Gorgoroth, the ice-covered mountains in Seregost, and a DLC location, the arid desert of Lithlad.

Several missions are available in Mordor, including hunting down scattered Gondorian artefacts once held in Minas Ithil; finding memories of Shelob that detail an ancient alliance between her and Sauron; aiding the Forest Spirit of Carnan in defeating an armoured Balrog summoned by Sauron's army; and revisiting the previous game, seeing glimpses of Celebrimbor's prior conquest of Mordor with the One Ring, as well as unlocking his ancient set of weapons. Gollum appears once again, portrayed as serving Shelob, and a new faction is introduced—the Blades of Galadriel—who repeatedly hunt down the Ringwraiths even as they return in undeath. The central missions concern assaulting the major forts held by Sauron's armies by various means, and, once the Bright Lord has cemented his control of Mordor, assaulting and overthrowing Sauron.

However, the final assault on Barad-dûr is waylaid when Talion defeats a Ringwraith who is revealed to be Isildur. Celebrimbor urges Talion to dominate the former Gondorian king to add him to their ranks, but Talion, as a Gondorian, refuses. This proves to be the breaking point in their alliance; Celebrimbor takes the New Ring and gifts it to Eltariel, the Blade of Galadriel, who sides with Celebrimbor with the promise of finally ending Sauron's rule. This leaves Talion without his earthly tether, and he soon begins to die; however, he takes Isildur's Ring of Power to preserve himself, while at the same time opening himself up to Sauron's influence.

Celebrimbor and Eltariel continue the assault on Barad-dûr, confronting Sauron, but Sauron manages to cut the New Ring from Eltariel's hand. The spirits of Sauron and Celebrimbor are then locked into a decades-long struggle atop Barad-dûr.

Talion, meanwhile, now exiled from the Bright Lord's army, establishes his own base in Minas Ithil and sets out to reconquer Mordor from Celebrimbor's army, while at the same time attempting to resist his Ring of Power's corruption. While he eventually succeeds in conquering Mordor, by the end he is finally corrupted as a Ringwraith. These decades-long 'Shadow Wars' stall Sauron's conquests and ambitions, allowing the Free Peoples of Middle-earth to rally against Mordor, with Talion finally being banished from undeath when the One Ring is destroyed in Mount Doom.

The culture of Orcs is once again expanded upon, including the addition of the half-troll Olog-hai. The Orcs are split into several tribes. The Mystic tribe uses black magic and necromancy; the Dark tribe focuses on stealth and ambush; the Feral tribe has mastered hunting and the domestication of Mordor's fiercest animals; the Marauder tribe lives for plunder and loot; the Machine tribe have mastered Mordor's burgeoning industry; the Warmonger tribe reveres warfare itself; the Terror tribe is obsessed with both causing and receiving pain; and, with the DLC, there are also the Slaughter tribe, who butcher their enemies and consume the meat, and the Outlaw tribe, which pursues a policy of Mordor for the Orcs, shunning both the Dark and Bright Lords.

DLC campaigns also follow the characters of Eltariel and Baranor following the conclusion of the main campaign. 

### *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*
In Amazon Studios' series , Mordor and some of the areas around it in southern Rhovanion are referred to as the **Southlands** before the forging of the Rings of Power and the One Ring. The geographic bounds of the Southlands are not yet specified, but are implied to encompass at least part of Mordor. The characters Adar, Arondir, Bronwyn, Theo, Rowan, Tredwill, Waldreg, and Halbrand are among the land's inhabitants.

#### Season One
The villages of Tirharad and Hordern, and the supposed original home of Halbrand, are in the Southlands. The Elf Arondir and his company are first seen stationed in Tirharad.

In , "", Galadriel discovers at Númenor's Hall of Lore that the sigil of Sauron she had seen in various places was, apparently, a small, abstract map of the Southlands, suggesting to her that Sauron had chosen that land to re-establish his presence in some capacity. The Trenches, the Orc-hold to which Arondir, Revion, and Médhor are taken, is also in the Southlands, likely west of the Ephel Duath. Magrot, an Orc taskmaster, and Adar himself reside there.

At the end of  (""), Waldreg uses the Orc Sigil Hilt as a key to open a dam. The water flows through tunnels dug by the Orcs shown in prior episodes towards an inactive volcano. When the water hits the underground lava pit, it causes the volcano to erupt, turning the Southlands into an ashen wasteland. It is revealed that the volcano is Mount Doom and the desolated Southlands are now renamed Mordor.

#### Season Two

In , "", Adar is shown in a flashback "killing" Sauron, which begins his rise to leadership of the Orcs. He continues to consolidate his power in Mordor and meets Halbrand, whom he tortures into swearing allegiance to the "Lord of Mordor". In  (""), he appears to have led his Orc legions out of Mordor towards Eregion, where he has heard Sauron has appeared.
