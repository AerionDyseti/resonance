# East Bight

The **East Bight** was a large clearing in southeast Mirkwood.

East Bight was the great indentation in the eastern edge of Mirkwood, a treeless region that was roughly square in shape, some fifty miles to a side, towards the southern end of the wood. The "Bight" was not a natural formation, but rather the result of generations of forestry by the Northmen who had historically occupied the borders of the forest. Because of the Bight, that part of Mirkwood immediately to the north of Amon Lanc was less than one hundred miles across, and so it became known as the Narrows of the Forest. It became territory of Sauron after King Oropher's defeat in the War of the Last Alliance.
