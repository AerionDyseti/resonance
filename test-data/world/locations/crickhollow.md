# Crickhollow

**Crickhollow** was a location, perhaps a small settlement, in Buckland, located a short way to the north-east of Brandy Hall.

Its most notable spot was an isolated house standing back from the lane in the middle of a wide lawn. It was surrounded by low trees inside an outer hedge, and there were no other dwellings nearby. This house was occasionally occupied with Brandybuck Hobbits who grew tired of the often crowded Brandy Hall.

## History
Frodo Baggins was instructed by Gandalf to find a reason why he should leave Hobbiton (and the Shire) and meet him in Bree. In the summer of , Frodo Baggins bought this house as an excuse for leaving Hobbiton to the east.

While Frodo, Sam, and Pippin moved out, Merry and Fatty Bolger were already in the house at Crickhollow, making preparations for their arrival. They were the only Hobbits who knew that Frodo would begin a journey to the east, so they made preparations for their departure as well.

On 25 September, Frodo and his company arrived at the lodgings and met Merry and Fatty. The next day Frodo and his party departed for the Old Forest. It was decided that to hide Frodo's departure, Fatty would stay at Crickhollow to maintain the pretence that Frodo was still in residence. but Fatty Bolger had already escaped. He had run to the nearest house, and from there he spread the news of an invasion, which travelled swiftly to Brandy Hall and resulted in the rousing of the hobbits of Buckland.

After the War of the Ring, Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow.

## Etymology
Tolkien noted that the first element is obsolete and of obscure meaning. A *hollow* is a small depression in the ground.

Based on this, David Salo has suggested a speculative Old Hobbitish form **Crycholh* from which Crickhollow derives. The obscure element *cryc* could represent, as can be expected in Stoorish, a Celtic (Old Brythonic) word for "hill". The placename would therefore mean "low place by the hill".

It is not clear in *The Lord of the Rings* whether Crickhollow was a village or a region occupied by a solitary house. The Encyclopedia of Arda mentions Crickhollow as a village. Robert Foster describes Crickhollow as a "place in Buckland" whereas Karen Fonstad believes that Crickhollow is just the name of Frodo's house.
