# Thargelion

**Thargelion** was a land in East Beleriand during the First Age.

## Description

Thargelion was located east of the river Gelion. It was north of the river Ascar; therefore, it was not counted as part of Ossiriand.

## History

After the rebellion of the Ñoldor, this land was committed to the rule of Caranthir, fourth Son of Fëanor. It was often called **Dor Caranthir** and **Talath Rhûnen** after him. The Dwarf-road passed through the southern tip of this land;  all who traveled through it paid toll to Caranthir, which made him very wealthy.

Once, the Laiquendi of Ossiriand dwelt in Thargelion. Thargelion was ravaged by the Orcs of Morgoth during the Dagor Bragollach, forcing Caranthir and his people to flee.

Most of Thargelion was destroyed after the War of Wrath, but some of it survived, becoming part of Forlindon.

## Etymology

In Sindarin, ***Thargelion*** literally means "Across the River Gelion", from *thar* ("athwart, across").

Its other names, *Dor Caranthir* means "Land of Caranthir", and *Talath Rhúnen* means "the East Vale", from the Sindarin *talath* ("field, plains")

## Other versions of the legendarium

In earlier writings, Thargelion's name was *Radhrost*, the East Vale, by the Doriathrin tongue of the Dark Elves. The name was later replaced by Talath Rhúnen.
