# Lammoth

**Lammoth** was a region in Beleriand, in the northwest of Middle-earth, north of the Firth of Drengist and between Ered Lómin and the shore of Belegaer. It was the location of the Thieves' Quarrel between Morgoth and Ungoliant, and the Battle of the Lammoth between Fingolfin and Morgoth's Orcs.

## History
Lammoth was the land of "the Great Echo", and it was so named because it was where Morgoth and Ungoliant fled after the darkening of Valinor and Morgoth's theft of the Silmarils. Ungoliant, who greatly thirsted for the Silmarils demanded them from Morgoth, and when he refused to give them to her, she attacked Morgoth in order to get them. Weakened by the power that had gone out of him, he let out a great cry which echoed throughout the north of Middle-earth, and there and ever after the echo of his great cry lingered until the end of Beleriand.

- "Ungoliant had grown great, and [Morgoth] less by the power that had gone out of him; and she rose against him...Then Morgoth sent forth a terrible cry, that echoed in the mountains. Therefore, that region was called Lammoth, for the echoes of his voice dwelt there ever after, so that any who cried aloud in that land awoke them, all the waste between the hills and the sea was filled with a clamor as of voices in anguish. The cry of Morgoth in that hour was the greatest and most dreadful that was ever heard in the northern world."*

The echo of so many voices in Lammoth traveled north, alerting Morgoth to the arrival of the host of Fëanor in Middle-earth, and he sent a great host against Fëanor in Mithrim starting the Dagor-nuin-Giliath.

After the first moonrise, when the host of Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth after crossing the Grinding Ice, the Ñoldor were ambushed by Orcs. Although the Elves remained victorious, Argon, the third son of Fingolfin, was slain during the confrontation.

## Other versions
In *Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin* chapter of , the name instead refers to the acoustic properties of the location and the natural reverberations they cause. When Fëanor landed there in the First Age, *"the voices of his host were swelled to a mighty clamour"* by the Echoing Mountains.

## Etymology
***Lammoth*** is Sindarin for 'tongue-host'.
