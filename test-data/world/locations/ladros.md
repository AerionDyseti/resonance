# Ladros

**Ladros** was the name of the north-eastern corner of Dorthonion, in northern Beleriand during the First Age.

As the rest of Dorthonion, Ladros was a region dotted with great pine forests, steep slopes and hilly surroundings. It lay at the very border of Morgoth's realm, just south of the Anfauglith. It was briefly held as a fief by the House of Bëor.

## History
Before the coming of Men into the west, the Ñoldor lords Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin, ruled all Dorthonion. As the fief of Dor-lómin within Hithlum was given to the House of Hador, so was Ladros given to the House of Bëor for their loyalty in service to the House of Finrod. Boromir, son of Boron and grandson of Bëor, became the first Lord of Ladros. He was succeeded by his son Bregor, and he by his son Bregolas. Bregolas fell in the Dagor Bragollach, and his brother Barahir would have been Lord of Ladros. He never regained his lands, though, as Morgoth's forces swept through them after the battle.

The last remnant of Bëor's folk dwelt in the highlands of Dorthonion after Morgoth conquered them, led by Barahir. Eventually they were worsted and only one, Beren son of Barahir (who would in turn have been Lord of Ladros), escaped to continue resisting Morgoth.

Along with the rest of Beleriand, it sunk at the end of the War of Wrath.

## Etymology
The meaning of ***Ladros*** is not explicitly stated, however it might be the Sindarin word for *Land of Drizzle*.
