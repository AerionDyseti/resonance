# Osgiliath

**Osgiliath** was the old capital city of Gondor. The city stood on both sides of the river Anduin

In the Great Hall of Osgiliath the thrones of the sons of Elendil were set side by side. In its days of glory, the city featured quays to handle sea-going vessels that came up from the sea, a great stone bridge supporting houses and towers of stone, and the Dome of Stars, which housed the Master Stone of Osgiliath, the greatest of the seven *Palantíri*.

## History
Founded by Isildur and Anárion When the army of the Last Alliance arrived and later defeated Sauron the threat to the city was lifted.

Over the next few hundred years, Gondor endured many military defeats east of the Anduin, especially the taking of Minas Ithil in . Osgiliath became vulnerable to attack and was widely believed to be haunted, as its population continued to shrink. Osgiliath was finally abandoned by the remaining civilian population after being overrun by Uruk-hai in , although the orcs were defeated by Steward Boromir.

In the following March, well into the War, Sauron launched a full-scale invasion of Gondor west of the Anduin, and despite the Rangers' defence of the western part of the city, Osgiliath quickly fell to Sauron's forces, or "Fortress of the Stars", being a combination of *ost* ("citadel", "fortress") + *giliath* ("hosts of stars").

:In a scene in the Extended Edition, Faramir has a flashback. Boromir reclaims the city for Gondor, and the soldiers feast. The scene is meant to highlight the relation between Boromir, Faramir and Denethor.

**2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*:*'
:Gothmog and his orcs finally breach the defences of the Gondorian troopers, and beat them back with heavy losses. Madril is slain, as are several others. On their retreat to Minas Tirith, they are beset by the Nazgûl, only to be saved by Gandalf.

:Not impressed by Faramir's deeds, and more upset about the loss of Osgiliath, Denethor sends his son back to Osgiliath, but his company is slaughtered, and Faramir badly wounded. This scene replaced the defence of the Causeway Forts in the book.

:Osgiliath exists in three different versions in the game. Before the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Osgiliath is overrun by the Morgul-host, while Mablung and Damrod lead the surviving Rangers of Ithilien in the city into hiding in the culverts. After the Battle the situation is reversed: the city has been reclaimed as the Host of the West makes its way to the Black Gate, but remaining enemies still hold out in the culverts below. A third version of the city, set in T.A. 3018 during the Sauron's attack on Osgiliath is the battleground for player-versus-monster-player fights; this version is notable for having all bridges across the Anduin still intact.

:The notable landmarks are the Gates of the Moon at the eastern entrance to the city are beyond which is the Court of Isildur, the Gates of the Sun at the western entrance beyond which is the Court of Anárion, The Palace of Eldacar in the north-west corner of the city, Meneldil's Square, Rómendacil's Square, the Theatre of Cemendur and the Dome of Stars.
