# Dor-lómin

**Dor-lómin** was a region of Hithlum in the First Age.

## Description

Dor-lómin was a country in the south-western part of Hithlum, bordered in the east by the Mountains of Mithrim, and in the north by the river which formed the Rainbow Cleft, known as Annon-in-Gelydh, or the "Gate of the Noldor". It was the birthplace of Túrin, son of Húrin and Morwen. There was also a mountain pass in its south, unknown to the Enemy.

Húrin's house was built in its south-western corner near the mountain known as Amon Darthir, where the river Nen Lalaith began. but in FA 416 Fingolfin gave it to Hador. Dor-lómin became a fief of the Third House of the Edain, which flourished there, strengthened by refugees of the First House from Dorthonion, until the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Morgoth then gave Dor-lómin, together with the rest of Hithlum, to his Easterlings, who absorbed or enslaved the surviving Edain. Tuor son of Huor was fostered by the Elves of Androth in the Mountains of Mithrim.

Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, the army of Dor-lómin was between 12,000 and 15,000. The entire host was destroyed during the battle.

After Túrin fled south over the Ered Wethrin, bands of Easterlings came and attacked and enslaved the peoples of Dor-lómin, save Morwen, her daughter Niënor, and her servants, including Sador Labadal. The outlaws were led by Brodda, who wedded Aerin so that when he was dead, he would have an heir to keep the land under his family's rule. Over a year after Túrin came to Doriath, Morwen and Niënor went seeking Túrin in Menegroth. Later, Túrin came to seek Morwen in Dor-lómin, but they had already gone south over the mountains. Like the rest of Hithlum it was destroyed during the War of Wrath.
