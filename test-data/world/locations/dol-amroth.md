# Dol Amroth

**Dol Amroth** was a promontory, ruled as a hereditary princedom from its stronghold, situated on a peninsula in Gondor facing the Bay of Belfalas.

The emblem of the Prince of Dol Amroth was a silver-upon-blue banner, bearing a ship with a swan-prow upon the sea.

## Description
Its northern shore defined part of Cobas Haven, the small bay into which the Morthond River flowed. Upon the headland the Princes of Dol Amroth established a castle and thus Dol Amroth referred to this stronghold and to the neighbouring port-city, the chief city of the fief of Belfalas. Within the walls of the city was the Sea-ward Tower or Tirith Aear, which had a bell that was rung for the benefit of mariners.

## History
The first known settlers of Belfalas were Sindar refugees from Beleriand in the late First Age, and in the Second Age (after the War of the Elves and Sauron) the headland that would become Dol Amroth was settled by Galadriel and Celeborn; their company was increased by Elves from Lórinand. and its first ruler became Galador.

In all, there were twenty-one Princes of Dol Amroth before the twenty-second, Imrahil, led a company of knights and a contingent of 700 men from the city to Minas Tirith during the War of the Ring. Because of this, the ruling house and their kin were noble by blood and fair in face and mind.

In addition to the rulers of Dol Amroth, the people of Dol Amroth were also of high blood being tall, grey-eyed, proud, and dark-haired, indicative of their high Númenórean blood. Being mostly Dúnedain of the South, the inhabitants of Dol Amroth were also some of the few people of Gondor who knew and spoke Sindarin on a daily basis. They were famous as the most skilful harp players in all of Gondor, who played at the coronation of Aragorn. 

## Etymology
- Dol Amroth* is Sindarin from *dol* ("hill") and the name of the King *Amroth* ("Upclimber"), hence "Hill of Amroth".
