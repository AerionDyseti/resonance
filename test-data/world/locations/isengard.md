# Isengard

**Isengard**, also known as **Angrenost** ('Iron Fortress') in Sindarin, was one of the three major fortresses of Gondor, and held within it one of the realm's palantíri.

However, in the latter half of the Third Age, the stronghold came into the possession of the Wizard Saruman, becoming his home and seat of power until his defeat in the War of the Ring. 

## Description

Isengard was built in the Second Age around the tower of Orthanc by the Númenóreans in exile, in the days of their power, in Nan Curunír (The Wizard's Vale) in the Misty Mountains. Its location was at the northwestern corner of the Kingdom of Gondor, guarding the Fords of Isen from enemy incursions into Calenardhon and, together with the fortress of Aglarond to its south, protecting the Gap of Calenardhon.

Isengard was comprised of a black, circular, stone-wall surrounding a broad plain, in the center of which was the Tower of Orthanc. Isengard had only one gate, which faced south.

The River Angren (or Isen) began at Methedras behind Isengard, which also formed its northern wall. The other three sides were guarded by a large wall, known as the Ring of Isengard, which was only breached by the inflow of the River Angren at the northeast through a portcullis, and the gate of Isengard at the south, at both shores of the river. The Gate was said to be able to open without a sound.

Isengard was, at first, a green and beautiful tower complex, with many large trees and grass fields, fed by the river until it was dammed by Saruman. During his tenure as an opportunistic servant of Sauron, Saruman turned Isengard into "a child's model or a slave's flattery" of Mordor. Its gardens destroyed, the valley was covered in pits filled with forges and machinery needed for war. After the Wizard's defeat, however, Treebeard and the rest of the Ents made it a vivid green area again, after destroying the walls and dam, renaming it the **Treegarth of Orthanc**.

## History
In the centuries following the Great Plague the land of Calenardhon became depopulated, and the last Warden of Orthanc was recalled to Minas Tirith. Isengard remained garrisoned by a small company, led by a hereditary captain, much as happened at Aglarond at the time. At first messengers were still sent to the fortress by the Stewards, although these dwindled and then eventually ceased entirely.

In TA 2510, after Calenardhon was given to the Éothéod by Cirion, Steward of Gondor, and became Rohan, Isengard remained part of Gondor, and the company of Aglarond removed to the northern fortress, although the rest of Gondor had virtually forgotten it. The small guard intermarried much with the Dunlendings, until the place became a Dunlending fortress in all but name. Orthanc, however, remained closed, as the Steward of Gondor held the keys. Isengard soon became all but deserted.

During the rule of Rohan's King Déor, in TA 2710, the line of hereditary captains commanding the fortress garrison died out and Isengard became openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Using Isengard as their base, the Dunlendings continued to raid Rohan during the reign of Déor's son Gram, until during the rule of Gram's son Helm Hammerhand a Dunlending lord, Freca and his son Wulf nearly managed to destroy the Rohirrim. The Rohirrim led by Helm's nephew, Fréaláf Hildeson, eventually won, taking Isengard by starving out the Dunlendings in TA 2759 and guarding it for Gondor.

At this time, the Wizard Saruman the White suddenly reappeared from the East, and offered to guard Isengard. The Steward of Gondor, Beren, gladly gave him the keys to Orthanc, and Saruman settled there. After him the valley became known as *Nan Curunír*, "Wizard's Vale". At first, the White Wizard was merely Warden of the Tower on behalf of Gondor, but as his ambitions grew and fall began, he took the fortress for his own in TA 2953. Saruman fortified Isengard and secretly troubled Rohan by aiding its enemies during Thengel's reign. Having become Sauron's servant by TA 3000, Saruman began building an army to "deliver" the Rohirrim to his "dark master", though his true goal was to try claim the One Ring for himself. At Isengard, Saruman would create the Uruk-hai, using the dark crafts he had studied to create a "perfected" subspecies of Orc. These Uruk-hai bred at Isengard soon began making sorties with Orcs from the Misty Mountains and Mordor into Rohirrim territory. Saruman also tasked his agents in the Shire with procuring pipe-weed and other provisions and shipping them to Isengard in preparation for war. 

In TA 3018, Gandalf came to Isengard to take counsel with Saruman. It was then that the Grey Pilgrim discovered his intentions and defection to the Dark Lord's side. With Gandalf refusing to either submit to Sauron or reveal the Ring's whereabouts, Saruman imprisoned him on the pinnacle of Orthanc. From there, the Grey Pilgrim saw Isengard's host amass. In the War of the Ring, the Isengarders now defiled Nan Curunír, cutting down its tree gardens and damming and diverting the Isen river. The valley was filled with deep caverns, housing forgeries and breeding pits for Orcs.  After Gandalf's escape from Orthanc, Saruman sent both Uglúk's warband to hunt for the Fellowship of the Ring and raiding parties to ravage Rohan's Westfold. Failing to attain the Ring, Saruman turned to seeking Sauron's clemency by marshalling his entire army of Uruk-hai and Half-orcs, as well as the Dunlendings at Isengard for a final attack against Théoden's Rohirrim at Helm's Deep (in the game Lord of the Rings: Rise to War, though this is not part of Tolkien lore, it is stated that an Uruk berserker, Ugthak, who was personally created by Saruman, led the assault on Helm's Deep and broke its walls).  While the Battle of the Hornburg unfurled, a host of Ents led by Treebeard of Fangorn attacked Isengard, wrecking the fortress, though Orthanc remained intact. Saruman’s entire army of Orcs were slain by the Rohirrim and by a host of Huorns who had joined the battle. 

The Hobbits Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, as the new "doorwardens", received Théoden, Aragorn, and Gandalf at the gates. Saruman was confronted but refused to beg for pardon, and he was kept under Treebeard's guard together with his footman, Gríma Wormtongue. It was planned by Sauron that Isengard would be given to his ambassador, the Mouth of Sauron, a far more trustworthy servant than Saruman. The Wizard nonetheless abandoned the stronghold after the downfall of his "dark master", playing off Treebeard's hatred of caging any living thing in order to manipulate him into letting him leave. 

### After the War of the Ring
Early in the Fourth Age, Isengard was restored and Treebeard replanted many trees. Orthanc again became a tower of the Reunited Kingdom of King Aragorn II Elessar.

Under the Ent dominion, the ring-wall was torn down and the Ents planted the **Watchwood** there, naming the new forest the "Treegarth of Orthanc". Saruman's pits and caverns were filled, and the land was healed. The Valley was now filled with trees, and a small lake was constructed near Orthanc. Nan Curunír was given to the Ents by Aragorn, to do with as they wished, granted that they keep watch upon Orthanc and prevent anyone without permission from entering.
