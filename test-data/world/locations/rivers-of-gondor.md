# Rivers of Gondor

Gondor had many rivers, most of which were sourced from the White Mountains and flowed either into the Bay of Belfalas or into the Anduin.

There are two common lists of the **rivers of Gondor**. The rivers Anduin, Sernui, and Gilrain appear in both.

The *Seven Rivers of Gondor* were:
#The river Lefnui
#The river Morthond (Blackroot)
#The river Ciril
#The river Ringló
#The river Gilrain, which started as two unnamed tributaries in the White Mountains, and flowed south
#The river Sernui, (also spelled *Serni*), which began in the plains of Lebennin and met the Bay of Belfalas north of Ethir Anduin at the city of Linhir
#The river Anduin, nearly three-hundred miles of which flowed through Gondor's territory

The *Five Rivers of Lebennin* were:
#The river Anduin
#The river Celos, which started in the White Mountains and became a tributary of the Sirith
#The river Sirith, which met Anduin at Pelargir
#The river Sernui
#The river Gilrain

The river Poros was the effective southern border of Gondor during the later Third Age until the loss of Ithilien in TA 2901. After this the Anduin marked Gondor's eastern and southern border.
