# Brandywine River

The **Brandywine River**, also known as the **Baranduin**, was a river of Middle-earth located in both the Shire and northern Eriador.

## Description

The Brandywine River flowed out of Lake Evendim in northern Eriador, and continued eastward for about 60 miles before turning generally southward; and afterwards for about another 120 miles flowed through the easternmost reaches of the Shire, forming the Shire's eastern border and separating Buckland, from the Eastfarthing and the rest of the Shire. Its only major crossings in the Shire were the Brandywine Bridge (originally *Bridge of Stonebows*) on the East-West Road and the Bucklebury Ferry.

Skirting the Old Forest to the south, the river then looped south-westward, crossing an old road at Sarn Ford and flowed to the north of the depopulated region of Minhiriath before flowing into the Great Sea to the north of the forested region of Eryn Vorn. The river also has an island known as Girdley Island in the river just above the Brandywine Bridge.

No tributaries of the Brandywine River are described except those near or in the Shire:

-  The Water - in the central Shire, from the northwest
-  The Stockbrook - arose in the Woody End
-  The river Shirebourn - rises in Green-Hill Country; the Thistle Brook flowed into it
-  Withywindle - from the Old Forest

## History

Frodo Baggins' father, Drogo Baggins, was said to have drowned in the Brandywine River with his wife during a boating trip.

The Brandywine was much longer before the War of Wrath destroyed not only most of Beleriand but part of the Great Gulf's northern shores.

To the hobbits of the Shire, the Brandywine was the boundary between the known and unknown, and even those who lived in Buckland on the immediate opposite shore were considered "peculiar".

## Etymology

The name ***Baranduin** *was Sindarin for "golden-brown river". The hobbits of the Shire called it in their language **Branda-nîn**, meaning "border water", which functioned as a sort of pun. Later, the pun *Bralda-hîm*, meaning "heady ale", was coined. *Brandywine* is simply the English rendering of the same word, as described by Tolkien.
