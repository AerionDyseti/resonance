# Ossiriand

**Ossiriand** (Sindarin IPA: ) was a region of East Beleriand. It was also known as the **Land of Seven Rivers**.

## Description

Ossiriand was the most eastern region of Beleriand during the First Age, lying between the Blue Mountains and the river Gelion. Along the northern shore of the Ascar ran the Dwarf-road to Nogrod. The region was apparently warm and gentle, with coniferous woodlands.

Seven rivers lay in the region of Ossiriand, and these are (from north to south):
#River Gelion
#River Ascar or *Rathlóriel*
#River Thalos
#River Legolin
#River Brilthor
#River Duilwen
#River Adurant

## History

Ossiriand was a green and forested land, and it was not populated by the Sindar. In the early First Age before the rise of the Moon, a part of the Telerin elven people called Nandor entered Ossiriand under their leader King Denethor, and were given permission by Thingol to settle the lands.

After them the land was often renamed Lindon, for *The Singers*, after the old clan-name of the Telerin which the Nandor still used in their tongue. They became known as the Laegeldrim, or Green-elves.

The Elves of Ossiriand participated in the first battle of the Wars of Beleriand. After their leader Denethor was killed in an orc-raid they chose no more leaders, and many of them moved to Doriath. After the death of Thingol, Beren laid an attack against the Dwarves of Nogrod, leading an army of Nandorin Elves and Ents.

Ossiriand was the only part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath, but Belegaer the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain at the former riverbed of Ascar, creating the Gulf of Lhûn. In the Second Age and Third Age, the former lands of Ossiriand and Thargelion were known as **Lindon**, where Gil-galad the High King ruled.

## Etymology

The name ***Ossiriand*** means "Land of the Seven Rivers", from the Quenya *otso* ("seven"), Sindarin *sîr* ("river"),

## Other versions of the legendarium

While conceiving a name, J.R.R. Tolkien had numerous choices for this land. He originally wrote Broseliand (which eventually led to Beleriand). The other names were Colodhinand, Ñoldorinan, Geleriand, Bladorinand, Belaurien, Arsiriand, Lassiriand, and Ossiriand.
