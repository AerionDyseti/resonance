# Khand

**Khand** was the name of a land which lay to the south-east of Mordor and to the east of Near Harad that was inhabited by Variags.

## History
Almost nothing is known about Khand or its people, save that they were allied to Mordor.

Khand was, at least by the Third Age, under the influence of Mordor and was known to supply it with horses in place of Rohan, for Rohan refused to allow Sauron to buy their horses.

The peoples of Khand and of Rhûn seemed to have been enemies on and off throughout the ages. The Easterlings known as the Wainriders passed south of Mordor and made an alliance with the men of Khand and the Haradrim of Near Harad. In the year 1944 they made a coordinated attack against Gondor.

Years later, during the War of the Ring, Variags of Khand marched with the forces of Sauron to Minas Tirith and took part in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields as part of the Gothmog's division of the Morgul-host.
