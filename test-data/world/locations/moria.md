# Moria

**Khazad-dûm**, latterly known as **Moria** (Sindarin, "The Black Chasm", "The Black Pit"), was the grandest and most famous of the mansions of the Dwarves. There, for many thousands of years, a thriving Dwarvish community created the greatest city ever known. 

It lay in the central parts of the Misty Mountains, tunnelled and carved through the living rock of the mountains themselves. By the Second Age a traveller could pass through it from the west of the range to the east. 

## History
### Elder Days
It was founded in very ancient days by Durin who awoke at Mount Gundabad in the Misty Mountains. He came upon the valley Azanulbizar beneath the mountains. He looked into a shimmering lake and saw a crown of stars reflected in its waters. He named that lake Kheled-zâram, the Mirrormere and it remained a revered place among Dwarves of all houses ever afterwards, and the Durin's Stone was erected on the location of that event. 

There, in the caves above, Durin and his people started the delving and building of the Great Gates of Khazad-dûm, and the First Hall leading to a bridge over a chasm. From there began the expansion, both to *Levels* above and to *Deeps* below, and mines expanding out from the inhabited areas of the city proper.

As the centuries passed, the realm of Durin became the greatest of all their mansions, and became famous even to the distant west; the Elves of Beleriand, heard its rumour from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains on their borders. and his descendants continued to rule.

### Second Age

In c. , most of the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains began leaving en masse from their now ruined cities for Khazad-dûm. The city was enriched not just in numbers, but in the western Houses' skills in smithing, crafting and masonry. All these factors created a renaissance for Khazad-dûm, and brought its prosperity to its zenith.

Khazad-dûm had expanded so much that it completely traversed the Mountains from east to west, ending to the western rocky cliffs at their base, the Walls of Moria. Narvi with the Lord of Eregion, Celebrimbor, constructed the magical West-gate of Moria.

It was also during this time that the Orcs reinvaded the mountains and made war on the Dwarves, taking Mount Gundabad from the Kingdom of Durin.

### Third Age
#### Demise
Most of its great wealth was based on the rare *Mithril* that was found in its mines, and as the centuries passed, the Dwarves mined deeper and deeper for the precious metal. In the year , their deep digging unleashed a nameless terror, a Balrog from the Elder Days, that wreaked dreadful destruction, and in slaying the  King, Durin VI, became known as Durin's Bane. In the following year, Durin's son, Náin I, was also lost, and the Dwarves fled their ancient home. 

After millennia as one of the richest cities in Middle-earth, Khazad-dûm stood dark and empty, but for the brooding menace the Dwarves had released. In that time it was given a new name, Moria, the **Black Pit**.

The monster - a Balrog of Morgoth, as was later known - lurked alone in Moria for nearly five hundred years. After that time, around  Orcs made secret strongholds in the Mountains and Sauron started to populate the old city of Khazad-dûm with his creatures.

### Later history
Though little information is given, the retaking of Khazad-dûm by Durin VII seems to have occurred sometime after . As the King of Durin's Folk, he led a final return to the city. He was successful; the House of Durin reclaimed their inheritance and the hammers rang again in their great halls beneath the Misty Mountains until the race of Dwarves ended.

## Layout

Khazad-dûm was a huge array of chambers, passages, mines, halls, stores and pits. In general, areas were either classed as the *Mines of Moria* or the *city*. The mines were the working sections of Khazad-dûm whilst the city contained the habitable parts. The city of Moria was located close to the eastern end of Moria. were located close to the Great Gates. The North end was the part of Moria that had been excavated north of the older halls and the Great Gates and included the twenty first hall and the Chamber of Mazarbul with the tomb of Balin. They were structured into seven Levels and seven Deeps. The Levels stretched above the Great Gates with the First Level being on the same level as the Great Gates whilst the Deeps were set deeper within the mountain below the level of the Great Gates with the First Deep being immediately below the Great Gates. The First Deep included the Second Hall, which was no more than a quarter of a mile from the East-gate and a part of Old Moria. The eastern end was the part of Moria, which was just west of the East-gate. The First Hall was located on the same level as the East-gate Immediately to the east of the hall was the East-gate. or "Black Pit", being a combination of the elements *mor(n)* ("black") + *iâ* ("void, abyss"). The name was given by the Elves "without love", because they preferred to live above ground.

The presence of the name *Moria* on the West-gate of Moria is often seen as an inconsistency, but as just explained, the name had not necessarily bad connotations.

In the Noldorin phase of the Elvish language, *Moria* was glossed as "Black Gulf".

## Other names
The name *Khazad-dûm* in Khuzdul means "Dwarves' Mansion(s)". *Khazâd* being the plural of *khuzd* "Dwarves" while *dûm* (or possibly rather *tûm*) a word for "excavation(s), hall(s), mansion(s)" (it is not clear if the second word is in singular or plural form).

**Nornhabar** is a Sindarin name of Moria in The Later Quenta Silmarillion. Later on, in the essay *Quendi and Eldar*, *Nornhabar* was replaced by *Hadhodrûd* which was quite immediately changed to *Hadhodrond,* a form that entered into the printed Silmarillion. The elements of the Sindarin name are likely *Norno* "Dwarf" [*source?*] and *sabar* "mine".

The Sindar translated the Khuzdul name by sense into Sindarin as ***Hadhodrond***, which is a a compound of *hadhod* (an attempt by the Sindar to render *Khazâd*, the Dwarves' name for their own kind, into Sindarin sounds) ("Dwarf") and *rond* ("vault", "high roofed cavern").

The Noldor translated the Sindarin name into Quenya as ***Casarrondo*** ("Dwarrowvault"), and *rondo* ("vaulted hall", "cave").

***Phurunargian*** meaning "**Dwarrowdelf**" or "Dwarf-delving" was the Westron name for Khazad-dûm. Tolkien noted that the form *Phurunargian* was "archaic" Westron although he did not mention the elements that make it archaic (over a possible vernacular form). The word "**dwarrow**(**s**)" is the "expected" Modern English reflex of the Old English "dweorgas" (dwarfs/ves) before syntactic leveling produced "dwarfs".

The Primitive Elvish form of *Moria* was *Mornyā*.

:During the Moria levels the player for the most part controls Gandalf, only once is focus switched to Frodo instead.

**2004: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth*:**
:The entire journey through Moria takes place in one level, which can be completed in several minutes. The iconic location are portrayed immediately next to each other and in the end, Gandalf defeats the Balrog and continues journey with the Fellowship.

**2008: *The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria*:*'
:*Mines of Moria* was the first major expansion of the game, released in November 2008. Almost the entirety of Moria is present in the game, with players able to freely journey from the West Gate to the East Gate and from the Cliffs of Zirakzigil to the very Foundations of Stone where nameless things dwell.

:Moria is divided into several major sub-areas, depicted on the map to the right. **The Great Delving** lies directly next to the West Gate and links ancient Dwarven mines to palaces, academies and foundries founded during Khazad-dum's glory days. '''Durin's Way** is the area, where, according to legend, Durin himself first braved the mines before bringing his folk in there. **Zelem-Melek** is home to both numerous Orc encampments and the famed Twenty-first Hall. **Silvertine Lodes** refers to the mining area located directly under Silvertine, much like the **Redhorn Lodes** are the mining area under the peaks of Redhorn. **The Water-Works** hosts both a large underground lake and ancient Dwarven gears, wheels and devices that delivered the fresh water throughout the whole kingdom once. **The Flaming Deeps''' is an area that reeks with fire and where few could survive for long - it appears that Durin's Bane resided there following his reawakening. **Nud-Melek** mostly consists of the Second Hall and the First Hall. The **Foundations of Stone** are located below the deepest delving of the Dwarves; no light has ever shined there and, as Gandalf recounted, nameless things older than the world gnaw at the roots of the mountains.

:Surprisingly for those seeing it for the first time, Moria in *The Lord of the Rings Online* is very much inhabited. In an original storyline by Turbine, Dwarves from the Iron Hills sent by Dáin Ironfoot arrive in Moria shortly after the Fellowship to learn the fate of Balin's expedition. With Durin's Bane recently gone, the Orcs and Goblins of Moria are in great disarray, which allows the Dwarves to move in and establish encampments at all major crossroads. Fresh supplies are coming from both East and West gates, preventing the Iron Hill Garrison from being cut off like Balin was. Shortly after the defeat of Sauron at the end of the Third Age, the Iron Garrison was expelled from Moria by overwhelming numbers of orcs and evil creatures.

'*2009: *The Lord of the Rings: Conquest*:**
:Several levels of both good and evil campaigns take place in Moria.
