# Nan-tathren

**Nan-tathren**, also known as **Land of Willows**, was a region in Beleriand situated around both the Narog and Sirion rivers.
__NOTOC__
The land was of modest beauty and many willow trees grew there but had few inhabitants.

## History
After the defeat of the Union of Maedhros at the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, this had become one of the many places in Beleriand that Orcs and wolves roamed. In FA 511, shortly after the Fall of Gondolin, the survivors of the city, led by Tuor and Idril, camped here and made their respects to the fallen.

Voronwë is said to have been very wistful of this land and considered it to be the best part of Beleriand. Part of his motivation for attempting a voyage to Valinor was based upon the grounds that there were better forests there than Nan-tathren.

When Galadriel and Celeborn said farewell to Treebeard following the downfall of Barad-dûr, and Celeborn expressed his belief that they should not meet the Ent again, Galadriel stated that "*Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave* (Beleriand) *are lifted up again. **Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan** we may meet in the Spring," *

## Etymology
***Nan-Tathren*** was also called **The Land of Willows** or **Valley of the Willows**, and was ***Nan-tasarion*** ('Willow-meads') in Quenya.
