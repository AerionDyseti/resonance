# Undying Lands

__NOTOC__
The **Undying Lands** were a realm inhabited by Ainur and Eldar. The area included the continent of Aman and the island of Tol Eressëa. The ocean Belegaer separated the Undying Lands from the western shores of Middle-earth. With very few exceptions, only immortal beings were allowed to live in this realm.

## History
### Eldar Days and Second Age
Originally, mortals were allowed to trade with those from Valinor in the Undying Lands, but were forbidden to sail west beyond the sight of Númenor. However, in SA 3319, Sauron deceived Ar-Pharazôn, the King of Númenor, that the ruler of the Undying Lands would be granted immortality. To prevent the king's invasion, Ilúvatar sank Númenor beneath the ocean and set the Undying Lands forever beyond the reach of mortal Men. Elves were still permitted to sail across the sea to the Undying Lands, if they chose to (which most did).

### Third Age
In TA 3021, which is two years after the defeats of Sauron and Saruman, Círdan the Shipwright accompanied Elrond, Galadriel, and Gandalf, the Keepers of the Rings, on a voyage to the Undying Lands, where they intended to remain. They were also joined by Frodo and Bilbo Baggins, Hobbits who were known for bearing the One Ring. They were among the very few mortal beings to be allowed passage to the Undying Lands.

### Fourth Age
Eventually, the Hobbit Samwise Gamgee, the Dwarf Gimli, and the Elf Legolas, made the journey to the Undying Lands.

It is unknown how Manwë took to Gimli's arrival to Valinor, as, long earlier, he would have killed Eärendil for coming there uninvited, and only spared him because he came on behalf of Elves and Men.
