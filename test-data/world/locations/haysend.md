# Haysend

**Haysend** or **Hays-end** was a location at the southern tip of Buckland, at the place where the River Withywindle flowed out of the Old Forest into the Brandywine. It was named for the fact that it stood at the end of the High Hay, the Hedge raised to protect the Bucklanders from the strange things that lived in the Forest and beyond it. 

According to the poem "Bombadil Goes Boating", the inhabitants of the Hays-end and Breredon had a more fierce and protective attitude than most Hobbits, which is hardly surprising given the perilous location of their village.
## Etymology
The name means "hay's end", the end of the hedge or boundary-hedge.
## Other versions of the legendarium
It is not clear what is at the Haysend. Christopher Tolkien notes that in *A Part of the Shire* map the main road of Buckland stops right at Standelf and doesn't continue to Haysend, although a draft of *A Conspiracy Unmasked* mentions that road running "to Standelf and Haysend". No habitations are marked on the Map, nor in its previous drafts, although the poem *Bombadil Goes Boating* mentions inhabitants, as well as the village of Breredon.
