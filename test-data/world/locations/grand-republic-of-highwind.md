## Geography

Spanning approximately 2.4 million square kilometers, the Grand Republic encompasses a rich tapestry of diverse landscapes. From the wind-swept coasts of the eastern seaboard to the imposing peaks of the Crystal Spine mountains, the terrain varies dramatically. The central regions feature sweeping grasslands and fertile river valleys, while the western territories transition into rugged badlands and sun-scorched deserts. Each province's unique geographical features have profoundly influenced their cultural development, traditional industries, and economic specialties. The southern provinces benefit from temperate forests and rich mineral deposits, while the northern regions are characterized by dense woodlands and pristine lakes. These distinct environments continue to shape each province's role and influence within the unified nation, creating natural trade partnerships and occasional resource-based rivalries.

## History

The modern Grand Republic emerged from the tumultuous Unification Crusades—a series of military campaigns that united fifteen independent kingdoms into a single nation. Led by the charismatic General-King Marcus Highwind, these campaigns began as diplomatic efforts but devolved into full-scale warfare when peaceful negotiations failed. The fiercest resistance came from the Kaldo and Kumari provinces, where fighting lasted nearly a decade.

This violent past continues to shape modern politics and social dynamics. While each province maintains elements of its pre-unification identity, the extent of cultural expression faces strict regulation. The Preservation Acts, though ostensibly meant to protect provincial heritage, instead created a system of cultural suppression under the pretext of preventing inter-province conflict. These Acts established a framework that severely restricts traditional practices, with religious worship bearing the harshest limitations.

Despite claiming to protect "cultural heritage rights," the Acts make it virtually impossible to legally practice most traditions. Religious observance faces particular scrutiny, with the veneration of any specific deity effectively outlawed throughout the Republic. Though rural areas often quietly ignore these restrictions, they serve as a powerful tool for royal control through selective enforcement and "cultural compliance investigations." The Acts remain deeply contentious, with provincial nobles challenging their constitutionality while centralists defend them as vital for national unity.

The delicate balance between provincial autonomy and central authority manifests in various ways. The Council of Dukes meets quarterly to negotiate trade, resolve inter-provincial disputes, and advise on national policy. Recent decades have seen growing tension between traditionalist dukes seeking greater provincial independence and progressive nobles advocating for stronger federal oversight. This political divide regularly emerges in debates over taxation, military control, and educational standards.

## Culture

Highwind society places immense value on personal legacy and glory, prioritizing the narrative of achievements over their practical impact. This cultural focus on reputation has created a social ecosystem where appearance and story often outweigh reality. While urban centers strongly embrace this philosophy, rural communities tend to favor practical accomplishments and community welfare over individual renown.

This emphasis on legacy manifests in elaborate naming traditions, with individuals adopting ceremonial titles that reference their greatest achievements or aspirations. Noble families maintain extensive genealogies and commission elaborate portraits and histories, while wealthy merchants invest in public works bearing their names. Even middle-class citizens engage in this culture through "achievement ceremonies," publicly declaring their accomplishments and future ambitions.

The obsession with personal narrative has spawned a unique profession—the Legacy Scribes. These specialists craft and maintain personal histories, artfully embellishing achievements while discreetly obscuring failures. In urban centers, having a personal scribe has become a status symbol, sparking fierce competition among the most talented narrative crafters.

Yet this focus on individual glory faces criticism, particularly in rural areas where community interdependence remains vital for survival. Some provinces have developed alternative "collective legacy" traditions, attributing achievements to entire communities rather than individuals. These contrasting approaches to legacy and glory create tension between urban and rural populations, highlighting deeper divisions in how different regions interpret success and worth.

## Resources & Economy

The Grand Republic's economy is a sophisticated blend of regional specializations and diverse industries. The eastern provinces excel in maritime activities, including trade, shipbuilding, and fishing, while the central territories serve as the nation's agricultural heart with extensive farming, textile production, and livestock operations. In the western regions, wealth flows from mining, metallurgy, and gem extraction, and the northern provinces thrive on lumber production, fur trading, and specialized cold-weather agriculture.

A stark contrast exists between urban and rural economies. Cities have developed into refined commercial hubs featuring luxury manufacturing, sophisticated financial institutions, specialized artisan guilds, and international trading companies. Rural areas, meanwhile, maintain more traditional economic structures centered around subsistence farming, resource gathering, local craftwork, and small-scale manufacturing.

The nation's economy is notably divided between two distinct markets: the "Noble Market," which caters to aristocratic demands for imported luxuries and high-end services, and the "Common Market," which provides basic goods and necessities. Despite robust inter-provincial trade, the economy faces significant challenges, including provincial tariffs, competing currency valuations, historical trade rivalries, and uneven infrastructure development across regions.
