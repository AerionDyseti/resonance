# Dorthonion

**Dorthonion**, later **Taur-nu-Fuin** (also called **Taur-na-Foen** and **Deldúwath**), was a highland region of the First Age lying immediately to the north of Beleriand, and south of the plains of Ard-galen (later Anfauglith) bordering Morgoth's stronghold of Thangorodrim.

## Description

Dorthonion was 60 leagues east to west. In the north, it rose gradually from the plains, with great pine forests. The Ered Gorgoroth formed the southern boundary of Dorthonion, bending to the north on the east side to create the Pass of Aglond between Dorthonion and Hill of Himring. To the south and west of Dorthonion were the Echoriad, which surrounded the hidden Kingdom of Gondolin. The upper reaches of the River Sirion passed between the western slopes of Dorthonion and the Ered Wethrin. In the center of Dorthonion was a mountain named Orod-na-Thôn.

## History
Dorthonion was originally ruled by Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin, but it was overrun by Morgoth in the Dagor Bragollach and absorbed into his dark realm, Dor-na-Daerachas. Dorthonion was known afterwards as Taur-nu-Fuin, which translates as *Forest under Night* or *The Forest under the Shadow of the Night*.

The northeastern slopes of Dorthonion were known as Ladros, a fief given to Boromir of the House of Bëor. Here Barahir and his faithful XII Bëorings dwelt until they were all slain at Tarn Aeluin by Orcs sent by Sauron, save for Beren, Barahir's son in FA 460. Beren dwelt alone in the wilderness of Dorthonion for a time until he left for Doriath and met Lúthien.

Along with the other lands west of the Blue Mountains, Taur-nu-Fuin was mostly destroyed in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age. Afterwards, its highest points survived as the island **Tol Fuin** (Isle of Night), part of the Western Isles.

## Etymology

- Dorthonion* was a Sindarin name that meant 'land of pines'.

- Taur-na-Foen* is a Sindarin name meaning "Forest of the Foen", another name for Orod-na-Thôn.
