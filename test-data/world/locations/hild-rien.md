# Hildórien

**Hildórien** or **Murmenalda** was the land in which mankind first awoke, in the first year of the Sun of the First Age. The region was in the far east of Middle-earth southeast of  the Orocarni and Cuiviénen, the awakening place of the Elves. 

It is untold whether the region survived the tumults of the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age. 

## History

According to the Ambarkanta, before the War of the Powers Hildórien lay eastwards of the Mountains of the Wind. According to legends of the Edain, Morgoth visited Men in Hildórien and tricked them into believing their mortality was a punishment, in order to convert them away from Eru Ilúvatar. Mortality was however, a Gift of Ilúvatar bestowed upon them, not a punishment. To escape the evil of Morgoth and his followers, the Atanatári were the first to flee Hildórien, travelling west eventually to Beleriand. However, the Men that continued to worship Morgoth followed later on in the First Age with the promise that if they served him, they would receive the rich lands of Beleriand as payment.

With the War of Wrath the geography of Middle-earth was changed, it is not clear if Hildórien was submerged under the Eastern Sea or survived under another name, but it is not mentioned again.

## Etymology

***Hildórien*** is a Quenya name for 'Land of the Followers'. *Hildor* (meaning 'followers') was a name given to Men by Elves.
