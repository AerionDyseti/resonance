# Plain of Valinor

The **Plain of Valinor** was a vast plain in the land of Aman which accounted for the majority of the land west of the Pelóri.

It spanned more than two thousand miles from north to south, and over four hundred from east to west. 

## Description

On this plain were many of the Valar's lands and personal dwellings. Its most notable feature was the city of Valmar, located in the east-central part. South of Valmar were the Pastures of Yavanna and Woods of Oromë. Other features were the Gardens of Lórien, the Great Court of Aulë, and the dwelling of Nienna in the far west. Beneath the Plain of Valinor were the vast interconnecting tunnels that made up the Halls of Mandos. 

## Residents

Aside from the Valar and Maiar themselves, the Vanyar Elves were known to dwell here, when not at the foot of Taniquetil, while the Ñoldor were content in Tirion in the Calacirya pass.
