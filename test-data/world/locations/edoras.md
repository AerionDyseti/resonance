# Edoras

**Edoras** was the capital of Rohan that held the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 

## History
Rohan's first capital was at Aldburg in the Folde. Sometime after the battle of the Field of Celebrant (T.A. 2510), King Eorl the Young, or possibly his son Brego, built Edoras. In T.A. 2569, Brego built Meduseld, the Golden Hall. on the top of the hill on which Edoras was built.  

Wulf son of Freca the Dunlending, invaded Rohan in  and took Edoras, usurping the throne in Meduseld.  But the Long Winter, which had lasted five long months, ended and Fréaláf son of Hild came out of Dunharrow and with a small band of men, surprising Wulf, he attacked **Edoras** and slew Wulf, regaining the city.

It was here that Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf the White met with Théoden.

## Geography
The city was built on a hill in Harrowdale, a valley of the White Mountains which lay under the great mountain Starkhorn. The river Snowbourn flowed past Edoras on its way west towards the Entwash.

Edoras was encircled by a wall, with a dike dug around the hill. It had a spring whose water flowed in a channel along the main road.

Outside, there was the Barrowfield, with the tombs of the Rulers of Rohan arrayed in two rows by the time of the War of the Ring. Simbelmynë grew there. Through the two rows of the Barrowfield, a rutted road led from the city gates passed the Snowbourn.

## Etymology
The name *Edoras* is said to mean "the courts" in the Mark-speech of Rohan.

In Old English, *edoras* (plural of *edor, eodor*) means "dwellings, houses".

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series)**
:Edoras is featured in the second and the third film. It was built on Mount Sunday.

**2012: *The Lord of the Rings Online'''''
:Unlike many in-game settlements much smaller in size and prominence, Edoras is not considered a "capital" of its region. This is because early in the story Edoras is evacuated, with all inhabitants moving to Dunharrow, and for the majority of the game Edoras sits empty. Instead, Aldburg functions as the "capital settlement" of the Western Rohan, hosting the hub for swift travel and various player facilities.
