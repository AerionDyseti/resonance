# Araman

**Araman** was the narrow northern coastland of Aman, north of Valinor, that lay outside the mountain-fence of the Pelóri.

It was deserted, mountainous, and frozen because of its neighbouring with the Helcaraxë, joining it with Beleriand. The land may have consisted of tundra, but was dark in the age of the Two Trees, so might well have been totally desolate.

## History
Araman was the way Melkor, and later the Ñoldor, took after their exile. Araman was the place where the departing Ñoldor heard the Prophecy of the North from a dark figure standing on a rock. After hearing the doom that would lay upon them if they continued to rebel, the host divided into those following Fëanor who were resolved to return to Middle-earth after Morgoth to recover the Silmarils, and those who followed Finarfin who returned to Tirion and repented their rebellion and chose to live in peace ever after in the Undying Lands.

## Etymology
***Araman*** is a Quenya word that meant 'Outside Aman'. It contains the elements *Ar,* which means *outside of, alone*, and Aman, the continent that the Valar made and settled, and where they made the realm of Valinor
