# Goblin-town

**Goblin-town** was an Orc dwelling under the Misty Mountains, which was ruled by the Great Goblin.

Goblin-town was a series of tunnels and caverns, which went all the way through the mountains, with a "back door" near the Eagle's Eyrie in Wilderland, which served as a means of escape, and an access to the Wilderland. A cave with a lake was deep beneath Goblin-town yet was connected to the Orcs' tunnels, with one passage leading to the "back door".

## History
Long before the coming of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains, nameless things were living in the caves. travellers learned to avoid that dangerous road and the Orcs opened another under the safer High Pass: The Front Porch).

:One of the first new additions to the game after the initial release, Goblin-town proper is a large network of tunnels and caverns accessible from the eastern part of the Misty Mountains region. It is a labyrinthine network of hallways, bridges and caves with many side passages. Great Goblin's Throne Room and Gollum's Cave are two of the natural endpoints of the exploration. Goblin-town was revisited in the "Seat of the Great Goblin" group instance that greatly streamlined the layout with the focus on the Throne Room. Another version of Goblin-town is accessible from the eastern entrance in the Vales of Anduin region. This version also contains the Throne Room, with all three versions of it being slightly different from one another.
