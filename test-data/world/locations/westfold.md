# Westfold

The **Westfold** was a region of Rohan that was east of the Gap of Rohan and contained Helm's Deep. Its border with the Eastfold was marked by the Snowbourn River.

## History

Erkenbrand, Lord of the Westfold, rode with Gandalf to Helm's Deep to relieve Théoden's battered army.

In the War of the Ring, the Westfold was attacked by Saruman's Orcs of Isengard and men of Dunland, and several villages were burned down. Most of the people however had been sent to shelter in the Hornburg by Erkenbrand.
