# Kalórmë

**Kalórmë** was a great mountain in the middle of the Walls of the Sun on the continent of the Burnt Land of the Sun in the farthest east of Arda. The peak seems to have been the second tallest mountain in Arda, corresponding to Taniquetil far in the West.

## History
Kalórmë seems to have existed from the time after the destruction of the Two Lamps but does not appear on maps after the Change of the World as the Burnt Land of the Sun does not. When seen from afar, looking at it from Aman, it appeared dim. Oromë observed the peak at some point during the Hiding of Valinor. The Girdle of Arda runs across this peak.

## Etymology
- Kalórmë* is a Qenya name glossed as "hill crest over which the Sun rises" in the *Qenyaqetsa* or "sunrising-hill" in *The Poetic and Mythologic Words of Eldarissa*.

## Trivia
The name *Kalórmë* is similar to that of Calormen found in C. S. Lewis' world of Narnia.
