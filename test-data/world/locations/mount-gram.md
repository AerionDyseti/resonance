**Mount Gram** was a mountain of Middle-earth, likely located in Eriador, known to contain one or more Orc-holds inhabited by Orcs.

## History

The mountain was long inhabited by a group of Orcs led by Golfimbul. They terrorized some inhabitants of eastern Eriador, including those of the Shire.

In TA 2747, they attacked the Shire and caused the Battle of the Green Fields. The invaders were defeated by hobbits led by Bandobras Took, who personally slew Golfimbul.
