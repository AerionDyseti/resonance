# Mithrim

**Mithrim** was a region of Hithlum in Middle-earth during the First Age.

## Description
Mithrim was the south-eastern corner of Hithlum, and was divided by the Mountains of Mithrim from Dor-lómin to the west. Mithrim's climate was likely either a subarctic/boreal or humid/hemiboreal climate.

## History
This area was the location of the Dagor-nuin-Giliath between the forces of Fëanor and the Orcs of Morgoth.

The area was home to a great lake, the Lake of Mithrim, which was the body of water north of Beleriand where the Ñoldor first dwelt in Middle-earth: the Sons of Fëanor on the northern shore and Fingolfin's host on the southern shore. In YS 7, a council was held here and the Ñoldor chose Fingolfin to be their king.

The Ñoldor dwelt here for a while until their feud was healed, and they removed to other lands. Mithrim was also home to Sindar Elves, who soon mingled with the Ñoldor after they had learned Sindarin.

Later in the First Age, Mithrim was ruled by Fingolfin, as it formed the most densely populated part of Hithlum.
