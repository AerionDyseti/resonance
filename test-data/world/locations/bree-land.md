# Bree-land

__NOTOC__

**Bree-land** was a small, inhabited region of central Eriador located between the Midgewater Marshes, the South Downs and the Barrow-downs.

## Description
Bree-land was a little country of undulating lowlands and tamed, scattered woodlands only a few miles broad. It was an island of civilization surrounded on all sides by empty wilderness. Its dwellings were clustered around the slopes of Bree-hill, the most prominent point in the area. There was a small forest named the Chetwood in the north, a deep valley in the east, and hill fields in the south where pipe-weed was grown.  

The town of Bree was the chief settlement of the land. Bree was surrounded by multiple villages including Combe, Staddle, and Archet, home to a mixed population of both Men and Hobbits.

The climate was likely moderate with warm and moist prevailing winds from the Sea. The prevailing language of the land was likely Westron.

Bree-land was about twenty-five miles in diameter. Normally, it could be approached by the East-West Road coming out of the Shire in the west, and by the Greenway from north or south. Near the eastern border of Bree-land, constructed along the East-West Road, lay the Last Inn, the final outpost as one entered the wild and desolate Lone-lands.

## History
The area was settled in the Second Age by Men from Dunland. Surviving the wars and chaos of that time, it became part of the kingdoms of Arnor then Arthedain and then maintained a certain independence under the secret protection of the Rangers of the North. After the Great War of the Ring, Bree-land became a protectorate of the Reunited Kingdom and presumably prospered well into the Fourth Age.

## Other versions
In early drafts of , there was a fifth settlement, Crick, mentioned alongside Staddle and Combe as neighboring villages. In a note, Christopher Tolkien noted that while both Crick and Staddle did not appear in the next draft, only Staddle eventually reappeared.

## In adaptations
The video game  gives its own broader definition of Bree-land. The game counts Buckland, Midgewater Marshes, Old Forest, and the Barrow-downs as within its boundaries.
