# Staddle

**Staddle** was a village in Bree-land. It was located on the gentler south-eastern slopes of Bree-hill. Staddle was the main settlement of the Bree-hobbits.

## History
On 29 September , there were some hobbits of the the Underhill Family from Staddle in *The Prancing Pony* in Bree. That night Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took arrived at the inn and Frodo introduced himself as "Mr. Underhill" to Barliman Butterbur, the innkeeper. When Barliman introduced "Mr. Underhill" to the other guests in the common-room, he attracted their interest.

Frodo and his companions left with Strider the next morning and most of the inhabitants from Staddle were crowded on the road in Bree to watch their departure. Having walked for some miles on the East Road, Aragorn and the Hobbits could see later the houses and hobbit-holes north of the East Road on the south-eastern slopes of Bree-hill.

## Etymology
The name *Staddle* is a dialectical English name, which is derived from Old English *stathol* (*staðol*), which means "foundation" (of buildings, sheds, ricks, etc.) and occurs in real-life English place-names.

## Portrayal in adaptations
