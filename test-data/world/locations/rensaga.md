# Írensaga

**Írensaga** was a tall mountain with a series of saw-toothed peaks situated within the White Mountains in Rohan.

Alongside the Starkhorn and the Dwimorberg, Írensaga was part of the juncture which formed the great shelf Dunharrow was on in the valley of Harrowdale in Rohan.

## Etymology
- Írensaga* is a name in Old English representing a Rohanese name meaning "iron-saw" in reference to the serrated ridge atop the mountain's summit.

## In other versions
In earlier drafts of , Tolkien wrote ***Irensaga*** without an accent over the "I" and did not include a hyphen in the translation of the name. While it is untold why Tolkien added the accent, it is possible that the first word *Íren* is meant to correspond with *Īren* ("iron") to make for a long "i" sound, rather than a short one with an unaccented *iren*.
