# March of Maedhros

The **March of Maedhros** was an Elven realm in East Beleriand between Dorthonion and the Blue Mountains next to Maglor's Gap.

It consisted of a series of hills and plains.

## History

The March of Maedhros was fortified by Maedhros after he moved his brothers and their people out of Hithlum further east to avoid any feuds with their kinsmen. He established himself on the hill of Himring. It withstood the frequent attacks by the forces of Angband throughout the First Age, standing strong in the Battles of Beleriand including the ravages of the Dagor Bragollach. It was finally overrun during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in FA 473.
