# Emyn Muil

alt=|thumb|300px|The Emyn Muil in Peter Jackson's __NOTOC__
The hills of **Emyn Muil**, upon either side of Nen Hithoel, were a vast, seemingly impenetrable maze of crags situated in the region of Rhovanion in Middle-earth.

The Emyn Muil lay between the Eastemnet of Rohan and the relatively empty lands that contained the Dead Marshes and the Nindalf. It was approximately seventy-five miles from east to west and some one-hundred miles from north to south. The western boundary of Emyn Muil and eastern border of Rohan were formed by the East Wall of Rohan, a great, natural rocky cliff running in a curve from north to south.

## History
The Emyn Muil had once marked the northern borders of the Kingdom of Gondor at its height.

In TA 3002, Éomund, father of Éomer and Éowyn, was slain while pursuing a band of Orcs near Emyn Muil.

At the beginning of , Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee, attempting to reach the Black Gate of Mordor, are lost in the eastern Emyn Muil for days until Gollum finds them. After a great deal of persuasion, he agrees to show them the way to the Gate, leading them south into the Dead Marshes.
