# Waste

The **Waste** was a region somewhere in Middle-earth, possibly to the east of the Misty Mountains.

## History
After the Battle of Five Armies, Bard gave a large amount of gold to the Master of Lake-town to help the Lake-men recover. However, the Master caught the dragon-sickness, stole most of the gold, and fled with it from Lake-town. In a slightly later version, the Master died of starvation within the waste without any companions being mentioned. The word *waste* was uncapitalized in all of those versions. has suggested that *Waste* may possibly have been another name for the Desolation of Smaug, though how he came to this conclusion is unknown.
