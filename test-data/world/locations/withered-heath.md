# Withered Heath

The **Withered Heath** was a region at the eastern extreme of the Grey Mountains in Middle-earth. There, the Grey Mountains broke into two spurs, north and south, between which was the Heath which was thought to have been the home of dragons.

## History
In the eastern part of their length, the Grey Mountains forked into two thin ranges, with a narrow valley between. On the floor of this long east-west valley between the mountains was a heath, but a heath burned and blackened by its inhabitants. This heath was famed and feared in the north of Middle-earth as the breeding-ground of the dragons. At one time they had infested the Grey Mountains and the lands beyond, and even in the closing decades of the Third Age, the dragon Smaug still terrorized the inhabitants of the north.

Smaug was the last of the great dragons, but lesser members of his kind remained, so perhaps these still occasionally returned to the Withered Heath to continue their race. However, in TA 2941 Thorin spoke of the Withered Heath as the place 'where the great dragons bred', implying that it was by then deserted, or at least not frequented by dragons that could be described as 'great'.

## In adaptations

The Withered Heath appears as a location in the *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II* video game. In Level Six of the Evil Campaign, the forces of Mordor from Dol Guldur march to the Withered Heath, led by the Mouth of Sauron, in hopes of gaining the allegiance of the dragons' leader, Drogoth the Dragon Lord. By killing the Dwarven forces and freeing the imprisoned offspring, Drogoth agrees to fight for Sauron with the promise of a Ring of Power, stolen many years ago from the Dwarves. The Withered Heath is also a playable skirmish battlefield.
