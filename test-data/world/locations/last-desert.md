# Last Desert

The **Last Desert** was a mysterious (possibly fictional) location in Middle-earth.

## Description
Hobbit folklore described the Last Desert as being in the "East of East" and inhabited by wild Were-worms.

## Speculation
No factual accounts of such a place exist. However, Hobbit folklore frequently had some elements of truth in it, such as the stories of the Oliphaunts. It is possible that in the unexplored lands east of the Orocarni or in Far Harad, there was a desert realm inhabited by dragon-like monsters.
