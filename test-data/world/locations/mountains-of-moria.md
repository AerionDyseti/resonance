# Mountains of Moria

The **Mountains of Moria** were three great peaks in the Misty Mountains: Celebdil, Caradhras, and Fanuidhol, below which was the realm of Khazad-dûm.

## Description & history

The three peaks were within a few dozen miles of each other and formed part of the Misty Mountains, and below them was once founded the Dwarven city and delvings of Khazad-dûm. The primary section of Khazad-dûm, later named *Moria*, seems to have been beneath Celebdil, or *Zirakzigil*, which was crowned by Durin's Tower.

In the Quest of the Ring, the Fellowship of the Ring attempted to take the Redhorn Pass in order to cross the mountains to the east, but were forced by Caradhras to instead journey through Moria.
