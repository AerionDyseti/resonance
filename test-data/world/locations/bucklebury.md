# Bucklebury

**Bucklebury** was the chief village of Buckland, lying in the shadow of Buck Hill, seat of the Master of Buckland. It was built about a mile east of the banks of the River Brandywine.

The Bucklebury Ferry was a passage across the Brandywine between Bucklebury and the Marish.
## Etymology
The name means Buck-burg, or Buck-town (*buck* always means male goat or deer).

Tolkien notes that it's "Buck*le*bury" rather than plain "Buckbury" because the word is either an alteration of earlier *Bucken-bury* (Bucken being archaic plural) or a reduction of ***Buckl**and*.

Based on this, David Salo has suggested that Bucklebury represents a possible Old Hobbitish form **Buccanburh* "Bucca's burg".
