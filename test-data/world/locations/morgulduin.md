# Morgulduin

**Morgulduin** was a river of Ithilien, which began in the Ephel Dúath and flowed through the Morgul Vale, under the ghastly bridge that led into Minas Morgul, and eventually into the Anduin. Because it originated in the Morgul Vale, it was icy-cold and its waters were polluted and not safe to drink from.

In the year TA 3019, Faramir warned Frodo and Sam not to drink from it, as the water was tainted and would harm whoever imbibed it.

## In adaptations
The Morgulduin appears, though it is not named, in Peter Jackson's *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* as a wide, polluted river adjacent to Minas Morgul.

## Etymology

***Morgulduin*** was a Sindarin word that meant 'Black-magic River'. The name Ithilduin means 'Moon River'. It is unknown if the name reverted during the Fourth Age.
