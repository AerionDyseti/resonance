## History

Lothlann lay to the northeast of Beleriand, bordered on the south by the March of Maedhros. Its eastern edge drew up to the Blue Mountains north of Mount Rerir, and in the west it bordered on the highlands of Dorthonion and, just north of this, the plain of Ard-galen. During most of the First Age, Lothlann was watched over by light cavalry under the command of the Sons of Fëanor, mainly Maglor and Maedhros. In the Wars of Beleriand, Orcs, Glaurung, and other fell beasts crossed Lothlann in order to assault East Beleriand.

Ultimately, Lothlann was drowned in the Great Western Sea at the end of the First Age as a result of the War of Wrath.
