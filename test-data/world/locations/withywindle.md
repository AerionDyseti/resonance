# Withywindle

The **Withywindle** was the lesser tributary of the Brandywine River that flowed through the Barrow-downs and the Old Forest and passed into Buckland on the borders of the Shire. The Dingle, the valley of the Withywindle, was said to be the source of all the strange occurrences in the Old Forest. Tom Bombadil lived here in his house on top of a hill between the Barrow-downs and Old Forest.

## History
According to hobbit folklore, Tom Bombadil met Goldberry, the River-daughter, in a pool down the Withywindle. He later brought her to his home north of the river and every summer would gather water-lilies for her along the river side. He was on his last trip of the year when he met Frodo Baggins and the rest of his company on September 26, 3018.

When Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin were passing through the valley of the Withywindle, they encountered Old Man Willow, an ancient tree who showed bitter hatred to all other living creatures in Middle-earth people and trees alike. The Hobbits were lulled to sleep under his spell all except Frodo and Sam who regained consciousness in time to save Merry and Pippin who had been trapped inside the old willow's trunk. Tom Bombadil happened to be strolling along the river at the time and rescued them all by demanding that he let them go.

## Geography
The river was about three miles in length and began at a waterfall that probably cut into the cliff at the edge of the Barrow-downs near the house of Tom Bombadil.

At the mouth of the Withywindle there was a haven in the north bank called Grindwall. The Grindwall was not under the protection of the High Hay therefore it was guarded by a fence that was built extending into the water's shallows. There was a small village called Breredon on the other side of the Grindwall between the Brandywine and the High Hay.

## Etymology
The word ***withy*** means'' 'willow** (common element in English place-names) and ***windle*** meaning **spindle** or **reel** and is supposed to be translated from Hobbit-speech.

## In adaptations

In , as Withywindle flows through the Old Forest, signs of long-abandoned habitation can be found along its shores.
