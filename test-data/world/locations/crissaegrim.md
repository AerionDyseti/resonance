# Crissaegrim

The **Crissaegrim** formed a part of the southern Echoriad and were home to the Great Eagles of Thorondor. 

The great Eagles moved to the Crissaegrim after Morgoth's return to Thangorodrim. It was here that Thorondor, the Lord of the Eagles lived, and from here he watched for spies attempting to find the hidden city of Gondolin in the vale of the River Sirion.

## Etymology

***Crissaegrim*** is Sindarin for "cleft mountain peaks", but in Tolkien's stories the place is usually referred to as **Cirith Thoronath**, the "Eagles' Cleft", or "Abode of Eagles" because the peaks were inaccessible from the ground.
