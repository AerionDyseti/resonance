# Caradhras

**Caradhras**, also called the **Redhorn** and **Barazinbar**, was one of the mightiest peaks in the Misty Mountains. A pass crossed over it and it was the most southerly point at which the Misty Mountains could be crossed.

## Description
Caradhras was one of the Mountains of Moria, the three mountains under which the great Dwarf city of Khazad-dûm was built. It was also the only site in Middle-earth where mithril could be mined. But mining ever deeper into the roots of the mountain in search of mithril, the Dwarf miners unwittingly awakened the Balrog of Moria.

Caradhras was called *the Cruel* by the Dwarves and had long had a bad reputation, for they thought that the mountain was sentient, and purposefully drove off and killed travelers.

In the Quest of the Ring, the Fellowship attempted to cross the Redhorn Pass, lying beneath the slopes of Caradhras, but were met with harsh weather and falling rocks, prompting them to turn back. Gimli attributed this to Caradhras itself, calling upon a malevolent force to stop them out of an apparent dislike of Dwarves and Elves. Gandalf however suspected that Sauron's power was at work. In Khuzdûl, it is known as *Barazinbar*, from *baraz* ("red") and *-inbar* ("horn"). 

## In adaptations
### In *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's  film, the Fellowship is trying to cross Caradhras in a blizzard, Saruman utters enchantments in Quenya from the top of Orthanc in Isengard to prevent them from crossing the mountain by causing massive boulders to plummet down from the mountain and lightning to strike the mountain, sending a mass of snow cascading down and burying the Fellowship. This differs from the book, in which it is suggested that an ancient evil born from the mountain itself was sending the foul weather to hinder the group's passage; or that it could have been the work of Sauron, from afar. Gandalf himself responds to Gimli's questioning of Sauron's reach, to which Gandalf says, "It has grown long."

## In popular culture
