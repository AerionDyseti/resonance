# Harnen

The river **Harnen** ("**Southing**"** **in Westron) was a river south of Gondor.

## Description

The Harnen formed the southern border of the contested land of Harondor, also known as south Gondor, and as such formed the southern border of Dúnedain influence. South of the Harnen lay the land of Near Harad.

Roughly 600 Númenórean miles long, it began in the Ephel Dúath of Mordor and then flowed southwest for about 350 miles, when it bent west and sped to Belegaer, which it entered in a wide delta. The Harad Road crossed the Harnen into Harad shortly after it bent westwards. This road was used by Sauron's followers later in the Third Age.

In the first millennium of the Third Age, King Ciryaher stormed across the Harnen with a large army and routed the Men of Harad. The Haradrim were thereafter compelled to acknowledge Gondor's overlordship over their people. Ciryaher thereafter took the name *Hyarmendacil*, meaning "South-victor".

## Etymology

***Harnen*** is a Sindarin word that meant "South-water".
