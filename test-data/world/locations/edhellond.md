# Edhellond

**Edhellond** was an ancient harbour in southern Gondor. It had been established south-west of where the Ringló entered the Morthond, near where the combined waters flowed into Cobas Haven.

## History
Edhellond was founded in the late First Age by seafaring Sindar from the west havens of Beleriand who fled in three small ships when the power of Morgoth overwhelmed the Eldar and the Edain; but it was later increased by adventurers of the Silvan Elves seeking for the sea who came down Anduin.

During his sea voyage of -9 to the coasts of Middle-earth, Aldarion, the grandson of King Tar-Elendil of Númenor, looked at the "country of Amroth where the Nandor Elves still dwell" which included Edhellond.

From Edhellond, Elves began sailing westward from the time of the fall of Eregion in .  

Around , with the freeing of the Balrog in Moria, many of the Galadhrim fled south to Edhellond and sailed over the Sea to Valinor. Amroth, King of Lórien, was lost at sea near Edhellond in  when he attempted to swim to shore to seek his beloved Nimrodel. The ship from which he jumped overboard was the last ship of Elves to leave from Edhellond. The haven was deserted from then on,

## Other versions of the legendarium
Another account, in an unfinished note on the origin of the name *Belfalas*, states that the haven was established in the early Second Age by Elves from Lindon. They were a remnant of the people of Doriath who still harboured a grudge against the Noldor.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2014: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Although Edhellond itself is abandoned, a small group of Elves, the "Avorrim" still live in nearby caves in secret, known only to the ruling line of Dol Amroth. They maintain a watch over Edhellond as, should the unthinkable happen and the access to the Grey Havens be lost, it would remain the only place in Middle-Earth from which the Elves could sail into the West. During the War of the Ring the Corsairs of Umbar who blockade Dol Amroth dock many of their ships in Edhellond, which becomes one of their staging areas.
