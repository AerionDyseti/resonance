# Ethir Anduin

The **Ethir Anduin**, also known as the **Ethir**, '''Anduin's Mouths**, and the **Mouths of Anduin''', was the delta formed by the river Anduin's egress into the Bay of Belfalas, and thus into the Great Sea of Belegaer. It was within southern Gondor, near the great harbor of Pelargir in Lebennin. It was considered one of the fiefs of the Outlands.

## History
The delta's earliest inhabitants were probably the Nandor. Some of the Nandor who had originally lived upstream in woodlands within the Vales of Anduin before the Misty Mountains, traveled southward until they reached the Anduin's mouth, where they made dwellings.

After the Nandor had gone, the land became settled by "lesser men", though they were likely in conflict with Haradrim. After the coming of the Númenóreans, the confluence of cultures in the Ethir and Pelargir formed one of the earliest forms of Westron. The Númenóreans made a passage through the Ethir to be taken by ships going to and from Pelargir.

The Ethir was formed after the Downfall of Númenor when the great storms in the island kingdom's drowning changed the shape of the coast. The shores of the Bay of Belfalas had retreated a great distance, putting Pelargir much farther inland than it had been originally. This led the Anduin to carve a new path into the bay through many mouths.

In the days following the founding of Gondor, the delta became an important area under the control of the new kingdom. Those Gondorians that lived there were mainly fisherman and sea-crafty folk who went out to the Belegaer on boats. Fishing had been the most profitable business in the Anduin's Mouths for generations, and fish the main food source. to aid in the defense of Minas Tirith. This left the Mouths themselves open to conquest by Umbar, but the occupation did not last very long; Aragorn and the Grey Company liberated it several days later. delta") and *Anduin* ("Long river").
