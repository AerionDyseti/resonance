# Dor Dínen

**Dor Dhínen**, the **Silent Land**, was a small, roughly triangular, deserted part of East Beleriand, north of Doriath.

Contained by one of the upper courses of the Esgalduin (bordering Nan Dungortheb) and the Aros (bordering Himlad), it was said that no one had lived there for ages. The region was crossed by a road passing from the Iant Iaur on the Esgalduin to the Arossiach on the Aros that led to the northern marches of Himlad. The southern edge of Dor Dhínen consisting of the words *dôr* ("dwelling-place, region where certain people live; land") and *d(h)ínen* from the elements *dîn* ("silence; quiet") and *-en*
