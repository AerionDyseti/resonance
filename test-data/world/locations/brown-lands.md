# Brown Lands

The **Brown Lands** were a devastated region of Rhovanion.  They were bordered by the Emyn Muil in the south, Mirkwood in the north, and the River Anduin in the west.

## History

Historically, the lands were fertile plains where the Entwives gardens were located. The land was ruined by Sauron as a defense against the advance of the Allies, and the Entwives were driven away. When the Fellowship traveled by boat down the Anduin during the War of the Ring, on the eastern shore they could see nothing but barren, withered slopes without even scrub or grass. The western shore was lined with reeds, and the land was flat with some patches of grass.  Even Aragorn could not say what had caused such desolation. The only living things they could see were birds, though there were few. The Company also saw black swans - spies of Sauron - flying overhead.

## In adaptations
