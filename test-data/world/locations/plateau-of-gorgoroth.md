# Plateau of Gorgoroth

The **Plateau of Gorgoroth**, or simply **Gorgoroth**, was a region located in the northwestern portion of Mordor.

## Geography

The Plateau of Gorgoroth stood at the heart of the dark lands of Mordor, and was where most of Sauron's armies lay in wait for their master's command. Gorgoroth was a vast wasteland southeast of the Isenmouthe and Udûn that had been seared by the eruptions of Mount Doom. It was always covered in the volcanic ash of Mount Doom and had no plant growth save for the Brambles of Mordor. A few streams of brackish water descended from the Ephel Dúath and Ash Mountains, but either petered out or flowed into cisterns dug for the use of Sauron's armies. The Plateau of Gorgoroth was arid with extreme climates and was considered to be uninhabitable by Men or perhaps by anything else living.

- The Atlas of Middle-earth* by Karen Wynn Fonstad suggests that the uplift of the Plateau of Gorgoroth was linked to the formation of Mount Doom. In particular, the author suggests that, according the descriptions, the landscape of this region was composed by basaltic rocks and ashes erupted by the volcano.

## History

During the War of the Ring, the Plateau of Gorgoroth was the location of mines and forges which supplied Mordor's armies with weapons and armor. Frodo and Sam looked upon Gorgoroth and passed through it on their way to Mount Doom between March 16 and March 24, TA 3019.

During Return of the King, the One Ring tempts Samwise Gamgee with a vision once the Hobbit retrieves the Ring. The vision showcases Sam turning the barren plateau into a verdant garden of flowers with ripe fruit trees.
