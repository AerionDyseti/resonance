# Umbar

**Umbar** was a realm on the coast south of Gondor in Middle-earth. It included a great cape and a land-locked firth, which formed a natural haven. The name Umbar was used in conjunction with it being made into a great fortress, it being laid siege to or it being invested. Since these statements imply a small fortified area, it is probable that Umbar was also the name of a fortified city in this realm.

## Geography
Umbar was located south of the mouth of the river Anduin at the Bay of Belfalas in a natural haven that was formed by a peninsula that extended west from the coast of the Belegaer sea and then bent to the south and almost touched the coast that lay to its south. This form of the coastline left only a narrow entrance to the natural haven. The City of the Corsairs was at the easternmost point of the bay of Umbar.

Umbar was the nearest of the realms of the Southrons to Gondor.

It is possible that Umbar had a climate that was fluctuating between mild winters and very hot and dry summers. It is also possible that Umbar had a vegetation of sparse woodlands, because Umbar seems to have had the natural resources to build a fleet of fifty great ships and smaller vessels beyond count that had attacked Pelargir during the War of the Rings thirtynine years after Aragorn had burnt a great part of the ships of the Corsairs in the haven of Umbar.

## History
### Foundation and Númenórean rule
It is possible that the bay of Umbar was discovered by Aldarion, the son of the Númenórean king Tar-Meneldur when Aldarion scarcely escaped shipwreck in the Harad during a voyage with three ships, which lasted from  to . After Sauron heard that Aldarion had become a great shipbuilder who sailed his ships to haven far down into the Harad, he chose Mordor as a stronghold to counter the threat of landings by the Númenoreans.

After Sauron was defeated by an alliance of the Númenóreans and the Elves of Lindon and Eriador in the War of the Elves and Sauron during the reign of Queen Tar-Telperiën in , he retreated from the coasts of Middle-earth and did not dare to challenge the Númenóreans for a long time.

Until the end of the reign of the Númenórean king Tar-Minastir in , the Númenóreans came to Middle-earth as teachers and friends of the local population.

Approximately in  the Númenóreans began to establish dominions on the coasts, which possibly already included Umbar. It is possible that the son of Tar-Minastir, Ciryatan sailed to Umbar, because he voyaged south before he took the sceptre from his father in .

During the reign of the Númenórean kings Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir, who were both greedy for wealth, the Númenóreans formed two parties, the party of the Faithful, who remained faithful to the Valar and maintained their friendship with the Elves and the party of the King's Men, who followed the policy of the King to oppose the Ban of the Valar that forbade to sail to Aman and did not maintain the friendship with the Elves. The King's Men sailed far away to the south of Middle-earth and established lordships and strongholds in Umbar, Harad and many other places on the coasts of Middle-earth. The Númenóreans in the service of Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir oppressed the men of Middle-earth and levied heavy tribute from the men of the coasts and their ships brought back metals and gems from Middle-earth. It is possible that Umbar was an important point from which tributes and other resources were shipped to Númenor.

After the Ringwraiths had appeared around the year  and after the terror and mastery of Sauron over Men in Middle-earth had grown, Sauron began to attack the strongholds of the Númenóreans on the coasts of Middle-earth, 
but he was not yet able to conquer Umbar.

Before he had married the queen of Númenor Tar-Míriel and ursurped her throne, the Númenórean king Ar-Pharazôn had been a leader in the wars of the Númenóreans on the coasts of Middle-earth. During this time in Middle-earth he became aware of the strength of the realm of Sauron and of Sauron's hatred against Númenor. After his ursurpation of the throne, Ar-Pharazôn received reports that Sauron was attacking with his might, was pressing down on the cities by the coasts and had openly declared to intend to drive the Númenóreans into the sea and to destroy Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn prepared an army and an armada of ships. In , Ar-Pharazôn landed with his armada at Umbar, marched with his army for seven days, and commanded Sauron to swear fealty to him. Sauron thought that he could not win by force, so he came and humbled himself before Ar-Pharazôn and was taken as a hostage to Númenor. Umbar was remembered ever after with pride as the site of the landing of the Númenórean army that had humiliated Sauron.

After the Downfall of Númenor, Umbar remained in the hands of the Númenóreans, in essence a realm-in-exile alongside Arnor and Gondor. But unlike these others, Umbar had been settled by the King's Men, who were afterwards called the Black Númenóreans, who hated the Faithful Númenórean survivors of Arnor and Gondor. Not all the servants of Sauron were killed at the end of the War of the Last Alliance Some of them were routed and dispersed and many remembered Sauron in their hearts and hated Arnor and Gondor.

### Umbar as part of Gondor
Gondor's King Eärnil I repaired the haven of Pelargir, built a great navy and besieged Umbar by land and by sea. Umbar was only taken at great cost, because its Black Númenórean inhabitants as descendants of the King's Men inherited their hatred of Gondor as a realm of the followers of Elendil In  Ciryandil was killed in the siege of Umbar.

When King Valacar of Gondor grew old there was already a rebellion in the southern provinces. Some of the Dúnedain refused to accept his son Eldacar as their future King, because Eldacar had been born in a foreign country, had been named Vinitharya in a foreign language in his youth and they feared that Eldacar would have a shorter life, because his mother, who came from a foreign country and who they perceived to be of a "lesser" race had only had a short life compared to the longer life of the Dúnedain. After the death of King Valacar in , a civil war, called the Kin-strife, began in Gondor. In , It is possible that the rebels took their wives and families with them to Umbar; they had held out long with others of their kin in Pelargir and were able to gather people at Pelargir because Eldacar had no ships to besiege Pelargir by sea. Umbar remained at war with Gondor for many lives of men and was a threat to the coastlands of Gondor and to all traffic on the sea. The region of South Gondor became a debatable land between the kings of Gondor and the Corsairs of Umbar.

In , King Aldamir was killed in a war with the Harad and the Corsairs of Umbar. Hyarmendacil II defeated the Men of the Harad

The leaders of the Corsairs of Umbar, Angamaitë and Sangahyando, the great-grandsons of Castamir, learned through spies that Minardil, the King of Gondor, was in the Gondorian port of Pelargir and that he did not suspect any danger, because his father had crushed Harad and Umbar. the Corsairs of Umbar, led by Angamaitë and Sangahyando, made a raid up the river Anduin, killed Minardil in Pelargir, ravaged Pelargir and the coasts and escaped with great booty. and drove out the Corsairs in . because his grandfather Teluhmetar had captured Umbar and smashed the power of the Corsairs and the peoples of Harad were occupied with wars and feuds of their own. From that year to , Gondor enjoyed a respite from war. In , because assistance from Umbar for an attack on Ithilien by enemies proceeding from Near Harad was not avaible. In the autumn of , King Eärnil II felt sufficiently secure to be able to send aid to Arthedain and sent an army of power for a war of great kings, although it was just a small force of the whole army of Gondor, on so many ships that they could scarcely find harbourage, although they filled the Grey Havens, Harlond and Forlond. It seems unlikely that King Eärnil II would have felt sufficiently secure to send away such a large fleet from Gondor to the aid of Arthedain if he would have feared an attack on Gondor by ships from Umbar. It also seems unlikely that Gondor would not have been able to hold Umbar when it still had a fleet and a mighty army, because Umbar could not be taken in the past in the days of King Ciryaher during a siege by the Men of Harad that lasted for many years, because of the power of the fleet of Gondor. the Corsairs of Umbar attacked the coasts of Gondor.

In , the 15th Prince of Dol Amroth was killed by the Corsairs of Umbar.

The Corsairs spent a long time to prepare a great fleet. In  three fleets sailed from Umbar and Harad and landed at many places along the coasts of Gondor and even at the mouth of the river Isen and at the mouth of the river Lefnui. The troops from Umbar and Harad helped the Dunlendings who were led by Wulf, the son of Freca, a lord with wide lands on both sides of the river Adorn who was said to have much Dunlending blood and who had been killed by King Helm of Rohan, to invade Rohan from the west over the river Isen and down from Isengard. 

After the second arising of Sauron, Umbar fell under the domination of the servants of Sauron and the great white pillar that had been built on the highest hill of the headland above the haven by the followers of Elendil as a monument for the humiliation of Sauron by Ar-Pharazôn was thrown down. It is possible that king Elessar completely subdued Umbar

## Culture
### Politics and rule
It is not known how the Númenórean colony of Umbar was ruled before the Downfall of Númenor when it was a stronghold of the King's Men who were afterwards called the Black Númenóreans. No "King of Umbar" is mentioned in the Annals of the Kings and Rulers after the Down fall of Númenor. It is possible that the Black Númenóreans regarded the Heirs of Elendil as usurpers. It is also possible that they did not decide on a new King as the successor of King Ar-Pharazôn, because they did not know if Ar-Pharazôn had survived the invasion of Aman and had achieved his desire of immortality there or had died in Aman or in the Drowning of Númenor.

It is not known, if Herumor and Fuinur, who rose to power among the Haradrim in the wide lands south of Mordor,

## Etymology
The origin of the name *Umbar* was forgotten. Umbar already received its name before the ships of the Númenóreans sailed the sea. As a consequence, it is a name in one of the pre-Númenórean languages. Despite the coincidental similarity, the name Umbar is not related to the Quenya word *umbar*, which means fate.

## Other versions of the legendarium

The label "Havens of Umbar" is written below a bay that lies south of South Gondor near the bottom edge of the General Map of Middle-earth that was included in earlier editions of *The Lord of the Rings*. The City of the Corsairs lies at the easternmost point of the bay of Umbar on this map.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2023: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:The City of the Corsairs is known properly as "Umbar Baharbêl", and the realm also encompasses the Cape of Umbar and the few settlements upon it. Offshore from the cape is the shipwreck-strewn archipelago called "Zirâr Tarka, the Shield Isles" of Umbar, home to castaways, exiles, and freebooters. The Umbari language is partially inspired by Maltese.
:After the defeat at Pelargir and the downfall of Sauron, the Umbari people rebel against those those loyal to Sauron and the Haradrim "Empire of Ordâkh" occupying the city. Now a Free City, Umbar is ruled by a council of seven called the "Kindred of the Coins". At least some of the Kindred have designs against Gondor, and so the players must investigate on behalf of King Elessar and Queen Arwen, while befriending and assisting the citizens.
