# Grey Havens

The **Grey Havens**, also known as **Mithlond**, were seaports on both sides of the end of the Gulf of Lune near the mouth of the River Lhûn in western Eriador.

## History
### Second Age
Founded by the Elves of Lindon in , the Grey Havens were known for their good harbourage and many ships; these were used by any of the Eldar to leave Middle-earth for Eressëa or Valinor. Círdan was Lord of the Havens from its foundation and into the Fourth Age.

In , *Entulessë*, a Númenórean ship headed by Captain Vëantur, arrived in Mithlond and it was there that the Númenóreans first landed in Middle-earth.

In the War of the Elves and Sauron, the Lhûn was held in desperate defence of the Havens after Sauron had conquered almost all of Eriador. The beleaguered defenders were saved with the arrival of Tar-Minastir's fleet and Sauron's forces were driven back.

### Third Age
After the fall of Gil-galad (during the time of the Kings of Arnor), the Grey Havens was still home to the largest population of Noldor in Middle-earth, aside from Rivendell in Eriador. Cirdan remained the Lord of the Havens and ruled the Elves of Lindon from Mithlond. 

About , the Istari or Wizards arrived in Middle-earth at the Grey Havens. Círdan, upon meeting Gandalf, gave him Narya, the Ring of Fire.

In , Prince Eärnur of Gondor brought a fleet of Gondorians to the Grey Havens to aid Arthedain against Angmar. The fleet was so massive that the ships of Gondor filled the Grey Havens, as well as Forlond and Harlond.

In ,

### Later history

Following the defeat of Sauron and the crowning of King Aragorn Elessar in the War of the Ring, the last of the Noldor set sail from the Grey Havens and left Middle-earth for Valinor. Years later, Fairbairn family tradition held that Samwise Gamgee in  also sailed West from the Grey Havens. but it was recognized that eventually, its purpose would reach an end when no more Elves wished to cross the Sea. At that time, Círdan would abandon the Grey Havens and finally travel the Straight Road himself. At some unknown date, Celeborn eventually sought the Grey Havens and with Círdan, they took the Last Ship together.

## Etymology

- Mithlond* is Sindarin for "Grey Havens", from *mith* ("grey") + *lond* ("harbour").
