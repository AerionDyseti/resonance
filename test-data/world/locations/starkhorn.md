# Starkhorn

The **Starkhorn** was a large jagged snow-clad peak that rose in the inner regions of the White Mountains of Middle-earth.

## History

It could be seen quite clearly from the southern end of the refuge of Dunharrow in Rohan. From its feet sprang the Snowbourn River, whose widening valley ran northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of Rohan. The Rohirrim called that valley Harrowdale, and built their courts of Edoras at its mouth, from where the lonely white peak of the Starkhorn could be seen along the straight length of the valley.
