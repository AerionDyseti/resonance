# Eregion

__NOTOC__

**Eregion**, later known as **Hollin**, was a realm of the Ñoldorin Elves in the Second Age, located near the West-gate of Khazad-dûm (later Moria). It was a rare Elven kingdom, as its relations with Dwarves were cordial, and both sides traded freely with each other.

## History

### Second Age
Eregion was, from SA 750, ruled by Galadriel and Celeborn from its capital of Ost-in-Edhil. After SA 1350, they crossed the Misty Mountains to Lothlórien, their new kingdom.

From SA 1350, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain under Celebrimbor, the last of the House of Fëanor left in Middle-earth, ruled Eregion. Annatar, the Giver of Gifts, befriended Celebrimbor and aided him in the making of the Nine and Seven Rings of Power. Celebrimbor made the Three in secret, and as such these were never touched by Annatar's hands.

When Annatar was later revealed to be the Dark Lord Sauron, Celebrimbor and his people tried to stop the Rings from entering Sauron's possession, but could only rescue the Three: Vilya, Narya, and Nenya. Eregion itself was attacked and destroyed in the War of the Elves and Sauron in the year SA 1697. The few survivors of the war found refuge in either Lindon or Lothlórien, while others led by Elrond founded Rivendell.

## Etymology
In Sindarin, ***Eregion*** means "Land of the Holly", from the word *ereg* ("holly"). Men simply called it *Hollin*.

Eregion should not be pronounced as in English *region*: the *g* is the *g* in "get". The pronunciation is , or, simplified, [air-egg-eon].

## In adaptations
### *The Rings of Power*
Eregion, mainly Ost-in-Edhil, is portrayed in Amazon Studios' series  as a developed Elven city built near the west gate of Khazad-dûm, as the home of Celebrimbor, Lord of Eregion, and his smiths.
