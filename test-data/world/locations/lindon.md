# Lindon

**Lindon** was a region of western Middle-earth. Initially populated by Laiquendi, in the following Ages it became an important Elven realm, known for its harbors and ships that would embark unto the Uttermost West.

## Geography
Lindon was the name of the remnant of Ossiriand, a region west of the Blue Mountains, in East Beleriand. After the deluge of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, Lindon became the westernmost land of the continent of Middle-earth. The Gulf of Lune broke into Lindon and the Blue Mountains and divided the realm into *Forlindon* (North Lindon) and *Harlindon* (South Lindon). The eastern border of Lindon was the River Lune, beyond which was Arnor.

## History
### First Age
The name *Lindon* was first used by the exiled Ñoldor for the region of Ossiriand.

Lindon was the only part of Beleriand that survived the War of Wrath, the rest of the continent having been broken or submerged by the tumults. However, the Sea broke through the Blue Mountains, creating the Gulf of Lhûn.

Many of the surviving Elves of drowned Beleriand, especially the exiled Ñoldor, relocated to Lindon by the beginning of the Second Age, where Gil-galad ruled.

### Kingdom of Gil-galad
Gil-galad founded the **Kingdom of Lindon** in SA 1, ruling over the Ñoldor, Sindar, and all Elves of Lindon alike. At this time the Havens, Mithlond, and also likely Harlond and Forlond were built, from which many Elves left for Valinor in subsequent years.

The Ñoldor mainly dwelt in Forlindon, and the Sindar with remaining Green-elves lived in Harlindon (a fief under the rule of Celeborn). Presumably, the surviving Edain also stayed for some time alongside the Elves of Lindon, until they left for Elenna in SA 32. But there was some tension between the Elves; some of the Sindar did not wish to live under Gil-galad alongside the Ñoldor, and went to dwell among the Silvan Elves in the east, who were their Telerin kin Some Ñoldor also left to found Eregion in SA 700, the second of the two Ñoldorin realms.thumb|357x357px|Lindon in the Second Age.

In SA 600, Entulessë, a ship from Númenor arrived in Mithlond where Gil-galad welcomed the Númenóreans, who went on to re-establish contact with their distant kin, the Middle Men.

During the War of the Elves and Sauron, Sauron overran Eriador. The Elves called that time Days of Flight as many fled to Lindon where Sauron could not enter, and thence over the Sea to the Uttermost West. Eventually Tar-Minastir sent ships to Lindon, responding to Gil-galad's plea. The combined army of Elves and Númenóreans drove Sauron's forces out of Eriador.

In the tumult following the Downfall of Númenor, Lindon suffered great loss as "*the sea rode in upon the land*", and therefore had shrunk when the Third Age began.
### Rule of Círdan
After the War of the Last Alliance, most of the Ñoldor and many Sindar departed for Valinor, and Lindon became depopulated, now ruled by Gil-galad's lieutenant, the Telerin Elf Círdan the Shipwright, who kept building ships for the departing Elves.

During the days of the Kings, most of the High Elves that still lingered in Middle-earth were found in Lindon. Beyond the Lune was Elvish country, green and quiet, where no Men went; but Dwarves dwelt in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially south of the Gulf of Lune, where they had mines in use. ("to sing, make musical sound") and *-on*, which is a common suffix for regions.

## In adaptations
### *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*
Lindon is the Elven region ruled by Gil-galad from its capital, the Grey Havens, in the Second Age, and is considered the Capital of the High Elves. First glimpsed in , "", it is here that Elrond meets Galadriel after returning from her hunt for remnants of Sauron's forces in Middle-earth. This Grey Havens are portrayed as being split into a harbor area and a forested area on a bluff above the harbor where most of the activity happens in the series.
