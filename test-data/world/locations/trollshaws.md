# Trollshaws

## History

During the great days of Arnor, the eastern sub-kingdom of Rhudaur built fortified dwellings and castles here, but largely because of the wars with Angmar, the area became deserted of men and dangerous to travel through. By the late Third Age, they were infamous for being the haunting place of trolls, mainly Hill-trolls that had travelled down from the Ettenmoors. Three of these trolls were famously renowned for waylaying Bilbo Baggins and his company of Dwarves, as they set out for the Lonely Mountain. These particular trolls, Tom, Bert, and William, were turned to stone on a ridge at the coming of dawn and were encountered many years later by Frodo Baggins and company on their way to Rivendell.
