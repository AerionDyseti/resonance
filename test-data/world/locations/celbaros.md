# Celbaros

**Celbaros** was a town in Tol Eressëa, according to the early version of the legendarium associated with *The Book of Lost Tales*.

## Etymology
The name *Celbaros* is in Gnomish. While the meaning of the name isn't entirely clear, the second element seems to be *baros* ("hamlet").

## Inspiration
Celbaros only appears in one of the drawings of the three early heraldic devices made by Tolkien (the other two depict Cortirion and Tavrobel), however, unlike the others, Celbaros was never incorporated into the mythology.

It is likely that Celbaros was identified with the English town of Cheltenham, where J.R.R. Tolkien and Edith Bratt were reunited on January 8, 1913 - and after a separation of three years, Tolkien asked Edith to marry him.
