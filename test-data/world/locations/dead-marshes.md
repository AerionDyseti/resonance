# Dead Marshes

The **Dead Marshes**, also known as the **Mere of Dead Faces**, was a wide area of dark stagnant marshes east of the Emyn Muil and bordered on the east by the Dagorlad plain, site of the ancient Battle of Dagorlad during the War of the Last Alliance.

## History

The marshes predated the Battle of Dagorlad, but were not named until after the Battle of Dagorlad in the year 3434 of the late Second Age when the Last Alliance of Elves and Men fought the forces of Mordor. In the battle, many of the Galadhrim under Malgalad fled into the marshes where they were slain. These Elves were later buried near the marshes, but over a long period of time, the graves were swallowed up as the marshes grew bigger. The water preserved the bodies and they remained visibly floating as dead faces which became Corpse-candles (Quenya: *loikolíkuma*) sometime after. When the general Eärnil II came north and defeated the Wainriders in the Battle of the Camp, he drove their remnant into the Dead Marshes where most of them perished.

On February 1 of the year 3017, Aragorn II entered the outskirts of the marshes, discovering and capturing Gollum there before taking him to Mirkwood where he handed him over to Thranduil

### The War of the Ring

During the quest to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom, Gollum led Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee through the marshes. They entered the Dead Marshes at dawn on March 1 of the year 3019. The passage was marked by lights and candles that danced about which Gollum called "candles of corpses"; it is likely that those who became entranced by the lights and attempted to touch the bodies drowned in the water and went down to join the dead. Frodo soon became entranced by these lights and attempted to reach out to feel the Dead Faces. Though Sam broke him out of his trance, Frodo was able to catch a small glimpse of the history of the more fair Dead Faces. Gollum then told them that the dead could not be touched, suggesting that he once attempted to do so in the past. While passing through the marshes, a Nazgûl on a Black Wing passed overhead, terrifying Gollum enough that he started to slip into old speech-habits, which he had almost given up after swearing to serve the one who hold the ring. They exited the Marshes on the morning of March 2,

Tom Shippey elucidates on the resemblance of the Dead Marshes to a World War I battlefield in the 1996 documentary, *A Film Portrait of J.R.R. Tolkien*.

## In adaptations
### In *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*

In the  of Peter Jackson's  in 2002, the Dead Marshes are shown as foggy ponds with jets of fire rather than the misty candle-flames described in the book. Frodo actually falls into one of the ponds, in which ghostly figures appear, and surround and reach for him, before Gollum pulls him out.

### In *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*

In the  of  , Elanor Brandyfoot's family is shown to pass through the marshes as part of their migration east. The location is here known as the **Grey Marshes** since the events of Season One take place before the Battle of Dagorlad.
