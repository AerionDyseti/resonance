# Ost-in-Edhil

**Ost-in-Edhil** ( – , existed for c. 947 years) was the chief city in the elven realm of Eregion It was the only road of old from the west to Khazad-dûm and ran along the river Sirannon. Ost-in-Edhil was not within sight of the road for many miles from Moria. As a consequence, it is possible that Ost-in-Edhil was located near the river Sirannon many miles downstream from its source at the west gate of Moria.

## History
Around  Galadriel and her husband Celeborn, who were regarded as the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador founded the elven realm of Eregion. The Elves of Eregion were primarily Noldor. Celebrimbor, a Noldorin smith who had accompanied Galadriel and Celeborn, and other elven smiths founded the Gwaith-i-Mírdain, a brotherhood of Elven craftsmen. a highroad that connected the city with the west gate of Khazad-dûm. Around  Annatar, who was in truth Sauron forged a master ring in Mordor with the fire of Mount Doom to dominate the wearers of the Rings of Power. When Sauron put the master ring on his finger Celebrimbor and the other Elves became aware of his plan to be the master of the wearers of the Rings of Power and took their rings off Sauron and his army were eventually defeated by the Elves with help from the Númenóreans in  and Sauron fled back to Mordor. It means "Fortress of the Eldar". Paul Strack suggests that the name is a combination of *ost* ("fortress", "fort", "stronghold", "citadel", "fortified town", "enclosure"), the plural *in* of the definite article *i* and the plural *Edhil* of *edhel* "Elf".

:As the game does not have the rights to the name "Ost-in-Edhil", other names are used for Eregion's capital. "Mirobel, the Jewel-town" is applied to the eastern part of the city, in the game's region of Eregion proper. It includes "Tham Mírdain": the jewelsmiths' school and library, as well as the Ring-forges. The larger, western part of the city, "Caras Gelebren, the Silver Bastion", lies within the Swanfleet region.

:In addition to exploring the late Third Age ruins, players can experience a flashback scenario in which they defend Caras Gelebren during its fall.
