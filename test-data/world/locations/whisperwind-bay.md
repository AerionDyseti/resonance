Nestled along the enigmatic shores of Azrai lies Whisperwind Bay, a remarkable sanctuary where the realm's notorious eldritch weather patterns mysteriously dissipate. This sheltered cove serves as a natural haven, its waters unusually calm compared to the turbulent seas beyond its boundaries.

The bay's unique properties stem from an ancient ring of ward-stones that encircle its perimeter. These megalithic structures, weathered by centuries of exposure yet still humming with archaic power, create an invisible dome of protection over the waters and surrounding coastline. Deep within the twisting sea caves that riddle the bay's cliff faces lies the Binding Circle, an ancient chamber where a fallen angel was bound during the cataclysmic opening of the Black Spire's rift to the Fade. Sailors and travelers often speak of the striking contrast between the roiling storms outside the bay and the perpetual serenity within.

Local fisherfolk have made Whisperwind Bay their home, taking advantage of its protected waters to maintain a stable livelihood despite Azrai's otherwise challenging environment. The ward-stones have become not just protective talismans but also important cultural landmarks, with many traditions and stories woven around their mysterious origins.

- Protected Waters: Calm seas within the bay's boundaries, regardless of external weather conditions
