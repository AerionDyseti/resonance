# Maglor's Gap

'''Maglor's Gap'* was a lowland region of the Elves in Middle-earth. It was located between the hills surrounding Himring, the extension of the Blue Mountains just north of Mount Rerir, and the two arms of the Gelion river. It was the widest break in the northern mountain-fences of Beleriand. The region was the ward of Maglor, second of the Sons of Fëanor. 

The Gap had a combination of scrub-lands, thickets, and light forest areas. It was also somewhat cold at times, being close to the northern realm of Morgoth. Due to its open terrain and lack of hills, it was a natural route for attacks by Morgoth's Orcs, who could then pass from the north into the lands of Fëanor's people. In response, Maglor kept many riders to guard the Gap, serving as the main cavalry force of the Ñoldor. In addition, Caranthir fortified the mountains to the east (establishing his base upon Rerir's slopes and beside Lake Helevorn) while Maedhros constructed his stronghold atop the Hill of Himring to the west.  

## History

In the early First Age, horsemen led by Maglor guarded Maglor's Gap against the forces of Morgoth. During the Dagor Bragollach, they were defeated; Maglor fled to Himring, along with most of the survivors of the battle. After the War of Wrath, Maglor's Gap was destroyed and lost under the waves along with the rest of Beleriand.
