# Rivendell

**Rivendell**, or **Imladris**, was an Elven outpost in the Misty Mountains on the eastern edge of Eriador. Due to its location, it was called the **Last Homely House** from the point of view of a traveller going to the Misty Mountains and Wilderland; and also the **First Homely House** from the point of view of someone coming from these lands to the civilised lands of Eriador to the west.

It was established by Elrond in  as a refuge from Sauron after the Fall of Eregion. It remained Elrond's seat throughout the remainder of the Second Age and until the end of the Third Age, when he took the White Ship for Valinor. Rivendell had a strong alliance with the Kings of Arnor and after the fall of Arthedain, it became a refuge for the Rangers of the North and the Heir of Isildur.

## Geography

Rivendell was located at the edge of a narrow gorge of the Bruinen River, but well hidden in the moorlands and foothills of the Misty Mountains.

Pine-trees grew on the top of the valley, and there was a "steep zig-zag path" to the valley bottom. The vegetation in the valley bottom was mostly oak and beech.

#### Last Alliance
At the end of the Second Age, Elendil and Gil-galad formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to challenge Sauron, and their host halted for a while at Imladris in  and they stayed there for 3 years, gathered their forces before crossing the Misty Mountains. After receiving the shards of Narsil, Valandil took up his role as King of Arnor and left Imladris for Annúminas.

### Third Age
After the fall of Gil-galad, Elrond remained in Imladris. During the Third Age, it was a refuge and sanctuary; many Elves gathered there, and it was the chief dwelling of the High Elves in Eriador, except the Elves of Lindon, but also wise and powerful people of all the races. Most of the Elves who lived in Rivendell were High Elves. The Heirs of Isildur were also harboured there due to their kinship with Elrond, as descendants of his brother Elros.

After the end of the North-kingdom in  Aranarth, the first Chieftain of the Dúnedain, had his son fostered in Rivendell, as were all subsequent sons of the chieftains. The heirlooms and treasures of the house of Isildur, including the shards of Narsil, were also kept there after Arvedui's death.

There was traffic across the Misty Mountains in the Third Age between Imladris and Lothlórien, for Elrond's wife was Celebrían, daughter of Galadriel and Celeborn.

In the Quest of Erebor, Bilbo Baggins stopped off at Rivendell with the Dwarves on the way to the Lonely Mountain Bilbo retired there after his 111th birthday, writing his memoir *There and Back Again*.

Years later, Frodo Baggins and his companions journeyed to Rivendell, where they met Bilbo. Several other Elves, Dwarves and Men had also arrived at Rivendell on separate errands;

Following the destruction of the One Ring at the end of the Third Age, Elrond's ring lost its power, and Elrond, with many of his household, left Rivendell to sail for Valinor from the Grey Havens; this marked the start of the Fourth Age. 

### Later history
Although Elrond departed from Rivendell, Elladan and Elrohir remained for a while with some of the remaining Noldor. It is believed that Celeborn also relocated to Rivendell after the departure of Galadriel and having also grown weary of East Lórien.

It is not known when Rivendell was finally abandoned, but shortly before Aragorn died in , he said to Arwen that "none now walk" in the garden of Elrond, indicating that the last of the Noldor had departed to Valinor. The name *Imladris* is also glossed as "flat-floored valley of the Cleft" but also simply as "Canyon of the Cleft".

The original Common Speech name of *Rivendell* was ***Karningul*** (itself a translation of *Imladris*).

## Other names
The Quenya name ***Arcimbelë*** is used only once in a manuscript, and its meaning is unclear except for the element *imbë* ("deep vale"). A more literal translation is given: *Latimberista*, from *latimbë* ("glen") + *rista* ("cut"). However, on the same page, Tolkien stated that this name was not used in practice, and was replaced the Quenyarized form of *Imladris*: ***Imbeláris***. This name was retained from the earlier Cottage of the Lost Play found in the Book of Lost Tales.

## Inspiration
A possible inspiration (so suggested by David Salo) could have been Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland, which Tolkien visited in 1911:
