# Minas Morgul

**Minas Morgul** (originally called **Minas Ithil**) was the twin city of Minas Tirith before its fall to the forces of Sauron in the Third Age. It was situated some way within the narrow Morgul Valley, guarding the pass between Ithilien and Mordor.

## Description
300px|thumb|*Minas Morgul* by Matthew BurtonIn its prime, Minas Ithil was a beautiful place. It sat high on a rocky seat "upon the black knees" of the Ephel Dúath, overlooking the valley. Moonlight reflected off the marble walls of the city so that it seemed to shine. The tall tower of the city had many windows, and the topmost part rotated slowly from one side to the other. A white bridge crossed the nearby river, with large meadows on both banks of the stream.  

After being taken by the forces of evil, the city became terrible, and the valley was filled with decay. The city was lit by a pale white light, and the gate was shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth and eyes. The meadows were filled with deadly white flowers emitting a sickly odour. At the head of the bridge crossing the Morgulduin were corrupted human and bestial statues. The river steamed a poisonous, deadly cold vapour, and the water was undrinkable.

The city was accessed by the Morgul-road, which ran from Osgiliath to the crossroads and along the north side of the Morgulduin until across from the city, where it crossed the valley on a white bridge before wounding up to the city gate in the northern wall.

## History
### Second Age
After the destruction of Númenor, Isildur and Anárion, the sons of Elendil, landed in Gondor. Isildur built Minas Ithil near the mountainous border of Mordor from where he would rule the fief of Ithilien; while Anárion built Minas Anor to rule over the fief of Anórien. Minas Ithil housed the Ithil-stone, a *palantír.*

When Sauron returned after escaping Númenor's destruction, he attacked the exiles of Númenor, and his forces took Minas Ithil by storm. When the Last Alliance of Elves and Men defeated Sauron in the year , Minas Ithil was restored as a watchtower.

### Third Age
After the defeat of the Witch-king of Angmar in the north, he returned to Mordor in , summoning the other Nazgûl with him to prepare the return of their master. A few years later () they laid siege to Minas Ithil and two years later they managed to take the city. The Ithil-stone was also captured and later used by Sauron to influence Saruman and Denethor II.

Minas Ithil was occupied by fell creatures, and it changed into a foul, evil place.  As a result, it came to be called Minas Morgul, which in the tongue of Gondor means "Tower of Dark Sorcery". Many Gondorians fled from Ithilien.

During the Watchful Peace, the lords of Morgul had secretly bred the Uruk-hai, and in  these creatures assailed and overran Ithilien.

### War of the Ring
During the War of the Ring, a host from Minas Morgul set forth toward Minas Tirith. The host was witnessed by Frodo, Sam and Gollum. After some opposition in Osgiliath, the Morgul-host proceeded to the Pelennor Fields and laid siege to Minas Tirith. However the host, including the city's garrison was devastated during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

Following the battle, the Army of the West pulled down the bridge leading to Morgul Vale and set its fields aflame. They met no opposition as the entire city's garrison had been killed at the Battle.  

After the War of the Ring, Faramir was made Prince of Ithilien by King Elessar, who advised him to make his abode in the Emyn Arnen south-east of Minas Tirith for "Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years". It is not known if the city was ever rebuilt.
## Etymology
**Minas Morgul** is a Sindarin name. It means "Tower of Sorcery". It is a compound of *minas* ("tower") and *morgul* ("black sorcery"), *Morgul* is a compound of *mor(n)* ("black") and *gul* ("sorcery, black arts").

**Minas Ithil** is another Sindarin name. It means "Tower of the Moon" or "Tower of the Rising Moon".
## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier drafts, Minas Morgul was called Minas Morghul, and guarded Cirith Ungol (then called Kirith Ungol) instead of the Tower of Cirith Ungol.
