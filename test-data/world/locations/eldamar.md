# Eldamar

__NOTOC__
**Eldamar**, once called by the Hobbits **the Faerie**, was the region of Aman where the Elves lived in ancient times before the Changing of the World.

## Description
The size of Eldamar is unknown, but the area between the Bay of Eldamar and the Pelóri was probably at least a few dozen miles wide; Eldamar also consisted of the shore of Taniquetil and the Calacirya where Tirion was built. The shore probably extended hundreds of miles to the north of the Calacirya. 

The city of the Ñoldor (and for a time the Vanyar also) was Tirion, which was built on the hill of Túna facing both the Two Trees and the starlit seas.

The city of the Teleri, on the north shore of the Bay was Alqualondë, or Haven of the Swans, whose halls and mansions were made of pearl. The harbor was entered through a natural arch of rock, and the beaches were strewn with gems given by the Ñoldor.

In the bay was Tol Eressëa the Lonely Isle, which was an island at one time adrift, until Ulmo rooted it in the bay.

South of Eldamar was Avathar, once the home of Ungoliant, a vast creature in the shape of a spider.

== Etymology == 
***Eldamar*** is a Quenya word that meant 'Elvenhome'. In Old English the 'Elvenhome' was called ***Ælfhâm***.
