# Elvenking's Halls

The '''Elvenking's Halls''' were a cave system in northern Mirkwood, in which King Thranduil and many of the Elves of Mirkwood lived during most of the Third Age and into the Fourth Age.

## Description
The halls were just inside the eastern border of Mirkwood on the north bank of the Forest River, some miles upstream from Esgaroth.

The entryway to the halls had huge stone doors

## History
About  the Shadow began to fall upon Greenwood (causing it to be called Mirkwood). In response, King Thranduil led his people to the north-east corner of the forest and delved there a fortress and series of great halls underground. He was inspired in this enterprise by Thingol's halls of Menegroth in Doriath during the First Age. Like Thingol, Thranduil enlisted the aid of the Dwarves in making his stronghold, though the Elvenking's Halls of Mirkwood were less grand than that magnificent ancient cavern.

In the autumn of  About 20 June , Orcs attacked and Gollum disappeared. Nothing more is said of these halls.
