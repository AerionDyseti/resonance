## Overview

Hidden grotto beneath the Desert Oasis, reachable by rope tied to a surface tree root. The air is cool and damp. A ring of faintly glowing, likely poisonous flowers surrounds a clear pool.

## Notable Features

- Shattered bell near the body of Vek-Khar (the Anointer)
- Draconic prayer cloth to the Great Dragon Spirits (Io), unaffected by shadow decay
- Exit passage transitions from natural stone to ancient, angled brickwork of the Giant Kingdoms
- Soot‑stained broken‑triangle sigil that, when touched, set heavy mechanisms in motion deeper within

## Hooks

- Shadow corruption evidence on supplies, but three vials of water remained unspoiled
- Path leads toward deeper ruin chambers where an Echo of the Wight was encountered at initiative start
