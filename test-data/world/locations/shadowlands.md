Location Description: The Shadowlands is a plane within Soelle (The First World), reflecting darker aspects of creation, characterized by shadow, entropy, reflection, and primordial chaos. It exists in balance with the Feywild, where the Feywild represents chaotic creation and the Shadowlands embodies quiet dissolution. Both planes operate on emotion and instinct, forming an eternal cycle of creation and reclamation, with a connection to Xenirith, who once governed the natural cycle of entropy.

The Shadowlands is the second major world within **Soelle** (The First World), representing the darker, more entropic aspects of the First Draft of creation. This plane serves as a shadowy reflection of the vibrant Feywild.

## Nature of the Shadowlands

As the counterpart to the Feywild within the First World, the Shadowlands embodies:

- **Shadow and darkness** - not evil, but the absence of the Feywild's vibrant life
- **Entropy and decay** - the natural cycle of endings that balance creation
- **Reflection and memory** - echoes of what was and what might have been
- **Primordial reclamation** - representing the original chaos before structured reality

## Relationship to the Feywild

The Shadowlands and Feywild exist in balance within Soelle:

- Where the Feywild represents explosive, chaotic creation, the Shadowlands represent quiet dissolution
- Both planes operate on emotion and instinct rather than the structured laws of Enym
- Together they form the complete "First Draft" - creation and reclamation in eternal cycle

## Connection to Xenirith

The Shadowlands may have particular resonance with **Xenirith**, the destroyed member of the Trinity who represented Reclamation, as this plane embodies the natural cycle of entropy that Xenirith once governed.
