# Caras Galadhon

**Caras Galadhon** was the city and fortress of the Galadhrim of Lothlórien.

## Overview
Caras Galadhon was in the Naith of Lothlórien, in the angle between the rivers Celebrant and Anduin known as Egladil.

## History
The city was founded in the second millennium of the Third Age due to the growing threat of Dol Guldur.

## Etymology
The name *Caras Galadhon* is said to be Silvan Elvish.. Tolkien mentions the proper meaning of this word was "a built fort or dwelling surrounded by bulwarks", deriving from the root √CAR "make, build", or a "circular earthwall with dike". The city would be named ***Caras (i)Ngelelaið*** In pure Sindarin form.

- Galadhon* can be interpreted as genitive plural "of trees", showing a case ending not existing in Sindarin but known from Quenya. Tolkien's earliest version of Sindarin, called Goldogrin, also possessed this ending. In that case, Caras Galadhon means "moated fortress of the trees".

The name could also refer in some way to Galadhon, whom Tolkien conceived to be the father of Celeborn. In that case, the name would mean *"Galadhon's fortress".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first edition of *The Fellowship of the Ring*, Caras Galadhon was misspelled ***Caras Galadon***.

'*2001: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring''
:A view of Caras Galadhon from Cerin Amroth is only present in the Extended Edition. The Fellowship's stay in the city is a significant portion of the film.

'*2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):**
:Caras Galadhon scenes are rather brief, mostly limited to the Mirror of Galadriel scene.

**2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Caras Galadhon is the main inhabited area in Lothlórien, where players cannot enter until they prove their friendship to Galadhrim. The map and general layout of the city is replicated from the map in *The Atlas of Middle-earth*. The city hosts most major gameplay facilities and is composed of a large number of flets on different levels, connected by multiple ladders and staircases. It is rather hard to navigate and thus several quests consist solely of directing the player to various point of interest, then challenging him to find them again. The Company Pavilion, Galadriel's Garden and the House of Celeborn are also located there.
