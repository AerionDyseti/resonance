# Dor-Cúarthol

**Dor-Cúarthol**, the **Land of Bow and Helm**, was an area where a resistance was mounted against the forces of Morgoth in Beleriand during the later part of the First Age.

## History

The region was established when Beleg agreed to join his good friend Túrin in opposition to the Orcs infesting the area. This resulted in an alliance protecting land between the River Taeglin and Talath Dirnen, when Túrin went by the name *Gorthol*. For almost a year, this alliance held off the Orcs of Morgoth until the treachery of Mîm the Petty-dwarf brought it to a bloody end: the outlaw stronghold at Amon Rûdh was discovered and compromised, and Orcs overcame and slew the outlaws. Túrin and Beleg abandoned the area.

## Etymology

***Dor-Cúarthol*** was Sindarin for 'Land of Bow and Helm'. The helm referred to was the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, which Túrin bore at the time; and the reference to a bow was likely due to the bow that Beleg bore.
