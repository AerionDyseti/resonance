# Morthond

The **Morthond**, also known as the **Blackroot**, was one of the rivers of Gondor, located in the province of Lamedon near the Stone of Erech.

According to the *The Atlas of Middle-earth*, it was about one-hundred fifty miles in length from north to south. Its source was a spring in Mornan, a small valley located directly beneath the Dwimorberg in the White Mountains.
