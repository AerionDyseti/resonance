# Northerland

The **Northerland**, the **Norland**, the **Northern Lands**, the **Northlands**, the **Northern world**, and the **North**, were vague terms for various lands of Middle-earth.

The regions of Anfauglith, the Ered Engrin, and Hithlum (Dor-lómin and Mithrim) were all described as belonging to the Northlands. During the late Third Age, Boromir referred to the regions north of the Tharbad as Northerland. The Bree-land in Eriador were considered to be Northern Lands. While at Rivendell, Bilbo Baggins poetically described the sunken Beleriand as Norland, a shortened form of Northerland, in his poem about Eärendil. During the Council of Elrond, Gimli described Khazad-dûm as being the greatest realm of the Northern world.
