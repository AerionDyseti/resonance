# Avallónë

**Avallónë** was a city and seaport on the eastern shore of the island of Tol Eressëa. Its name indicated that it was the city nearest to Valinor and the tower of Avallónë was the first sight that a mariner beheld as he approached the Undying Lands. The city was described as white-shining with a great harbour with lamplit quays. It had a tower where the Master-stone abode. 

## History
After the War of Wrath and the downfall of Morgoth the Valar summoned the Eldar to return to the West. Not all obeyed this new summons but those who did dwelt on Tol Eressëa.

In the Second Age some of the Men of Númenor, those most far-sighted, could see Avallónë from the summit of the Meneltarma or from a tall ship that lay off the western coast as far as was lawful to go. Some thought this far off vision was of Valinor itself but the wise knew it was but Avallónë. While the Númenóreans respected the Ban of the Valar many elves would sail to Númenor; they brought birds, flower, and herbs to the land.

The sight of Avallónë beyond their reach helped to kindle resentment in the hearts of the Númenóreans against the Ban. As the people of the island turned against the Valar the visits of the Eldar became few and only made in secret to the Faithful. By the reign of Tar-Palantir the city of Avallónë was veiled in cloud.

## Etymology
- Avallónë* seems to be a compound of *ava* ("outer") and *lónë* ("island"), as in *The Etymologies* the Middle-Quenya *Avalóna* is given that meaning.

## Other versions of the legendarium
The name *Avalon* is given for first time to Tol Eressea in the second version of The Fall of Númenor, and it was so named "for it is hard by Valinor", so perhaps it included an abbreviation of *Valinor*. In later texts a main city of Tol Eressëa is named *Avallon(de)* ("Haven of the Gods"), probably containing the elements *Vala* (or their Adûnaic name *Avalô*). However, the texts used by Christopher for his *Silmarillion* were those that corrected Avallónë as a city of the Isle.

## Inspiration
In a letter to Milton Waldman, Tolkien states that Frodo and Bilbo were given an "Arthurian ending". It has been suggested by Hammond and Scull that Tolkien was emphasising this connection in the name Avallónë, echoing the island of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon Avalon] that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Arthur King Arthur] goes to in order to recover from his wounds.
