# Himlad

**Himlad** was a cold land in East Beleriand during the First Age. It lay between the rivers Aros and Celon in the northwest of Beleriand.

## History

Himlad was held by Celegorm and Curufin before the Siege of Angband. When Aredhel was lost, she passed through Himlad until she found Nan Elmoth. Years later, when Aredhel and her son Maeglin left Nan Elmoth to return to Gondolin, Eöl the Dark Elf crossed Himlad and was captured by the riders of Curufin.

This land was held by Celegorm and Curufin until the Dagor Bragollach in the latter part of the First Age.

## Etymology

***Himlad*** means "cool plain", from the Sindarin *him* ("cool") and *lad* ("plain").
