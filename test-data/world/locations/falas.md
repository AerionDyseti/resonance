# Falas

The **Falas** was an area on the coast of West Beleriand, south of Nevrast.

## History

The River Brithon and the River Nenning ran into the sea here. The Sindarin Elves ruled by Círdan dwelt here, and built the havens of Brithombar and Eglarest. In FA 65, Finrod built the tower of Barad Nimras on a cape of the Falas between Brithombar and Eglarest, to watch for attacks from the sea by Morgoth.

The Falas only occasionally entered into the events of the First Age; in the First Battle of Beleriand, Morgoth's host overran the Falas and besieged the two havens, but lifted the siege in order to join in the Second Battle. The Havens of the Falas were finally destroyed in FA 473, and Círdan's people fled to the Mouths of Sirion and the Isle of Balar.

## Etymology

***Falas*** was a Sindarin word that meant 'coast'.
