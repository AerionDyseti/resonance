# Beleriand

**Beleriand** was a vast region in northwestern Middle-earth during the First Age. Originally, its name referred only to the area around the Bay of Balar, but in time the name applied to the entire land. The root of its name, *Beler *or *Balar,* is believed to refer to the Maia Ossë, who often dwelt at the shores of Balar. The War of Wrath at the end of the First Age brought the destruction of the entire continent (except Lindon and several island realms), and its descent into the Sea.

## Geography
To the west and south, Beleriand had a long coast with the Great Sea Belegaer; to the north were the highlands of Hithlum, Dorthonion, and Hill of Himring; to the east the Blue Mountains reached nearly to the Sea. The land of Nevrast in the northwest was sometimes considered part of Beleriand.

Sirion, the chief river of Beleriand running north to south, divided the region into West Beleriand and East Beleriand. Crossing it east to west was a series of hills and a sudden drop in elevation known as Andram, the Long Wall. (The river sank into the ground at the Fens of Sirion, and re-emerged below the Andram at the Gates of Sirion.) To the east of the Long Wall, was the River Gelion with its six tributaries flowing from the Blue Mountains, in an area known as Ossiriand or the Land of Seven Rivers. The River Brithon and the River Nenning were the two lesser rivers of the western land of Falas.

In the year FA 587, Beleriand was mostly destroyed by the War of Wrath of the Valar against Morgoth. Only a small section of Ossiriand remained, and was known as Lindon. In addition, fulfilling a prophecy, the graves of Túrin Turambar and Morwen also survived as the island Tol Morwen. Part of Dorthonion became Tol Fuin, and the Hill of Himring became Tol Himling. All of these together were known as the Western Isles.

The final words of Galadriel to Treebeard at their parting at Isengard, "Not in Middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of Tasarinan we may meet in the spring. Farewell!" suggests that Beleriand will be recovered from the Sea again in Arda Envinyanta after the Dagor Dagorath, since it will be a new Arda Unmarred, but containing all the good things of Arda Hastaina. After this, Beleriand will likely be home to Ents, Elves, Men, Dwarves, and Eagles once more.

## Etymology
The name ***Beleriand*** refers either to the continent's initial colonization by the Teleri, who had been ferried there upon the Isle of Balar, or to the land's great Bay of Balar, in accordance with the name's meaning in Sindarin, "land of Balar".

Beleriand had many emended different names in Tolkien's earlier writings (see: ): **Broceliand**, **Broseliand**, **Golodhinand**, **Noldórinan**, **Geleriand**, **Bladorinand**, **Belaurien**, **Arsiriand**, **Lassiriand**, and **Ossiriand** (which was later used as a name for a region of Beleriand).
