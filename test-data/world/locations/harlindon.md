## Description

Harlindon was a green and fair land on the northwestern shores of Middle-earth. It was located west of the Blue Mountains and south of the Gulf of Lune which divided Lindon into the northern region of Forlindon and the southern region of Harlindon. At the head of the Gulf lay the seaport Grey Havens. There were woods at the foot of the Blue Mountains and a haven in a small inlet on the southern shores of the bay of Harlond. 

At the beginning of the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel lived in Harlindon before they moved to Eregion in SA 750.

## Etymology
