# Stoor-country

The **Stoor-country** refers to the regions where the Stoors originally settled. They first lived in the Vales of Anduin, near the Gladden Fields. Later, some of them migrated westward into Eriador and settled in the area that would become the Shire, particularly in the Marish region of the Eastfarthing.

Later still, some Stoors moved back to the Stoor-country. These Stoors made boats of reeds and were the ancestors of Sméagol and Déagol, who both lived in the Stoor-country.
