Alalvinórë was a wooded area of elm trees situated in the center of the island. Many towns and villages were here ringed around the city of Kôrtirion, the principal city in the center of the region. It was also the location of the Cottage of Lost Play, near Kôrtirion. It was known for being the fairest region of the island.

After the March of Liberation, Alalvinórë was the region in which Ingwion settled in along with the wisest among the returning Elves because they saw the region as being very fair. Ingwion built a great tower at the highest point of Kôrtirion. in a *korin* of elms at the base of Ingwion's tower in Alalvinórë.
