summary: Almaida was a shoreland town that apparently lay on the Bay of Andúnië in the north-western region of Númenor known as the Andustar. It seems to have been built a little further westward along the bay than the main city of Andúnië itself, but little more can be said of Almaida.

# Almaida

**Almaida** was a shoreland town that apparently lay on the Bay of Andúnië in the north-western region of Númenor known as the Andustar. It seems to have been built a little further westward along the bay than the main city of Andúnië itself, but little more can be said of Almaida. 

## Etymology
The name is only known from a single sketch-map of Númenor, where it is unintelligible, and is never mentioned elsewhere. The name is apparently Quenya but also it is incompatible with Quenya phonology as the sound *d* does not occur in Quenya names outside "nd", "rd" and "ld". It has been suggested that the actual word was misread by Christopher Tolkien.
