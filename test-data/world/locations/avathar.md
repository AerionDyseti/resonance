# Avathar

**Avathar** was a dark strip of land at the feet of the southern Pelóri mountain range in the continent of Aman.__NOTOC__

## History
Avathar was a wasteland devoid of all life save for the Great Spider Ungoliant whose home was there before she agreed to go with Melkor to Middle-earth. After Melkor left Valinor, the Valar, believing that their foe had fled to Middle-earth to his old hiding places, did not think him still in Aman and did not find him here.

## Etymology
***Avathar*** is a Quenya word that meant 'shadows' or 'the Shadows'.

### Earlier names
Tolkien's very first conception of Avathar, predating even the *Lost Tales*, was "**Habannan**", a place mentioned only in an early poem from 1915 entitled "Habannan beneath the Stars". Four name-changes then occurred before the publishing of : *Habannan *was emended to ***Eruman***, which became a name "interchangeable with ***Arvalin***". These names appear throughout the tales contained in . Eruman ultimately was changed to ***Araman****. Araman *and *Arvalin* shared slightly similar definitions: 'close to Aman' and 'beside Valinor'. The character Ungoliant was invented during the use of the name *Arvalin*, and her realm eventually was exclusively called ***Avathar***.
