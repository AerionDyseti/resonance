# Glanduin

The **Glanduin** was a river in the region of Eriador in Middle-earth and an eastern arm of the Gwathló.

Beginning in the Misty Mountains south of Moria, it flowed west-north-west until it was met by the Sirannon near the old location of Ost-in-Edhil, the capital of the Elven realm of Eregion. From there the Glanduin flowed towards the Hoarwell, which it met in the marshes known as Swanfleet or **Nîn-in-Eilph** north-east of Tharbad. From there on both rivers became the Gwathló.

During the days of Gondor's power the Glanduin marked the northernmost border of the kingdom in the west.

According to *The Atlas of Middle-earth*, it was approximately seventy-five miles in length. 

On some versions of the Middle-earth map the name *Swanfleet* appears to be an alternative name for the river, but in fact that name apparently refers to the marshes alone.
