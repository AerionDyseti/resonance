# Fangorn Forest

__NOTOC__

**Fangorn Forest **was a forest beneath the southeastern Misty Mountains.

It was known for being the last habitation of the Ents and Huorns. It was named after the oldest Ent, Fangorn (or Treebeard). It was also called **Entwood** by the Rohirrim.

## History

Fangorn Forest was the easternmost remnant of an immense forest spanning all of Eriador and Calenardhon in the First Age and early Second Age, that was reduced greatly by the Númenóreans felling trees to build their mighty ships, and amid Sauron's war on the Elves. The Ents from throughout these woods retreated into Fangorn Forest, and it would remain the oldest part of Treebeard's realm.

### Third Age
In late February of TA 3019, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took escaped from the Orcs that captured them and met Treebeard. They persuaded him of the danger that Saruman posed to the Ents and their forest. The Ents held an Entmoot and agreed to march against Isengard. Huorns were sent to Helm's Deep to assist in the Battle of the Hornburg.

On March 1, TA 3019, After the War of the Ring, Legolas took Gimli through the forest to experience its wonders.

## Etymology
The name ***Fangorn*** means "Treebeard", from the Sindarin *fang* ("beard") and *orn* ("tree").

The Quenya embellishment of Fangorn Forest was **Ambaróna**, which means 'Eastern Dawn', from the elements *ambarónë*, meaning 'dawn', and the suffix -(*h*)*rona*, meaning 'eastern', or 'east'.
