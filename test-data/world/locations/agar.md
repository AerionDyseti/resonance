# Agar

**Agar** was the name for the town in the story of Tal-Elmar while the land in the immediate vicinity was known as the Hills of Agar.

## Description
There is a small green hilltop overlooking the town. The town itself is situated on the side of the hill while around it are many fields. There is also a place called the Moot-hill, where the town-master gives meetings and announcements.

### Geography
On its location little information is given, except that it was a region of green hills, situated "three leagues away" from the shores of the Great Sea, and apparently closer to the ocean than the rival town of Udul. In a note near the end of the story there was a suggestion that the place was on the estuary of the Isen or perhaps the Morthond. There is also a hill between Agar and the sea known as the Golden Hill.

## Politics
The town was ruled by a town-master, who is known as the Master of Agar. The town-master during the time when Tal-Elmar lived in the town was named Mogru.
