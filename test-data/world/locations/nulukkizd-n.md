# Nulukkizdîn

**Nulukkizdîn** or **Nulukkhizdīn** was a hall of the Petty-dwarves on the river Narog.

## History
Nulukkizdîn was delved by Dwarves before the Elves were exiled from Valinor. Over the years, its population waned, and others were hunted to near-extinction by the Elves, who were unfamiliar with the Petty-dwarves. Nulukkizdîn was eventually abandoned, and repopulated by Elves. Finrod Felagund founded Nargothrond in its stead. After Nargothrond fell to Glaurung, the last Petty-dwarf, Mîm, reclaimed it, but he was slain by Húrin. Whether this is a true Khuzdul word or a Petty-dwarvish dialect is unknown, but circumstantial evidence points to the latter option. The Angerthas Daeron and its specific Dwarven variation Angerthas Moria, do not have a symbol for the letter *Î*. Other than in *Nulukkizdîn*, it only appears in *Khîm* and *Mîm*,

Tolkien's later notes on the origin of Nargothrond give a different Dwarvish name, **Nar(u)kuthûn**, derived from a Dwarvish name of the Narog, **Naruka*. Tolkien includes the words "of Petty-dwarves" between parentheses behind the mention of its Dwarvish origin. Whether Tolkien ever intended to replace *Nulukkhizdīn* with *Nar(u)kuthûn* is unknown.
