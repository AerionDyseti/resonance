# Nargothrond

**Nargothrond** was the stronghold built by Finrod Felagund which delved into the banks of the river Narog in Beleriand.

Nargothrond was the capital of the **realm of Nargothrond** between Nenning, Narog and Teiglin, including the surrounding hills of Taur-en-Faroth and the Talath Dirnen to the north, as well as Tumhalad. Finrod was the overlord of all the Elves in the West Beleriand, except the Falathrim.

## History
### Building

After the return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, Finrod and his brothers were established on north Beleriand with Fingolfin. In , he was visited in Tol Sirion by his cousin Turgon from Nevrast; both travelled together southward to Beleriand. While resting in the Meres of Twilight, Ulmo went to them and laid upon them a deep sleep and disturbing dreams. None told the other about his dreams, but both cousins began a search for hidden places in case Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband.

In , Finrod, who had now been a long guest of Thingol, marvelled at Menegroth and shared with Thingol his dreams and desire to make for himself a place in like manner. Thingol then told Finrod of caves under the High Faroth on west-bank of Narog, which few knew of, and provided him guides to lead him there. As Finrod came upon the Narog rushing down its steep course under the hills’ shadow, he resolved to make there a secret fortress and store-houses against evil days. In the far banks he saw the opening of many caves, and dwelling within were Petty-dwarves, the remnant of a once more numerous people who still lingered there and had in their language named this region *"Nulukkizdîn"*.

In this place Finrod carried out his designs in establishing great mansions, and in this labour he had at first help from the Petty-dwarves, for which he rewarded them generously.

In  the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains resumed their trafficking into Beleriand following their meeting and subsequent alliance with Finrod's cousin Caranthir. Finrod had further help from these Great Dwarves in extending his underground fortress, but these Great Dwarves despised the Petty-dwarves, and had no compunction in ousting them, especially for great reward. Mîm, the chieftain of the Petty-dwarves, thus developed a special hatred for the Elves, and attempted to murder Finrod in his sleep; this failed though, and he was driven out into the wild.

Among the other developments of Nargothrond, Finrod also raised an artificial hill, Amon Ethir, a league far from its gates.

### Days of power
Finrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined Beren in his quest for the Silmaril and handed rule to Orodreth. However, since the Dagor Bragollach Celegorm and Curufin, the sons of Fëanor, were defeated and retreated to Nargothrond where they were received as one of them. Although the city grew stronger because of this, the influence of the sons of Feänor became higher. Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at the time Finrod departed with Beren and were more powerful than Orodreth until Finrod's death was reported, at which time they were exiled.

### Fall

Túrin Turambar later came to Nargothrond and became one of its chief fighters, but he also persuaded the people to fight openly against Morgoth (the bridge was built at this time), which eventually led to its sack by the army of the dragon Glaurung.

### Legacy
Glaurung stayed there for about five more years guarding his stolen hoard until he went northeast to Brethil to assail Túrin and was killed by him at Cabed-en-Aras. Then, Mîm the Petty-dwarf settled there reclaiming his people's ancient home until he was killed by Húrin. Húrin entered the dark caves where the treasures Finrod brought from Valinor still lay there, but he brought out the Nauglamir.

The realm remained deserted for the rest of the First Age until the War of Wrath when it went down with the rest of Beleriand. Ages later, the realm will be remembered in Dwarven lore and mentioned by Galadriel.

## Etymology
From its first conception, the name ***Nargothrond*** means "Underground fortress on the river Narog". Its Petty-dwarvish name was ***Nulukkhizdîn*** (erronously spelled *Nulukkizdîn* in the published works).

However, in his later life, Tolkien devised the Dwarvish name ***Nar(u)kathan*** instead, to which the Elves suffixed *-rond*, "vaulted dome".

In Eriol's Old English translations, Nargothrond is referred as *Hlydingaburg* "City of the Hlydingas" or *Stangaldor(burg)*.
