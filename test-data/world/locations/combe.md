# Combe

**Combe** was a village in Bree-land. It was located northeast of the village Bree north of the East Road in a deep valley a little further eastward from Staddle, even many inhabitants from Combe were crowded on the road in Bree to watch their departure. On that day having walked for some miles on the East Road, Aragorn and the Hobbits could see rising smoke in a deep hollow north of the East Road that indicated where Combe was located.

The name *Combe* (*Coomb*) has been modelled on a relic of a "British" (i.e. Celtic) name that was chosen for its meaning, because the survival of traces of the older language of the Bree-men resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England.

David Salo suggests that *Combe* means "valley" and that it is a Celtic name, which is derived from British **kumba* and Welsh *cwm*.

The real-life Welsh place-name *Cwm* means "valley".
