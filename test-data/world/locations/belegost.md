# Belegost

**Belegost** was one of two great underground Dwarven cities in the Blue Mountains, the other being Nogrod, that prospered during the First Age. It was home to the Dwarves of Belegost.

## Geography
Belegost was delved in the eastern side of the north-central part and of the Blue Mountains northeast of Mount Dolmed guarding one of the only passes over the Blue Mountains not far from lake Nenuial.

## History
Belegost was founded during the Years of the Trees when the western Fathers of the Dwarves awoke from beneath the Blue Mountains.

In  the Dwarves of both Nogrod and Belegost became known to the Sindar, and though friendship between the Elves and Dwarves was cool, they had much profit of each other and Thingol welcomed them.

Around , the Dwarves of Belegost were called upon by Thingol to aid in the building of Menegroth. The Dwarves laboured long on this, though they were eager for new works and did so gladly; they ever demanded a price for their work, but considered themselves paid between receiving the wisdom of Melian and many fair pearls, including Nimphelos, from Thingol.

During the late First Age, Azaghâl was the Lord of Belegost until he was killed in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.

At the end of the First Age, Belegost was ruined in the War of Wrath. Around the  many Dwarves migrated from Belegost to Khazad-dûm. and brought much lore and craft with them. from *beleg* ("great") + *os(t)* ("fortress"). It was the translation of the original Dwarvish name into Sindarin.

Unlike other names of *The Silmarillion*, the text also gives us an English name, which was possibly from Westron: ***Mickleburg*** ("Great Fortress"). *Mickle* is a root meaning "big"; see also Michel Delving. It is notable that *[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Miklagar%C3%B0r Miklagarðr]*, also meaning "Great city", was the Old Norse name for Constantinople.

The Quenya cognate was ***Túrosto***.

## Other versions of the legendarium
On the Eastward Extension of the First 'Silmarillion' Map, the Dwarf-road crosses the Blue Mountains below Mount Dolmed, then turns to the south and continues until the edge of the map with the direction "Southward in East feet of Blue Mountans are Belegost and Nogrod". In the second version of the Earliest *Annals of Beleriand* and in the Later *Annals of Beleriand*, Belegost was in the east of the Blue Mountains and far south of Beleriand.

The position of Belegost was later moved by J.R.R. Tolkien to the north of Mount Dolmed on a photocopy of the Second 'Silmarillion' Map. in the revised version of the Later *Quenta Silmarillion*, and in the *Grey Annals*.

The position of Belegost is indicated on the southern slopes of the eastern spur of the part of the Blue Mountains, which is south of the Gulf of Lune on the First Map of *The Lord of the Rings* that was drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien, on the version of this map that was redrawn by Christopher Tolkien and published in *The Treason of Isengard* and on the 1943 Map of *The Lord of the Rings*, but not on any subsequent maps. on Christopher Tolkien's original map of The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age. This location is on a similar latitude as lake Nenuial.

## Portrayals in adaptations
In *The Atlas of Middle-earth'' Belegost was consciously placed far south of Nogrod and far south of Mount Dolmed on the map of eastern Beleriand based on the location of Belegost on the redrawing by Christopher Tolkien of the First Map of The Lord of the Rings, which shows the Ered Luin after the War of Wrath, although Karen Wynn Fonstad was aware of its different position by Christopher Tolkien on his Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North in the Silmarillion and of the changes in the narrative relating to the Dwarf-road and Belegost in The Shaping of Middle-earth that led Christopher Tolkien to place Belegost on his map. In addition, the dwarven name of Belegost is incorrectly spelled as **Gabilgathod**.
