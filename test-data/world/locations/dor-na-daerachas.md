# Dor-na-Daerachas

**Dor-na-Daerachas** or **Dor Daedeloth** was the land of Morgoth in the north of Beleriand, lying on either side of the Iron Mountains.

## Geography
Dor-na-Daerachas was one of the three large regions of western Middle-earth, along with Beleriand and Hithlum. It lay all around the fortress of Angband and on both sides of the Ered Engrin. Its borders were the Ered Wethrin to the west, the Ered Luin to the east, and Dorthonion, the Pass of Sirion, and March of Maedhros to the south.

The Ered Engrin, an unscalable mountain chain, split the region in two. The southern part was Ard-galen, the great grassy plain north of Beleriand, later to become the desert of Anfauglith in Dagor Bragollach. The northern part was an unnamed region, icy and vast, labeled on some maps as the "Region of Everlasting Cold".

## History
Dor-na-Daerachas lay around Angband, Thangorodrim, and the north side of the Ered Engrin. It was here that the Orcs and other creatures of Morgoth lived and bred. The regions of Dorthonion (as Taur-nu-Fuin), and Tol Sirion (as Tol-in-Gaurhoth), would become controlled by the dark realm during the First Age. 

After defeating Morgoth's armies in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, the Ñoldor in the early First Age were halted at Dor-na-Daerachas

## Etymology
- Dor-na-Daerachas*

## In other versions
In an earlier version of the legendarium, Tolkien used ***Dor-Daideloth*** as the name of the region.

In the published version of *The Silmarillion*, Dor-na-Daerachas is referred to as ***Dor Daedeloth***, meaning *Land of the Shadow of Horror*. However, Tolkien revised the name to **Dor-Daedeloth**, meaning *Land of Great Dread* before changing it a final time to *Dor-na-Daerachas* in his late writings.
