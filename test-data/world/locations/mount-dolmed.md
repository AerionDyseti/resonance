# Mount Dolmed

**Mount Dolmed** was a mountain located in the ancient Blue Mountains.

The Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost were established near Mount Dolmed.

## History

Mount Dolmed loomed over the only known pass from Eriador into Beleriand. It was here that, according to the Dwarves, two of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, the founders of the **Broadbeams** and the **Firebeards**, awoke. Their descendants later established the Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost.

After the War of Wrath the Blue Mountains were broken at the location of Mount Dolmed and an arm of the sea, the Gulf of Lune, broke through it. Mount Dolmed was completely destroyed together with Nogrod.

## Etymology
