# Bree

**Bree** was a village in Bree-land just to the east of the crossing of the East Road and the Greenway.

## Geography and description
Bree was the chief village of Bree-land, a small inhabited region east of the Old Forest and the Barrow-downs, west of Weathertop, south of Fornost Erain and north of the South Downs. Men and Hobbits lived together in Bree. It is claimed in the Red Book of Westmarch that the arrangement that Men and Hobbits each minded their own affairs in their own ways, but regarding each other as necessary parts of the population and being on friendly terms existed only in Bree-land. Both gates were closed and guarded by gatekeepers after nightfall who had small lodges on the inside of the gates. especially on the higher slopes above the houses of the Men. An inn called The Prancing Pony was located on the eastern side of the road where it curved to the south to go around the hill. Although few of them survived the turmoils of the Elder Days, they continued to settle in Bree when the Númenóreans returned to Middle-earth. Bree and the Bree-land became a part of the kingdom of Arnor and the Men of Bree abandoned their old language and adopted Westron as their native language. Bree probably became a part of Arthedain, one of the three successor states of Arnor, because Arthedain included the land north of the East Road as far as the Weather Hills and because most of the houses of Bree were north of the East road on the slopes of Bree-hill

Around  many Hobbits migrated westward from eastern Eriador and many settled in Bree. In  many Hobbits left Bree and went west beyond the river Baranduin and founded a colony within Arthedain, The Shire.

After the Fall of Fornost and Arnor in , the north-south road was only used seldomly and was referred to as the Greenway by the Bree-folk, because it had become overgrown by grass. Bree continued to exist with the unknown protection of the Rangers of the North. Even at the end of the Third Age Bree remained relatively prosperous. Bree was the most westerly settlement of men from the point of view of the Shire by the time of the War of the Ring and had a sizable Hobbit population. Thanks to its location near a major road crossing, one could encounter travelers including Men, Dwarves and Hobbits in a bustling Bree inn. The Rangers of the North also were known to stop in Bree.

On 15 March  Gandalf and Thorin met seemingly by accident at Bree. They were both thinking about the same problem: the Dragon Smaug at the Lonely Mountain. The meeting led to the undertaking of the Quest of Erebor, which resulted in the death of Smaug and the finding of the One Ring by Bilbo Baggins.

From about  on the wizard Saruman began to have agents in Bree.

On 29 September , Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee, Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took arrived in Bree and met Strider at the largest inn in Bree, The Prancing Pony, owned by Barliman Butterbur. In the morning of 30 September, , they discovered that the windows to their rooms had been forced open and that their stuffed beds had been slashed and left Bree on the same day.

When Frodo and his companions returned to Bree on 28 October, , Barliman Butterbur told them that Bree had been raided early in the year by ruffians from the south during the War of the Ring. Barliman Butterbur believed that they had been let into Bree by Harry Goatleaf and Bill Ferny, who had been on the side of the ruffians and who had fled Bree with them after they had lost the fight against the inhabitants of Bree. In the resulting set-to three Men and two Hobbits from Bree were killed. The defeated ruffians fled to the woods beyond Archet and the wilds where they lived as robbers so that travelling on the road was no longer safe. As a result the inhabitants of Breeland locked up their dwellings early, kept watchers all around the hedge and guarded the gates with a lot of men during the night. He also informed them that the Bree-landers had not understood how much the Rangers of the North had done for their safety, because after they all left (to fight in the War of the Ring in the south) wolves had howled around the fences in the winter and there were dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that make the blood run cold when he thought of them. After staying in Bree for two nights, Frodo and his companions left Bree on 30 October, .

After the War of the Ring at the end of the Third Age, the North-kingdom of Arnor was reestablished by Aragorn II. It is probable that Bree became a part of Arnor again and became more prosperous through increased traffic on the Greenway and the East Road, because Gandalf announced that the king would soon be turning his mind to Bree, the Greenway would be opened again, there would be traffic, there would be people and fields where there was wilderness before and that there would be room enough for people between the Isen and the Greyflood and along the shorelands south of the Baranduin and that many folk used to live at the northern end of the Greenway on the North Downs or by Lake Evendim.

Wayne Hammond and Christina Scull suggest that the name *Bree* is derived from the Welsh word *bre*, which means "hill". Tom Shippey also points out that *Bree* means "hill" in Welsh.

## Inspiration
J.R.R. Tolkien chose the name *Bree* to represent the survival of a trace of the former language of the Men of Bree and modelled it on a British (i.e. Celtic) word, which meant "hill". He referred to Brill in his Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings when he explained that the name Chetwood was a tautological compound of a Celtic word for "wood" and the english word "wood" and stated that the name *Brill* was derived from the Celtic word *bree* and the English word "hill". Tom Shippey also suggests that J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by the town of *Brill*, which is located on a hill ten miles from Oxford, when he chose the names *Bree* and Bree-hill.

An earlier manuscript about of the Heirs of Elendil, which later became the Annals of the Kings and Rulers and an earlier manuscript version of The Tale of Years mention that Bree was in Cardolan. It is possible that the statement that Bree was in Cardolan was deliberately not retained in the published text, because a statement was added in a later manuscript about the Heirs of Elendil that Cardolan was south of the Great Road before the existing statement that Cardolan was east of the Baranduin.

## Portrayal in adaptations

With the absence of Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-downs in most adaptations, the distance between Bree and the Shire seems shorter than it really was.

'*1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:After leaving the Old Forest, the Hobbits appear in the Prancing Pony without delay or introduction. The rooms were raided by Ringwraiths rather than servants of them.

**1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):**
:Here too, Bombadil and the Barrow-downs were omitted. After taking a short walk through Bree, the hobbits enter the Pony. Merry goes out for a walk, and is found by Bob the ostler. Once again, it is the Ringwraiths rather than servants of them who raid the Pony.

**2001: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'''''
:Frodo and his companions arrive at Bree almost immediately after the scene in which they leave the Shire. All are present in Strider's room when the  Ringwraiths crash the gate, trample the gatekeeper, and raid the Prancing Pony.

'*2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):**
:The role of Bree is greatly expanded, due to the interactiveness of the medium. It is the place where the Hobbits meet Strider, and the player shifts perspective. Strider searches the streets of Bree for Merry and materials to make decoys for (once again) the Ringwraiths to slash, while the streets are crowded with robbers and wolves.

**2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Bree is one of the major cities in the north, located in Bree-land, probaly the most important city in the game. It faces threats from several fronts: Sharkey's brigands have already began making their way into Bree-land, the Barrow-downs are stirring following the passage of the Nazgûl and a small band of Orcs has made their way from the North Downs. The citizens of Bree know more of the bigger world than Shire dwellers, but are still oblivious to the dangers they could face. The town's mayor and the watchers don't trust the Rangers of the North, insisting they can manage their own affairs. Later, during the winter of , Bree is overrun by Sharkey's Brigands and Half-orcs and has to be liberated by Free Peoples - an event references as "Thievery and Mischief" by Barliman Butterbur later.

'*2011: *The Lord of the Rings: War in the North*:*'
:Eradan, Andriel and Farin visit Bree in the beginning of the game, just a few days before Frodo reached the town. They meet with Aragorn in the Prancing Pony.
:Bree is protected by a dike and hedge and can be entered through two of its gates. The most important structures in Bree are the Prancing Pony, Elmund Brushwood's smithy and Adalgar Oldbank's shop. Several characters appear in Bree: Otto Aster, Harley Bramble, Elmund Brushwood, Barliman Butterbur, Grof, Tedder Hedgerow, Adalgar Oldbank and a Southerner, as well as several unnamed Bree-landers.

'*2013: *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug*:*'
:The opening scene takes place in Bree - once again featuring a cameo from Peter Jackson eating a carrot (see Albert Dreary) - where Gandalf and Thorin meet in the Prancing Pony. Gandalf tells Thorin of his meeting with Thráin, his worries about the dragon, and his wish to see Thorin retake the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf convinces Thorin that they need a burglar to retrieve the Arkenstone in order to summons the "Seven Armies" of the Dwarves.
