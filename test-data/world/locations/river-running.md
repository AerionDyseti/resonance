# River Running

The **River Running**, called **Celduin **by the Elves, was a major river of the region of Rhovanion.

## Geography
The river originated beneath the Lonely Mountain and flowed south to the Sea of Rhûn. The Redwater and the Forest River out of Mirkwood were both tributaries of the River Running.
The river was 600 Númenórean miles long, and ran from the Lonely Mountain south through the Long Lake, where it was joined by the Forest River, and thence through the eastern outskirts of Mirkwood. It then flowed southeast through apparently uninhabited regions of Rhovanion to its confluence with the Redwater. After this confluence, the River Running passed through the land of Dorwinion and emptied into the great inland Sea of Rhûn.thumb|298px|Overhead view of the River Running
