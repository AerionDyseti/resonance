## Overview

Dhampir Dragonmarked bearing the Mark of Xenirith, one of the three remaining Dragonmarked in the Shards of Xenerith campaign. Daughter of the vampire lord Alkandros cel Tradat and the elven scholar Lysanara, raised by the former Templar Abner Kassem after her mother's death.

## Background

Callidora's existence is a miracle — a dhampir child born to a vampire noble and his mortal beloved, defying the usual limitations of vampire reproduction. Her early life at Castle Rendakul ended in tragedy when Solaaran forces raided the castle, killing her mother Lysanara. Her father Alkandros survived but was forced into hiding, founding the Black Hand to protect vampire-kind.

The young Callidora was discovered by Abner Kassem, the very Templar who had slain her mother. Overcome with remorse upon finding the half-vampire child, Abner chose redemption over duty, leaving the Templars to raise her as his own daughter. He used his knowledge and connections to shield her from persecution for her dhampir heritage.

Against all odds, Callidora emerged as one of the Dragonmarked, bearing the Mark of Xenirith. Her cosmological adventures have taken her through the planes, exposing her adoptive father to truths about divinity and the afterlife that have shaken his former religious convictions.

## Personality

Pragmatic and direct, with a dry wit that emerges in the darkest situations. Her dhampir nature gives her a unique perspective on the conflict between light and shadow, life and undeath. She approaches problems analytically, assessing threats with cold precision before acting.

## Appearance

Bears the telltale signs of her dhampir heritage — pale skin, sharp features, and an otherworldly grace. Her eyes occasionally flash with crimson when her vampiric nature surfaces.

## Relationships

- **Alkandros cel Tradat** (Biological Father) — The vampire lord who leads the Black Hand. Their relationship is complex; he loves her deeply while seeing her as a living reminder of his lost Lysandra.
- **Abner Kassem** (Adoptive Father) — The former Templar who killed her mother but raised her with devotion. Their bond is unshakeable despite its tragic origins.
- **Lysanara** (Mother, Deceased) — An elven scholar of ancient artifacts who died protecting her daughter from Solaaran forces.
- **Fellow Dragonmarked** — One of three remaining bearers of the Dragonmarks in the current era.
- **Ana van Richten** — A vampire hunter who has targeted Callidora, knowing her dhampir nature.

## Goals and Aspirations

- Navigate her responsibilities as one of the Dragonmarked
- Reconcile her dual nature as both vampire's daughter and adopted child of a former Templar
- Protect those she cares about from the consequences of her heritage
