# Amnon

**Amnon** was a prophet of old according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. His most known prophesy was "*Great is the fall of Gondolin*", which was quoted again by Turgon, King of Gondolin, at the time the event took place.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first version of the Doom of Mandos appearing in *The Book of Lost Tales*, it is a servant of Vefántur who proclaims, among other misfortunes, the fall of Gondolin; and the Noldoli remembered those words as the "Prophecies of Amnos" (*Amnos* being the place where they had heard them). Later, Tolkien wrote a couple of notes referring to the "Prophecy of Amnon", with the words "*Great is the fall of Gondolin. When the lily of the valley withers then shall Turgon fade*", but it is unclear if here *Amnon* is a place or a person. As Christopher Tolkien suggests, the prophet Amnon could be the servant of Vefántur that proclaimed the doom of the Noldoli. 

## Inspiration
In the Bible, Amnon was the wicked eldest son of David. Tolkien was surely aware of this character (as he was a Catholic), and it is curious to speculate on his particular choosing of this name, as it was in his earlier works.
