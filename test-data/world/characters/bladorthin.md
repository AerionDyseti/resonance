# Bladorthin

**Bladorthin** was a great **King** of an unknown location within Middle-earth, sometime in the Third Age.

## Biography
Sometime during the mid- to late Third Age, Bladorthin ruled a kingdom which maintained armies and had an unspecified trade relationship with the Dwarven Kingdom under the Mountain. and *thin(n)* ("pale; grey") a variation of *thind*.

While J.R.R. Tolkien never elaborated on the meaning of *Bladorthin*, John D. Rateliff noted that the name was "clearly Gnomish (or perhaps Noldorin)". If this was the case, then *Bladorthin* would translate to "Grey Country", "Grey Plains Fay", or "Grey Master of the Plains" and therefore may be comprised of the Gnomish elements *blador* (which "probably applies to wide open country") and *-thin* ("grey").

Like Rateliff, Andreas Möhn also identified the name as Gnomish, however, he claimed that *blador* meant "wide earth, flat earth" and interpreted the whole name as "wide earth-grey" or "Grey One of the wide lands". He also speculated that the Quenya form of *Bladorthin* may have been **Palursindo**.

Unlike them, Michael L. Martinez did not believe that *Bladorthin* was Gnomish, noting not only that the element *-blad* only appeared in *Bladorion*, a name which Tolkien abandoned, but also that the element is similar in sound to "Blaed(a)", an Old English name for "renowned".

## In other versions
In the early drafts of , Bladorthin was the name of Gandalf (who would later be assigned the colour "grey" in *The Lord of the Rings*) for much of the narrative until Tolkien decided to change it late in the writing process. A connection can still be seen with the element *-thin* ("grey"). This theory is shared by J.E.A. Tyler and Michael L. Martinez, though Martinez also adds that he may have been a King of Dale who reigned long before Girion. The Tolkienwiki not only agrees with the theory of Bladorthin having a premature death, but also theorize that his kingdom was located around the Sea of Rhûn before being destroyed by Sauron. Andreas Möhn disagrees with most of the above theories, particularly the belief of his premature death since *The Hobbit* never mentioned Bladorthin's death as being premature. As a result, Möhn theorizes that Smaug's arrival in the year 2770 prevented the trade, implying that Bladorthin's death must have been sometime later. He also countered the theory that he was a King of Dale because Dale was never a kingdom before Bard. Möhn therefore identifies that his kingdom was actually located in Dorwinion. In addition, he also suggests that Bladorthin may have been related to the Kings Thorin mentioned who used to send for the smiths of Erebor, rewarding "even the least skillful most richly".
