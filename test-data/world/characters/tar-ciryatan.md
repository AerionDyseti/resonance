# Tar-Ciryatan

**Tar-Ciryatan**, or **Ar-Balkumagân** in Adûnaic, was the twelfth King of Númenor. His rule marked the first coming of the shadow upon the Númenóreans and their rulers; the speaking out openly against the Valar and the Ban, colonialism, and dominion abroad.

## Biography

Tar-Ciryatan was born in SA 1634 and was the son of Tar-Minastir. He loved ships and everything connected to ship-lore and ship building. His heart was restless in Númenor and before succeeding his father, he went on many voyages around the world travelling east, north, and south but never west as many yearned to do but never could because of the Ban of the Valar.

He succeeded his father in SA 1869, wresting the Sceptre from him prematurely. Tar-Ciryatan became a mighty king, building great armadas of ships, and the Númenóreans began large-scale colonization of the coasts of Middle-earth, holding the Middle Men in subjugation and demanding great tribute from them. As Tar-Ciryatan was greedy of wealth in these days, he received the pick of the many metals and gems that had been taken by his men in payment or as spoils of war.

He abdicated in SA 2029 after ruling for one-hundred and sixty years, and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Atanamir. He died in SA 2035.

## In adaptations

In a role-playing game, Ciryatan was referred to as the father of the Witch-king of Angmar, but this relationship is not founded in J.R.R. Tolkien's work.
