__NOTOC__

**Amárië** was a Vanyarin Elf of Valinor in Aman who was loved by Finrod.

## Biography
left|thumb|Finrod and Amárië reunited, by :Category:Art by Maureval|Maureval
Finrod, son of Finarfin, was a Noldorin prince who met Amárië in Valinor. Although in love with one another, they did not marry, and Amárië did not follow Finrod into exile Helcaraxë to Middle-earth. According to *The Grey Annals*, this was because she was not permitted. It is noted in the Lay of Lúthien that Finrod was allowed to return to life in Valinor following his death at the hands of Sauron during the Quest for the Silmaril, and he was reunited and dwelt with Amárië in Valinor.

## Etymology
- Amárië* is not given an interpretation within the legendarium. Paul Strack suggests that this Quenya name contains *márië* ("well, happily; goodness, good estate, being well"). Helge Fauskanger suggests that the name might be derived from *mára* "good". Another possibility is that *Amárië* includes the element *mar* "home". Ruth S. Noel makes a similar interpretation and defines *Amárië* as "Of the Home".

## In other versions
According to a version of the legendarium following the completion of , Felagund had a wife named **Meril** who went with him into exile and became the mother of Gil-galad. She was sent away by Felagund along with their son to her own folk at Eglorest in the Havens of the Falas during the Dagor Bragollach, due to Felagund fearing that there was no hope against Morgoth. This was later changed so that Finrod had no child - with Gil-galad becoming the son of Orodreth, Finrod's nephew - and Amárië remaining in Aman.
