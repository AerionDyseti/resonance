# Mauhúr

**Mauhúr** was an Uruk-hai of Isengard in the late Third Age, during the War of the Ring.

## Biography

Mauhúr was sent to reinforce Uglúk and Saruman's scouts as they returned to Isengard with Merry and Pippin, after the battle at Amon Hen and death of Boromir. He found them surrounded by Éomer's Rohirrim *éored* at the edge of Fangorn Forest, from which he led his Uruk-hai in an attack. However, despite Mauhúr's reinforcements, the Rohirrim were able to defeat the Orcs, killing some and driving away others. It is untold whether Mauhúr was among those killed or those driven away.

## In adaptations

### Ralph Bakshi's *The Lord of the Rings*

In Ralph Bakshi's animated film *The Lord of the Rings*, Mauhúr is one of two Orcs that guard the Hobbits.

### Peter Jackson's *The Two Towers*

In the Peter Jackson film *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*, where he was portrayed by Robbie Magasiva, Mauhúr was an Uruk-hai captain in the company that was sent to accompany Uglúk and the rest of Saruman's scouts as they returned with Merry and Pippin. He smelled the presence of Aragorn, prompting the Uruk group to travel faster.

During a night rest, Mauhúr complained about having no food except maggoty bread, which led to skirmish between Uruks and Orcs who wanted to eat the Hobbits. Suddenly they were surrounded by a group of Rohirrim, led by Éomer, who killed all the Orcs including Mauhúr.
