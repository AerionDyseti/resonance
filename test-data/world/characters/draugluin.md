# Draugluin

__NOTOC__

**Draugluin**, the **Father of the Werewolves**, was the first werewolf to be bred by Morgoth during the First Age of Middle-earth. He was the lord and sire of all werewolves in Beleriand.

## Biography
Draugluin was bred of the wolves of Angband and imbued with an evil spirit sent by Morgoth himself.  Draugluin was a dreadful, old and evil abomination, armed with fangs and claws. He dwelt with his master Sauron in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the former watchtower of Finrod Felagund which he helped conquer. 

He was slain by Huan during the Quest for the Silmaril after a long battle, though he informed Sauron of the hound's presence. Beren and Lúthien used his blue pelt to sneak into Angband.

From Draugluin's foul breed came Carcharoth and countless other offspring. It is probable the many Wargs of the much later Third Age were descended from him, as these wolves could speak, suggesting they possessed *fëar*.

## Etymology
***Draugluin*** means "Blue wolf" in Sindarin, from *draug* ("wolf") and *luin* ("blue") in reference to his blue hair colour. ***Drauglir*** was an earlier form of the name.
