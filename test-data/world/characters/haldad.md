# Haldad

**Haldad** was a leader of the Haladin in Thargelion.

## Biography
During his leadership, a swarm of Orcs assaulted his people. He created a defensive stockade between the two rivers Gelion and Ascar and where he was besieged by Orcs. They exhausted their food supply, and Haldad led a sortie against the Orcs, only to be slain. His son, Haldar, was also slain while trying to retrieve his body. His daughter, Haleth, led the Haladin through another week of starvation until one of the sons of Fëanor, Caranthir, came with his army and rescued them.
