# Brodda

__NOTOC__

**Brodda** was an Easterling who was made a lord in Dor-lómin by Morgoth following the Battle of Unnumbered Tears. He took possession of Húrin's lands and was eventually slain by Túrin.

## History
During the First Age, after Morgoth captured the land of Hithlum, Brodda was made a lord. He took to wife (against her will) Aerin of the House of Hador, a kinswoman of Húrin, and took Húrin's lands and possessions. When in  Túrin, son of Húrin, returned to Dor-lómin, he learned from Aerin that his mother, Morwen, had left Hithlum. In his rage he killed Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate, who burnt herself alive in her hall, and the remainder of the House of Hador now was persecuted even more cruelly.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
Brodda already appears in the earliest version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. The concept of the Easterlings invading Hisilómë was not present, but he is the lord of those lands inhabited by Men, as well as a horrible husband for Airin. When Mavwin decided to leave Hisilómë and asked to Airin that Brodda took care of her properties, he accepted without problem. But once Mavwin and Nienóri left, he added all her goods to his own, and did not take care her house or lands, so he was considered a bad lord and thief by his own people. When Turambar heard about this, became enraged and went to Brodda's hall. Airin was not there, but he was welcomed to the dinner party that was taking place, although he rejected the food they offered to him.

Seeing Turambar's crime, people in the hall revolted. Some did not appreciated Brodda and did not even unsheath their swords, but others attacked Turambar, of which Orlin was killed. Airin appeared and stopped everyone. She was shocked because of the crime commited, but spoke a favorable judgement against Turambar, recognizing how unfair Brodda had been towards Mavwin. Everyone approved, ignoring how horrible was Airin's life beside that man.
