# Thranduil

**Thranduil**, son of Oropher, was an Elven king who ruled over the Woodland Realm in the Third Age. Though inherently cautious, his army was key to victory in the Battle of Five Armies and he defended his realm against the forces of Sauron in the War of the Ring. He was the father of the Elven prince of Mirkwood, Legolas, who was a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.

In , Thranduil is referred to only as the **Elvenking**.

## Biography
### First and Second Ages
Thranduil was the only son of Oropher, King of the Woodland Realm. He was born during the First Age, and lived in Doriath at some point prior to the Second Kinslaying. At the beginning of the Second Age, some Sindar traveled east and Oropher eventually founded the Elven realm in Greenwood the Great.

In SA 3434, Thranduil and his father fought in the Battle of Dagorlad. Oropher was slain and Thranduil returned to Greenwood with roughly a third of the army that had marched to war.

In his realm, both Sindarin and Silvan Elvish were spoken,

After the death of the dragon Smaug, Thranduil supported Bard the Bowman's claim of a share of the treasure the Dwarves recovered from the Lonely Mountain, since Bard was a descendant of Lord Girion of Dale, and the treasure of that town had been taken by Smaug to the Lonely Mountain.

Thranduil led the Elven forces in the Battle of Five Armies. His army was positioned on the southern side of the Mountain, and was the first to charge. 

After the battle and Thorin's death, Thranduil took Orcrist, which was previously confiscated in Mirkwood, and laid it upon Thorin's tomb. The treasure was divided among Elves and Men, and Thranduil received the emeralds in the necklace of Girion, which he most desired. Bilbo, Gandalf and Beorn traveled with the Elf-host back to Mirkwood but would not stay in the woods, even when Thranduil asked them to.

When Bilbo and Gandalf bade farewell, Bilbo gave Thranduil a necklace of silver and pearls. The king gave Bilbo the title of "elf-friend" and returned with his host to their halls. He may have stayed on as the king of the Great Forest or left Middle-earth and departed to the Undying Lands.

## Etymology
- Thranduil* is a Sindarin word for "Vigorous spring", from *tharan* ("vigorous") and *ethuil* ("spring"). It was said that the name "Thranduil" was of Lemberin language (later Avarin or Telerian), along with other Sindarin names such as Legolas, Nimrodel, and Amroth among others.

### Titles
Thranduil first appears as a character in *The Hobbit,* where he is not named. J.R.R. Tolkien refers to him as *the elf-king* or *the king*, The name *Thranduil* first appears in , in which his title was given as the **King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood**. Though he was not seen afterwards, it was safe to assume that after the funerals and burials, Thranduil departed for Mirkwood.

### Voice dubbing actors

### Rankin/Bass's *The Hobbit*
In the Rankin/Bass 1977 animated version of ,, Thranduil was voiced by Otto Preminger. In this version he is a golden-haired, balding, green-skinned being whose people bear little resemblance to the more human-looking Elves led by Elrond. He captures Thorin's company after mistaking their approach for an attack, and despite their attempts to convince him otherwise he has them imprisoned. He and Bard later join forces to take the Lonely Mountain, only to quickly join forces with Thorin's army of Dwarves upon seeing the approach of the Goblin army.

### Radio
In the , he is voiced by Leonard Fenton.

### Video games
- Thranduil is also one of the playable Elven heroes in the real-time strategy game .

-  In , Thranduil's earliest appearances are during the War of the Last Alliance. He can be found during the Battle of Dagorlad and later is seen during the Siege of Barad-dûr.
-  In the present time, Thranduil is first encountered fighting in Mirkwood during the last days of the War of the Ring. He joins the forces of Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel and after a brief discussion their combined host moves on Dol Guldur where Galadriel brings down the fortress. Afterwards he and Celeborn renamed the forest Eryn Lasgalen and divide it into three parts, giving the middle section to the Woodmen of Western Mirkwood. Thranduil then returns to his halls in Felegoth where his son Legolas and the player join him after the One Ring is destroyed. Thranduil's people have to deal with an unexpected situation when most of spiders in Mirkwood, except for the very young or very old ones, suddenly depart the forest en masse, traveling south to answer the call of the source of the new threat and preventing it from reaching his borders.
