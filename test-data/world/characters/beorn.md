# Beorn

**Beorn** was a Northman, skin-changer, and chieftain of the Beornings who lived in the upper Vales of Anduin between Mirkwood and the Misty Mountains. He aided Thorin and Company during their Quest of Erebor. His kin lived in that region during the last centuries of the Third Age, guarding the Ford of Carrock from the Northern Orcs and the Wargs. He was the father of Grimbeorn the Old.

## Biography
### Third Age
Beorn was a warrior with great strength who could turn into a great black bear. In human-form, he was a tall, black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. Beorn kept many animals at his residence, such as horses, dogs, and sheep. His animals were all extremely intelligent; his dogs, for instance, could walk on their hind legs while carrying things with their forelegs, set the table, and able to speak. Beorn's horses could also understand what their master said. Beorn was also capable of speaking in the tongue of beasts, as he could communicate with bears. When he spoke to his dogs, his words sounded like "barks twisted into some form of speech".

### Later years
In the years following the Battle of Five Armies, Beorn became a great chieftain among the folk of the Vales of Anduin and his followers became known as the Beornings. At some point he became the father of Grimbeorn, later known as Grimbeorn the Old. Before the War of the Ring, Beorn passed away, and his son Grimbeorn succeeded him as chieftain.

## Character

Despite being incredibly powerful, Beorn respected all life forms, with the exceptions of Northern Orcs and Wargs, due to their malevolent and destructive tendencies. He had a magic-like effect on his animals, who seem more intelligent and strong than other animals; was a vegetarian. He kept bee pastures and spent his nights patrolling the woods and mountains in the form of a bear.  He was fairly decent, allowing Thorin and Company to stay at his home for a short while, offering sanctuary from the Northern Orcs. Beorn was also vengeful; when Thorin was fatally wounded in battle Beorn stormed the goblin ranks, rescues Thorin and then returns, destroying the Northern Orcs and killing Bolg himself.

## Etymology
- Beorn* is an Old English word, which originally meant "bear" but also "warrior", "hero", and "man of valour" (or poetic "man"). It is a cognate of Old Norse *björn* ("bear"). In the Scandinavian-speaking countries *Björn*/*Bjørn* is a personal name, attested since the 11th century.

In the *Etymologies*, Ilkorin *ber* ("valiant man, warrior") and Danian *beorn* ("man") derive from the Elvish root BER.

## In other versions
In early manuscripts of *The Hobbit*, the name of the character that would become Beorn is ***Medwed**''. Medwed's ability to change shape into a bear was due to an enchantment, perhaps of his own. It has been suggested that *Medwed* is a Slavic name with *medved* being a common Slavic word for "bear". *Medved* is also a taboo word for "bear" with the literal sense being "honey-eater". The same etymology is constructed by J.R.R. Tolkien for the Sindarin word *[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2314741507.html megli]* consisting of *mad-* ("eat") and *glî* ("honey"), and therefore meaning "honey eater", suggesting that Tolkien was aware of the slavic word.

## Inspiration
It has been suggested that the character Beorn was influenced by the Norse *Saga of Hrólfr Kraki*. In the saga appears a great bear defending Hrólfr Kraki, and also a man cursed to being transformed into a bear during nighttime. The work was well-known to J.R.R. Tolkien, as one of his students and friend, Stella Miller, made a translation of the saga that was dedicated to Tolkien, E.V. Gordon, and C.T. Onions. Another suggested inspiration is the character of *Beowulf*, "whose name is commonly explained as Beowulf = 'bees' wolf' = honey-eater = bear, and one who breaks swords, rips off arms and cracks ribs with ursine power and clumsiness".

### *Middle-earth Collectible Card Game*
In the *Middle-earth Collectible Card Game*, Beorn is a Character, with the Home Site Beorn's House.

### *The Hobbit: The Prelude to The Lord of the Rings*
In the GBA version of *The Hobbit: The Prelude to The Lord of the Rings* in 2003, Beorn is visited after Thorin and Company depart from the Carrock. In the console and PC versions of the game, Beorn appears only during the Battle of Five Armies and the ending cutscene, both times in the shape of a black bear.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy
Beorn is portrayed by Mikael Persbrandt in the films  and . His appearance in the films is quite different than his description in the book and portrayals in other media. In the films, he has greyish-brown hair, a forked beard, shackles on his left arm, and a mane of hair growing as a ridge down the length of his back. Beorn mentioned his fellow Skin-changers, who once lived in the mountains before Azog the Defiler came down from the north and killed or enslaved many of his people for sport. Beorn escaped the terrible fate of his kin (explaining the shackles on his arm), and claims that he is the last of his kind. He gives them horses to reach Mirkwood and provides escort to protect them from roaming Orcs. Beorn appears to be aware of the dark presence in Dol Guldur as he knows of an alliance between the Orcs of Moria and the Necromancer, whom he calls the Sorcerer, in Dol Guldur. Packs of Orcs have been seen gathering in the fortress with their numbers increasing every day. Beorn also knows that the Necromancer is not what he seems to be and that dark and foul things are drawn to his power, not to mention Azog's allegiance to him. He also heard word spread of the dead rising and walking near the High Fells of Rhudaur. He asked Gandalf if there actually were tombs in those mountains and Gandalf confirms the tombs as Beorn remembered a time when a great evil ruled the lands and had the power to raise the dead. If that evil had returned, he wished to know from Gandalf.

In *The Battle of the Five Armies*, he makes a brief cameo during the battle, shifting from man to bear form as he arrives with the Great Eagles, attacking several goblins and wargs. He is later seen at the funeral for Thorin, Fíli and Kíli.

Beorn's personality is notably different from what it is in the book. Instead of being boisterous and impatient, Beorn is depicted as soft-spoken and collected. Beorn is also said to be in little control of himself in the *The Desolation of Smaug*, but in the book, he can be tame and gentle as a bear, even following the Dwarves to ensure the return of his ponies when the Dwarves leave his house to go to Mirkwood.

### *The Lord of the Rings Online*
In , Beorn has a brief cameo in a flashback sequence, saving a child of the Woodmen of Western Mirkwood from Gollum "the child-snatcher".

## Trivia

- In the early film concepts, Beorn's bear form was rather monstrous, looking more like a Troll or Orc.
- In *The Desolation of Smaug* Beorn states that he "remembers" Sauron's heyday, four hundred years ago. His wording makes it unclear whether he lived during that time or if his people passed down stories of the Dark Lord's reign.
- At one point in film development, Beorn was intended to play a part in the Dol Guldur story-line, as speculated from his appearance in a LEGO set, 79011 "Dol Guldur Ambush".
