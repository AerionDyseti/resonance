# Chief of the guards (Woodland Realm)

The **chief of the guards** or **chief guard** was an Elf serving as leader of the guards of the Woodland Realm, in northern Mirkwood.

## Biography
The chief of the guards led King Thranduil's guards and was likely one of his many servants. One evening in TA 2941, he was coaxed by Galion in the king's cellars into testing some Dorwinion wine with him. As a consequence, he fell asleep with the king's butler. This allowed the hobbit Bilbo Baggins to steal his keys and release Thorin and Company from the king's dungeon. Bilbo then returned the keys, to reduce whatever trouble the chief guard would have with the king. When some Elves returned from the king's feast, they found the Galion and the chief guard, but only awoke Galion.
