# Urwen

**Urwen**, also known as **Lalaeth**

## Biography
Urwen was nicknamed *Lalaith*, because her laughter was compared to the merry sound of the Nen Lalaith, a stream from Amon Darthir that ran by the walls of Húrin's house in Dor-lómin, because she was a happy child and brought much joy to the hearts of the household of Húrin during her short life. Her hair was yellow like the lilies that grew in the grass fields of Dor-lómin. She often took to "going upon grass or under tree", singing old songs from long ago that were made when the Edain first learned "the tongue of the Elves". It was because of this that Húrin once said to Morwen that Urwen was as "fair as an Elf-child…but briefer". During his time in Nargothrond, Túrin spoke of Urwen to Finduilas, confessing to her that she reminded him of how he imagined his sister would look grown up.

Upon finding Níniel in the Forest of Brethil, Túrin mistook her as being similar to both Urwen and Morwen "in her looks and ways", and thus tragically causing him to wed her a few years later. and *gwen(d)* ("maiden").

- Lalaith* was a nickname derived from the Sindarin noun meaning "Laughter".

- Lalaeth* was a similar name to *Lalaith*, though it is not told whether it was a replacement or a variation of *Lalaith*.
