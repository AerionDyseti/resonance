# Eru Ilúvatar

**Erū Ilúvatar**, also known as the **One**, was the supreme being of Eä. He was the single omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent creator of existence. He had been existing eternally in the Timeless Halls and possessed the Flame Imperishable in his spirit, which has the power to kindle existence from nothingness.

Though the Ainur attempted to shape and govern Eä according to Erū's general will (which they understood imperfectly), he gifted his creations with the will to ultimately do as they pleased, and intervened directly in the affairs of Eä on only extremely rare occasions.

Erū was central to parts of , but was not mentioned by name in Tolkien's most famous works,  and , although he was alluded to as "the One" in a part of Appendix A speaking of the downfall of Númenor, and in "Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan" in  as "the One who is above all thrones for ever".

## Biography

Erū was considered transcendental, removed, and distant, existing beyond the affairs of Arda and was seldom worshiped and his name was too holy to be invoked.

Upon creating Eä, Erũ also created and fixed the natural laws and physical rules in which it will function, limited within impossibilities that can't be broken by any being, no matter how powerful or evil. Ilúvatar also set and fixed "the way of the World" in which the creatures would live. He then gave the Ainur the option to enter into Eä and fashion it as they would according to the Music. The greatest Ainur who chose to do so were called the Valar, and they controlled the shaping of Arda. This inability to create independent life was one of the primary reasons for the fall of Melkor, as he could not ultimately stand being forever lesser than Erū.

The subsequent activities and invocations of Erū are unclear. Manwë was the vicegerent Manwë also took counsel from Erū on several other important matters, including the fate of deceased Elven Fëa, the Pereldar, and the extension of the lifespans of the Númenóreans. During the Days before days Erū sanctified the creation of the Dwarves by Aulë, giving them life and sapience, and were his adopted Children. The Elves and the the Valar often praised Erū in the Undying Lands. Fëanor swore his Oath in the name of Erū. Later, it was said that Beren crossing the Girdle of Melian and meeting Lúthien was an intervention of Erū.

During the Second Age, The Númenóreans worshiped Eru in the Three Prayers held throughout the year, having the Meneltarma completely devoted to him. On the other hand, as both the Eldar and the Númenóreans knew that Erū was the only God, they held worship of any other person to be an abomination, save those who mistook Erū as one of the Valar. After drowning Númenor into a great chasm, he caused the Undying Lands to be taken "outside the spheres of the Earth". Several coincidences and signs of a higher providence occurred throughout the late Third Age, such as Bilbo Baggins finding the One Ring, the resurrection of Gandalf after he was killed by Durin's Bane, and the fall of Gollum into the fires of Mount Doom that indirectly caused the destruction of the One Ring. He that is alone"), and *Ilúvatar* ("Sky-father; Heavenly Father; Lord for Always; O Father;All-father; Father of All; God").

## In other versions
Erū Ilúvatar appears since the earliest form of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*. It is to be noted that Erū Ilúvatar* was also called ***Ainatar*** ("Holy Father"). The word *Erū* first appeared as an Adûnaic word: ***Êru***. It was first used as a Quenya word in a list of names of 1951.

## Inspiration
Tolkien understood Erū not as a "fictional deity" but as a name in a fictional language for the actual monotheistic God, although in a mythological or fictional context. In a draft of a letter of 1954 to Peter Hastings, manager of the Newman Bookshop, Tolkien defended non-orthodox aspects as rightly within the scope of his mythology, as an exploration of the infinite "potential variety" of God. Regarding the possibility of reincarnation of Elves, Hastings had written: 

Tolkien's reply contained an explanation of his view of the relation of (divine) Creation to (human) sub-creation: 

Hastings had also criticized the description of Tom Bombadil by Goldberry: "He is", saying that this seemed to imply that Bombadil was God. Tolkien replied to this:
