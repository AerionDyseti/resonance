# Saeros

**Orgol**, also named **Saeros**, was an Elf of mixed heritage, being one of the Laegeldrim Guest-elves of Doriath, and a "kinsman of the royal house" of Thingol on his mother's side. In pride, he begrudged the esteem shown towards Túrin, the human foster-son of Thingol, and would speak contemptuously to him. One evening, in the dining hall of Menegroth, Orgol provoked Túrin to such a point that Túrin cast a drinking vessel at Orgol's face. Their escalating feud eventually led to Orgol's unintentional death.

His death caused Túrin to leave Doriath, imposing self-exile on himself.

In the process of publishing the , Christopher Tolkien noted that, it became clear to him that J.R.R. Tolkien had "rejected the name *Saeros* and replaced it by *Orgol*", but Christopher decided against changing the name, to keep accord with . who sought refuge in Doriath following the death of their lord, Denethor, in the First Battle of Beleriand. His father, Ithilbor, was chief of the Guest-elves, and had been given a permanent place as a high counsellor in King Thingol's court in Menegroth. Though the Guest-elves dwelt mostly in the small land of Arthórien under their own chief, Orgol had dwelt in Menegroth for a long time. as Túrin approached manhood, he was permitted to join Thingol's marchwardens, and over the next few years he seldom returned to Menegroth, but won great renown for his strength and deeds of daring. Orgol entered the dining hall late and found his accustomed seat among the elders occupied by an unlooked for Túrin, whose appearance was unkempt and weather-stained. Orgol was angered by this, assuming that Túrin did this in pride to affront him, and his anger only grew upon finding that Túrin was welcomed, rather than rebuked, by the other elders. As a consequence, Orgol feigned to be of like-mind, and sat across from Túrin, claiming he was glad to yield his seat if it meant "the chance to speak with him". Orgol then asked many questions to Túrin about "news from the borders, and his deeds in the wild", but the mockery in his voice was clear. When Túrin grew weary of this, he frowned and no longer answered Orgol. Believing the frown was aimed at him, Orgol no longer concealed his anger and tossed his golden comb, "a dear treasure", in front of Túrin, stating that while Túrin's ragged cloak may be excused, there was no need to for his hair to be as tangled "as a thicket of brambles", and perhaps he would hear better then. Túrin still said nothing, but gave Orgol a warning glare. Orgol returned his gaze with scorn however, and then asked, loud enough for everyone to hear, that if the men of Hithlum were so wild, did the women of Hithlum run naked and wild like deer?

Orgol's cries were heard by others who then joined the chase, "but only the swiftest could keep up", and Mablung was at the head of these. Mablung called on Túrin to hold his pursuit, but Túrin persisted, and sprang again on Orgol. In despair, Orgol, wildly ran to a deep cleft where stream that fed the Esgalduin passed through. Orgol attempted to make the wide leap across it, but he lost his footing on the other side, and broke his neck on impact with a great rock in the water. When Thingol eventually returned to Menegroth at the end of summer, he held a trial around these events and was initially going to decide that, while Orgol was to blame for everything, Túrin was at fault for his shaming and death. However, Beleg brought in Nellas, a childhood friend of Túrin, who revealed that, unknown to both Túrin and Orgol, she witnessed the entire encounter as she had been sitting in a tree to look upon Túrin as he left. adjective *sear* ("bitter"), the Sindarin noun *ross* ("rain; spindrift, spray; foam"), or the Sindarin element *-os* ("augmentative suffix").

### *The Book of Lost Tales*
In "Turambar and the Foalókë", from , ***Orgof**'' "is explicitly a fop and a fool". He was an Elf of mixed Ilkorin and Gnome heritage. He was in some favor, as he was a good hunter and an Elf of prowess, but was loose with his tongue, and overconfident due to his standing with the king. He was extremely fond of fine garments, jewels, gold, and silver, and clad himself extravagantly. Orgof was jealous of the esteem shown to Túrin, and would thus frequently jest with barbed words whenever they sat together at the king's board, especially about Túrin's rough appearance; Túrin never responded however, and gave no heed to him.

The implication then became that Morben were either allies of Morgoth, or at least of dubious loyalty and weaker in resistance to his pressure and lies. It thus became one of Orgol's worst insults to refer to Túrin's mother "Mor**w**en" as "Mor**b**en", and a reason for Túrin to smote him.

Within the *Narn i Hîn Húrin*, Orgol is called *Saeros* and is described in one draft as Daeron's kinsman, and in another as his brother.
