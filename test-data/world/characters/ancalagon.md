# Ancalagon

**Ancalagon**, often titled "The Black", was the greatest of all winged dragons. He was bred by Morgoth during the First Age and was the largest dragon to have ever existed in Middle-earth. His appearance in history was restricted to the War of Wrath.

## Biography
After Eärendil made his journey to Valinor to convince the Valar to overthrow Morgoth and rescue the overmatched and defeated Elves and Edain, the Host of Valinor made war upon Morgoth and destroyed his armies. thumb|center|Ancalagon the Black, by Ruben de Vela|367x367pxFacing final defeat, Morgoth unleashed his last and greatest weapon; a fleet of winged fire drakes, led by Ancalagon. So terrible was their onslaught that the armies of the Valar were driven back from the gates of Angband, and their coming was said to have been accompanied by great thunder, lightning, and a tempest of fire.
But Eärendil came out of the West in his blessed ship Vingilot, accompanied by "a myriad" of the Eagles of Manwë led by Thorondor. The Eagles and Eärendil dueled with Ancalagon and the other dragons for a day. Eventually, Eärendil was victorious, casting Ancalagon down upon Thangorodrim, destroying the volcanic mountains in his fall. The death of Ancalagon marked the end of Morgoth's final resistance.

### Legacy
Gandalf spoke of him as he told Frodo Baggins the true origin of the One Ring. "It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself."

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English Middle English] translation for *Ancalagon* is **Andracca**, from *and-* ("opposition"), *anda* ("hatred, envy"), and *draca* ("dragon").

However, his size cannot be assumed to be larger than Thangorodrim; some powerful but comparatively small creatures are able to cause great destruction even in death, such as Durin's Bane breaking the slopes of Celebdil. His size would however, still have needed to have been great enough to strike and destroy all three peaks as he fell, and each mountain was about five miles across.  

Like all other Urulóki, Ancalagon breathed fire, which was implied to be hotter than any other dragon's flame.

## Trivia
- In 1977, an extinct genus of worms found in the The Walcott Quarry on Fossil Ridge in 1911 dating from the Middle Cambrian Era from the Cambrian Burgess Shale was named *Ancalagon*, inspired by Tolkien's dragon.
