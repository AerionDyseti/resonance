## Overview

Azraian Tiefling Rogue, one of the player characters in the Heroes for Hire campaign. Currently time-displaced from the Age of Enlightenment to the Age of Mythology (-1 MR).

## Time Pool Visions (Session 9)

### Past (Slow Pool)

Saw herself as a young orphan girl—dirty, alone, with nothing but the mysterious amulet she keeps hidden.

### Present (Medium Pool)

Saw Bran, Tephysea, and Kora. Tephysea and Kora looked worse for wear; Bran may have been dead (ambiguous).

### Green Pool

Became transfixed, heard flames growing louder, couldn't look away—until the Time-Lost Dunamancer appeared and interrupted, miming an explosion and pointing in opposite directions.

## The Mysterious Amulet

Sonder possesses a mysterious keepsake from her orphan past. It is inscribed "Baaros" on the inside—a name connected to one of the founding families of Azrai, the tiefling homeland that doesn't yet exist in the current timeline.

## Campaign Highlights

### Heroes for Hire

- Time-displaced along with companions to the Age of Mythology
- Protected under Dro'adi child-protection laws in Vrasillex (3 "lines" of protection, 2 remaining)
