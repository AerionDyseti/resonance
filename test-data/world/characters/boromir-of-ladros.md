# Boromir of Ladros

**Boromir** was an Adan of the House of Bëor.

## Biography

Boromir was the elder son of Boron, the third chieftain of the folk of Bëor, and the great-grandson of Bëor the Old. He also had a younger brother named Belegor, about whom little is known. Boromir became the fourth Chieftain of the House of Bëor after the death of his father. When the Elven kings decided to grant lands to the chieftains of the Edain, Boromir was granted the land of Ladros in Dorthonion as a fief under the Elven-lords Angrod and Aegnor, the younger sons of Finarfin (the Ñoldorin king in Aman) and the brothers of King Finrod of Nargothrond. He thus became the first Lord of Ladros. 

Boromir was the father of Bregor, his first child and only son, Andreth his second child and elder daughter, and Beril his last child and younger daughter.

Two later Lords of Gondor and warriors of renown were named after Boromir son of Boron, including Boromir of the Fellowship of the Ring.
