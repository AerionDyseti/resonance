# Denethor II

**Denethor II** was the twenty-sixth and last Ruling Steward of Gondor, and father of War of the Ring heroes Boromir and Faramir.

## Biography
Denethor was the third child and only son of Ecthelion II. Together, the couple had two sons, Boromir and Faramir. A few years later, in TA 2988, Finduilas died young, leaving Denethor embittered.

He succeeded his father Ecthelion II as twenty-sixth Ruling Steward in TA 2984. During his stewardship, Gandalf was less welcome in Minas Tirith, and his counsels went unheeded.

### War of the Ring
In later life, Denethor secretly used a palantír to probe Sauron's strength, using it at the top of the White Tower in a secret chamber above the throne room. The effort aged him prematurely, and although Sauron was not able to bend him to his will as he had Saruman, knowledge of the Dark Lord's overwhelming forces exacerbated the bitterness that had taken root at the time of the death of his wife.  

Denethor was well aware that Sauron's assault on Gondor would come during his lifetime and prepared accordingly, even though he increasingly came to believe that the struggle would be hopeless. In TA 3018 when Sauron attacked Osgiliath, he found the strength and preparedness of Denethor greater than he had expected or feared. Minas Tirith was fully provisioned for a siege and as war loomed Denethor sent away from the city the old, the women and children and had the beacons of Gondor lit, dispatching errand-riders with the Red Arrow to Théoden of Rohan to summon aid.

The death of Boromir, his eldest and favorite son, and the siege and apparent doom of Gondor drove Denethor further along the path of despair. Following this news and the passage of Frodo Baggins through Ithilien he became estranged from Faramir, though Faramir still upheld his father's wishes. After his death the Anor-stone would only show Denethor's hands slowly withering in flame, unless the viewer had great strength of will to turn it to other visions.

## Etymology
- Denethor* had been the name of the tenth Ruling Steward of Gondor, who, in turn, was named after a king of the Nandorin Elves.

The name comes from the Nandorin words *dene* ("strong, lithe") and *thara* ("tall, slender"), and gives the name a meaning of "Lithe and lank".
