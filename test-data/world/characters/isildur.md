# Isildur

**Isildur** was the oldest son of Elendil and the brother of Anárion. He and Anárion founded and jointly ruled Gondor in the south, while their father dwelt in Arnor in the north.

In the War of the Last Alliance at the end of the Second Age, Isildur cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand, but refused to destroy it. Early in the Third Age, Isildur was betrayed by the Ring which slipped off his finger during the Disaster of the Gladden Fields, leading to the Orcs killing him and Ring being lost for nearly 2,500 years. His refusal to destroy the Ring allowed Sauron to endure and remain a threat to Middle-earth. Isildur's bloodline survived in the Dúnedain of the North, and his heir would help end Sauron's power in the War of the Ring.

## Biography
### Life in Númenor
Isildur was born in Númenor in the year SA 3209 of the Second Age. His younger brother Anárion was born in SA 3219. They lived at the haven of Rómenna on the east coast of the island of Númenor. Their father was Elendil and their grandfather was Amandil, the Lord of Andúnië. The Lords of Andúnië were descended from the Kings of Númenor through Silmariën, the daughter and eldest child of the fourth King of Númenor, Tar-Elendil.

As Sauron's influence increased, the Faithful began to prepare to leave Númenor. They filled nine ships with their families and many of their prized possessions, including the palantíri. Isildur had three ships of his own, and he brought aboard the seedling of the White Tree, the Stone of Erech, as well as his wife and his son Elendur, who had been born in SA 3299.

Isildur lived in Minas Ithil to the east of the Anduin, while Anárion made his home in Minas Anor to the west of the Anduin. They ruled from their joint capital of Osgiliath, built on both banks of the river. Isildur built Minas Ithil in a valley of the Mountains of Shadow on the border of Mordor, planting the White Tree of Gondor before his house there. Minas Ithil was a beautiful city, but it was also a stronghold to defend against the evil that might still dwell in Mordor. It was not known at first that Sauron had survived the Downfall and had begun to rebuild his strength.

Isildur had one of the palantír called the Ithil-stone, which he used to communicate with his brother and father. Isildur and his wife had two more sons while living in Gondor - Aratan born in SA 3339 and Ciryon born in SA 3379.

In the early days of Gondor, Isildur went to the Hill of Erech at the entrance to Imlad Morthond in the White Mountains. On the hilltop he placed the Stone of Erech, a great black sphere that he had brought from Númenor. Isildur met with the King of the Mountain Men, who swore allegiance to Isildur upon the Stone, but later when Isildur called upon the Men of the Mountains to join the fight against Sauron, they refused. Isildur cursed them and said that they would never rest until they fulfilled their oath, and they haunted the Paths of the Dead.

Sauron attacked and captured Minas Ithil in SA 3429. Isildur escaped with his wife and sons and a seedling of the White Tree. Isildur and his family boarded a ship at the Mouths of the Anduin and sailed around the coast of Middle-earth, seeking Elendil in Arnor. Elendil consulted with Gil-galad, the last High King of the Ñoldor in Middle-earth who lived in Lindon west of Arnor. Gil-galad and Elendil formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men to oppose Sauron in SA 3430. That same year, Isildur's youngest son Valandil was born at the home of Elrond in Rivendell.

### The Last Alliance
The army of the Last Alliance gathered at Rivendell in SA 3431 Not long after, with the heat-induced markings on the Ring still visible, Isildur wrote a short account of the Ring and its apparent properties, noting that it had burned his hand so badly that he believed he would be in permanent pain. He noted that the Ring, as it cooled, seemed to shrink, and that the writing upon its outer band seemed to be fading. He theorized that the heat from Sauron's hand might have caused the writing to remain visible, and that heating it again might produce the same effect. However, he was already so enthralled by the Ring that he refused, even in writing, to take any action which might cause harm to it.

### Rule and death
Isildur assumed kingship of both Gondor and Arnor, but intended to return to the North and leave Anárion's son Meneldil to rule in the south, after mentoring him in the duties of a King. On the summit of Amon Anwar in the Firien wood, Isildur entombed the body of his father Elendil. Before leaving Minas Anor, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree recovered from Minas Ithil in memory of his brother and established the Tradition of Isildur.

During the few years in which Isildur had possession of the One Ring, he indicated that he had attempted to bend its tremendous power to his own will. However, he had failed in this endeavor, and the Ring's effects on his psyche had continued to grow until he could hardly bear it any longer. His eldest son and confidante, Elendur, suggested to his father that he should give the Ring into Elrond's keeping, and Isildur agreed.

Before the battle had begun, Isildur had sent away his esquire Ohtar, bearing the shards of his father's sword Narsil. Isildur kept the One Ring, but it was useless in defending his men against the Orcs.

Isildur's son Aratan was mortally wounded, and his son Ciryon was killed. His eldest son Elendur begged him to flee to in order to prevent the Orcs from capturing the Ring. Isildur agreed and parted with great sorrow from Elendur, who was slain leading the remaining Dúnedain.

Isildur put on the Ring despite its pain and made for the River Anduin. He removed his armor and waded into the river intending to try to cross it. The current was strong and despite his great strength, it pulled him toward the marshes of the Gladden Fields. Then the Ring betrayed Isildur by slipping off his finger, and it then became lost in the waters. He rose out of the water but was spotted by Orcs who killed him with arrows.

### Legacy
The One Ring remained at the bottom of the Anduin river in the Gladden Fields until Déagol found it in TA 2463. but he did not claim the Kingship of Gondor, and the two Kingdoms became separated. Gondor continued to be ruled by the heirs of Anárion, while Arnor was ruled by the heirs of Isildur. It was not until the end of the Third Age that the Kingdoms were reunited by Aragorn II, Isildur's heir. During his reign, evidence for the full story of his death was finally uncovered, as the Elendilmir and the necklace holding the One Ring were found in a secret chamber in Orthanc. Saruman had likely found Isildur's remains and had them burnt.

#### Season One
At the encouragement of his father Elendil, Isildur has undergone rigorous training to become a member of the Sea Guard of Númenor, along with his friends Valandil and Ontamo. However, he has heard a mysterious voice calling him back to the island and begun to rethink what he desires to pursue after hearing of the doings of the Faithful on the western coast of the island from his brother Anárion. Isildur tells his father of his plan to defer the final trials of his training, though his sister Eärien reveals the hand Anárion had in the decision, and Elendil sternly warns his son against the move, believing that his family must move on from the past to have a successful future.

Isildur does return to the ship, but upon hearing the voice call to him again, releases a rope, knowing this will get him dismissed as a cadet. However, the Ship-master dismisses Valandil and Ontamo as well, much to Isildur's horror, and his friends' shock. Valandil makes angry accusations of Isildur's motivations and worthiness of being a cadet in the first place, and Isildur leaves to find Eärien, in whom he confides. It is then that the city of Armenelos is put on notice that Galadriel has escaped from custody. 

Eventually, despite Queen-regent Míriel's judgment that Galadriel must return to Middle-earth alone, Míriel changes her mind when the leaves of Nimloth begin to fall, indicating a grave warning, and announces plans to escort Galadriel back with an army. Elendil is put in charge of finding volunteers, and Isildur attempts to follow Valandil and Ontamo's lead in pledging to go, though Elendil at first denies him the opportunity. Isildur pleads with Valandil, recently promoted to lieutenant, to secure him a place, but is rejected. Isildur then tries to stow away but is surprised to find Pharazôn's son Kemen on board, sabotaging the mission. Isildur rescues Kemen from the ensuing explosion, though two of the five allotted ships are destroyed. Isildur, perhaps as a favor for saving Kemen, is granted a place on the expedition, though at first only as a stable-sweep. On the voyage eastward he briefly meets Galadriel, who encourages him to not lose heart at his low position.

Upon landing on the banks of the Anduin, the contingent led by Míriel and Elendil crosses the Ephel Dúath into the Southlands, and at dawn arrive in Tirharad. Isildur is at first kept back from the fighting, though Míriel permits him to enter the conflict when Elendil becomes beset by several Orcs, and Isildur rushes to his father's side after Halbrand saves Elendil. After the Orcs are defeated, Isildur tends to his horse Berek, who strangely displays spooked behavior until Elendil comes and calms the horse by speaking Sindarin, promising Isildur to one day teach him how to do the same. Just then, however, all the Númenóreans and Southlanders are taken aback when Orodruin erupts. In the ensuing chaos and thick ash, Isildur saves Míriel from a burning structure but is trapped within when it collapses, leading his kinsmen to presume him dead.
