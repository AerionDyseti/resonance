## Background

### Overview

Matriarch of House Sennet and emblem of the Cultivators' priorities in Lux. Dutiful and politically astute, she balances familial obligations with inter-house diplomacy; her decisions frame the falcon case's moral and political stakes.

Elder Yara is the matriarch of House Sennet, one of the prominent noble houses in the city. She resides in the prestigious Cultivators District, where she maintains an extensive garden and aviary on the top floor of her residence. As an elder of her house, she carries significant political weight and is involved in diplomatic relations with other nations.

Recently, her prized Gyr Falcon, Iri, was stolen from her aviary, creating a potential diplomatic crisis. House Sennet bred and raised the falcon for the Steward Caste, who are responsible for presenting it as a diplomatic gift to representatives from Highwind, a nation now at peace with Solaarus. This theft threatened House Sennet's obligation to House Medjay and could escalate into a formal grievance, sparking a lasting feud between the noble houses.

Elder Yara lives with her grandson Kael, whom she cares for but maintains a somewhat distant relationship with. Her position requires her to make difficult decisions, including giving away Iri despite her grandson's emotional attachment to the bird.

## Personality

Proud. Astute. Protective of kin and house reputation. Prefers quiet leverage over public spectacle.

Elder Yara is a cautious and politically astute individual who values proper protocols and hierarchies. She displays initial skepticism toward unconventional approaches, particularly when adjudicators become involved in matters she believes should be handled by the Judicator Caste. Despite her reserved nature, she can be reasoned with through careful diplomacy and respectful persuasion.

She carries herself with the dignity expected of a house elder, but shows pragmatic flexibility when convinced that unconventional methods serve her interests. Elder Yara appears to prioritize her house's political standing and diplomatic obligations, even when it conflicts with personal relationships.

## Appearance

Gray-streaked hair woven with flowers and seeds. Green robes bearing Cultivator insignia. Hands stained by soil despite noble rank.

### Notable Characteristics

- Carries seed pouches as gifts and signals
- Uses agricultural metaphors to disarm opponents
- Keeps a hawker's whistle for Iri at her belt
- Often seen working in her gardens, indicating hands-on involvement in her household

## Relationships

**House Medjay** — Currently in tension due to the falcon theft, which she initially suspected was their doing.

## Goals and Aspirations

- Resolve the falcon affair without conceding House Sennet's standing
- Protect agricultural interests against Steward-caste overreach
- Secure apprenticeships and alliances for the next generation
- Maintain House Sennet's political standing and diplomatic relationships
- Balance her house duties with her role as Kael's guardian

- Authorized the party to investigate her residence and aviary despite initial skepticism
- Balanced house protocol with the party's discreet plan to report to the Prefect first
