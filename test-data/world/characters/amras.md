# Amras

**Amras** and his younger twin brother, Amrod, were Ñoldorin princes, the youngest of the seven Sons of Fëanor. Through their mother Nerdanel's line, they inherited red hair, instead of Fëanor's dark hair.

## Biography
### Life in Valinor
Amras, and his twin Amrod, were born sometime in the Years of the Trees. Nerdanel initially named both twins *Ambarussa* and, when Fëanor begged that their names should be different, she then provided *Umbarto*, though not to any twin specifically. Either disturbed by such an ominous name, or because he misheard her, Fëanor changed it to *Ambarto* and gave it as the mother-name to Telufinwë, the younger twin. but the younger twin, Amrod, had a darker shade of red hair after childhood and was dearer to Fëanor. Fëanor and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but traveled far and wide upon the confines of Valinor, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. They were often guests in the halls of Aulë. Along with Finwë, the sons of Fëanor did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Melkor and Ungoliant after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses. Once the cloud passed, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen. They then sped to the Ring of Doom where Maedhros informed Manwë and, unknowingly, Fëanor who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Fëanor reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Fëanor followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.

Fëanor and his sons soon returned to Tirion where, during a great speech by Fëanor, they took a terrible oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dared to claim any right in the Silmarils, and led most of the Ñoldor into exile. As Fëanor was preparing his host for Exile and to return to Middle-earth, Nerdanel approached him and begged that he should leave her youngest twin sons, or at least one of them.

### Return to Middle-earth
In the morning after the Burning of the Ships at Losgar, Amras noticed the absence of his twin brother Amrod. He explained that Amrod was restless and did not sleep on the ground out of discomfort. He was the last to speak about this matter to Fëanor.

Later, Amras and his brothers rescued their father who died in an ambush after Dagor-nuin-Giliath. After Fëanor's death, he settled the wide plains of East Beleriand between the rivers Celon and Little Gelion where few folk dwelt, and took it as his realm and hunting-ground. He became renown as a great hunter of the woods, though not more than Celegorm. but he was present at each kinslaying. If his brothers needed aid or shelter, he supported them. Amras died during the attack made by the Sons of Fëanor on the Havens of Sirion in 538.

## Etymology
***Amras*** is a Sindarin word. His father-name is **Pityafinwë** "Little Finwë", from *pitya* ("little"). Its shorter form was **Pityo**. His mother-name was **Ambarussa** "Top-russet", the name he and his brother called each other.

### Other names
Like the rest of his brothers, Amras was given an Old English name. He was called **Tirgeld**, from the words *tir* ("glory") and *geld* ("of worth").

## Other versions
In , Amrod lives beyond the burning of the ships, and follows Amras to East Beleriand where they held the lands of Estolad together. They share the same fate, dying during the Third Kinslaying. In later writings, Christopher Tolkien added the death of Amrod. For this reason, wherever both Amrod and Amras appear in the published material it should be read as Amras alone.
