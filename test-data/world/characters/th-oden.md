# Théoden

**Théoden**, son of Thengel and Morwen Steelsheen, was the seventeenth King of Rohan, last of the Second Line of the royal House of Eorl.

## Biography
### Early years
Théoden was the only son of Thengel, and became king after the death of his father in TA 2980. Théoden spoke Sindarin and Westron more often than Rohanese, due to the influence of his father, and spent a part of his youth growing up in the mountain vales of Gondor, his mother's homeland.

He challenged the Witch-king of the nine Ringwraiths, and was mortally wounded when his horse Snowmane fell upon him after being spooked by the Witch-king's winged steed. He was quickly protected by Éowyn and Merry, both of whom had ridden to war in secret.

After his death, the Rohirrim minstrel Gléowine composed a song for him and the other Kings of Rohan.

## In other versions
In one of J.R.R. Tolkien's early drafts of his  story, Théoden also had a daughter named Idis. She often appeared alongside her cousin Éowyn, but never spoke, and was always overshadowed by her.

### *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy

Théoden, portrayed by Bernard Hill, is a major character and secondary protagonist in Peter Jackson's . He appears in  and . Théoden is depicted as a considerate leader and mighty warrior who does not believe that Sauron can be defeated; however, he wishes to die with honor and make him and his people "worthy of remembrance."

In *The Two Towers*, Théoden is initially outright possessed by Saruman, in a deviation from the books. While under Saruman's spell, Théoden appears extremely aged, with grey hair and glassy eyes, and is unwilling to defend Rohan from the Dunlendings and Uruk-hai pillaging the Westfold. After Théoden's son Théodred is killed by Orcs, the new heir Éomer is banished by Wormtongue (on "orders" of the king) from Edoras; he takes with him some 2,000 Rohirrim riders.

Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas arrive in Edoras and Gandalf frees Théoden from Saruman's spell. The king recovers his sanity and a healthy appearance, and banishes Gríma (though originally desiring to execute the spy). Théoden mourns his son and decides that the best way to defend his people is to evacuate the people of Edoras to Helm's Deep, a decision Gandalf criticizes.

In *The Two Towers*, Théoden seems unsure as to whether his countrymen can fend off Saruman's hordes. Before the Battle of the Hornburg, he poetically expresses his belief that the world of men is soon to be destroyed. As the Uruk-hai overwhelm the fortress, he seems resigned to his fate; when he "rides out" with Aragorn on a final suicide charge, it is more so in order to die with honor than to actually defeat the Uruk-hai. However, Gandalf arrives during their charge and liberates Helm's Deep. The victors ride to Isengard to challenge Saruman, only to find the Ents have already defeated his forces and sealed him in his tower. Saruman attempts to persuade Théoden to make peace with him, but the king rejects him. Seeing Gríma atop Orthanc, he offers to grant him clemency, but as the former man of Rohan wavers, Saruman strikes him down. In revenge, Gríma stabs his master in the back before being felled by Legolas' arrow.

By *The Return of the King*, Théoden has become more confident in himself and his people. He boldly declares that Rohan will answer Gondor's call for aid once the Beacons of Minas Tirith are lit, and he assembles an army of 6,000 riders to liberate Gondor from Mordor's armies. Though he does not believe that his men can actually defeat Sauron, he inspires the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor's aid for the sake of honor.

At the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Théoden leads the Rohirrim in their charge against the Orcish armies. The Rohirrim largely defeat the Orcs only to face a greater challenge in Harad's Mûmakil. Théoden's riders appear well on the way to victory when the Witch-king of Angmar arrives and throws Théoden from his steed. The king is crushed beneath his horse, and is about to be eaten by the Witch-king's Nazgûl-bird when Éowyn intervenes. Théoden lives long enough to witness his niece kill the Witch-king before succumbing to his injuries.

In the epilogue, it is implied that Éomer ascends to the throne of Rohan, although earlier in *The Return of the King* film, Théoden had suggested that Éowyn should rule if anything were to happen to him in the battle at Minas Tirith.
