# Oromë

**Oromë** (Quenya:  "Horn-blower"), also known as **Aldaron **(Quenya: "Lord of Forests"), **Araw** (Sindarin), and **Arǭmēz**,** **was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and the Vala responsible for the hunt. He was the brother of Nessa and husband of Vána.

## Biography

During the Years of the Trees, after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in Aman, Oromë still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion. Thus, it was he who discovered the Elves when they first awoke at Cuiviénen and named them the *Eldar.*  Thereafter, he remained close in friendship with them.

A powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against Morgoth. He had a great horn called the Valaróma and a great steed named Nahar.

In legend, Oromë is said to have first created the Rainbow or "Bridge of Heaven" using golden threads of Vána's hair, during the Hiding of Valinor.

## Character
Oromë is described as a mighty lord and a great huntsman, as he would often train his folk and beasts in pursuit of evil creatures. He loved the lands of Middle-earth and was initially unwilling to leave it. He contrasts with the Vala Tulkas in demeanor; whereas Tulkas laughs in sports, Oromë is said to be dreadful in anger.

## Etymology
[[File:OromëByRennavedh.png|thumb|280x280px|Oromë Aldaron, by [https://www.deviantart.com/rennavedh Rennavedh] on DeviantArt]]
***Oromë*** means "Horn-blowing" or "Sound of horns", deriving from the Valarin name **Arômêz**.

***Araw*** is the Sindarin translation of *Oromë*.

### Other names
In the Old English translation of tales by Eriol, Oromë is called **Wadfrea** ("The Huntinglord"), **Huntena frea** ("Lord of Hunters"), and **Wealdafrea** ("Lord of Forests"). Among the Rohirrim and other Northmen, he was also sometimes called **Béma** (Old English, originally *Béaming*; translating *Tauron* "forest-lord").
