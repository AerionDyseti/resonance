# Roäc

**Roäc** was the son of Carc, and "the chief of the great ravens of the Mountain".

## History

By the time of the Battle of Five Armies, Roäc was 153 years old, a descendant of the ravens that remained in Ravenhill, after their allies, the Dwarves, were driven out by the Dragon Smaug. His father Carc had seen Smaug descend on the mountain. Roäc told Thorin and Company, that the Dragon was defeated. He served as a messenger between Thorin, and Dáin II Ironfoot in preparation for the troubles that followed.

## In adaptations
### Radio series

Roäc was voiced by John Wyse in the *The Hobbit* (1968 radio series) and by Pat Franklyn in the *The Hobbit* (1979 radio series).

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

In *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, Roäc is seen but never speaks. When Bard the Bowman comes to the Mountain to make a deal with Thorin, Roäc is seen flying away towards the Iron Hills. He arrives in the midst of a confrontation between the Thorin's Company and the alliance of Mirkwood Elves and Lake-men, perching on the stone wall at the entrance to the Lonely Mountain and simply nodding to Thorin, indicating the arrival of his cousin Dáin.
