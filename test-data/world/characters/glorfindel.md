# Glorfindel

**Glorfindel** was a Noldo and one of the mightiest Elves of Middle-earth. During the First Age, he was the lord of the House of the Golden Flower of Gondolin, and died fighting a Balrog. After his re-embodiment, he was allowed to come back to Middle-earth in the Second Age, acting as an emissary of the Valar, on a similar mission to the Istari who were to come several years later.

## History
### Early history
Glorfindel was born in Valinor sometime during the Years of the Trees. During the Exile of the Noldor, he was of the host of Turgon. Glorfindel himself was reluctant; only for his allegiance and kinship with Turgon did he go, and had no part in the Kinslaying of Alqualondë.

### Life in Gondolin
After the Return of the Noldor to Middle-earth, Glorfindel's history is obscure. As a great follower of Turgon he was appointed chief of the House of the Golden Flower, one of the noble houses of Gondolin. He was dearly loved by all the Gondolindrim.

He followed Turgon who surprisingly came to fight in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. When the war turned against the alliance, Turgon's and Fingon's forces retreated to the Pass of Sirion with Glorfindel and Ecthelion guarding their flanks.

In the year , Morgoth sent a great force against Gondolin, resulting in the complete destruction of the city. The tale of this battle was well detailed in *The Fall of Gondolin'', and long remembered by the elves. Glorfindel managed to escape the Fall of Gondolin with the Exiles, and after crossing Tumladen they reached the Cirith Thoronath, a narrow pass between the mountains. There the survivors were attacked by an ambush of Orcs led by a Balrog. The Eagles came to help them, but Glorfindel fought the Balrog alone upon the pinnacle of a rock. Both died after falling in the abyss, and their duel is sung of by many songs. Thorondor rescued Glorfindel's body, and a cairn was raised, which remained there, covered by grass and yellow flowers, until the world changed.

### Re-embodiment and return to Middle-earth
Glorfindel's spirit passed to the Halls of Waiting, where he waited with the spirits of the other Noldor who had died during their war against Morgoth. But because of Glorfindel's noble actions in life, his reluctance at the Exile, and his furthering of the purposes of the Valar by saving Tuor and Idril, Manwë allowed his re-embodiment after only a short time. Being already an Elda of great corporal and spiritual stature, in his new incarnated life his spiritual power was enhanced by his self-sacrifice. He lived in Valinor for many years in the company of the Eldar and the Maiar, the latter also regarding him as an equal, for he was incarnate. At some point, he became a follower of Olórin, a Maia with special concern for Middle-earth. If he arrived in S.A. 1600, he arrived just after the One Ring had been forged, Barad-dûr built, and Celebrimbor dead or soon to be so. While the Blue Wizards were sent to the east, Glorfindel's mission was to aid Gil-galad and Elrond in the struggle against Sauron. Not much can be said about his deeds and role in the events and struggles of the Westlands before the War of the Ring.

During the War, he was one of the elves dispatched from Rivendell by Elrond to search for the Ring-bearer. Elrond had chosen him partially because Glorfindel did not fear the Ringwraiths, as he had great presence in both the Seen and Unseen worlds. While on his perilous mission the Ringwraiths avoided him; he met five of them, and they fled at his presence. It was Glorfindel indeed who accomplished his mission and found the Ringbearer, Frodo Baggins, and his friend Aragorn with him. Glorfindel put Frodo on his horse, Asfaloth, and upon the approach of the Ringwraiths ordered him to go on. The white horse bore Frodo to safety across the Ford of Bruinen, but Frodo, in a rash act of attempted heroism, turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. Glorfindel, expecting the flood that protected Rivendell to come down and smite the riders, revealed his power to the Riders, and drove them (willingly or not) into the River, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.

After this adventure, he helped bear Frodo to Rivendell, where the wounded Ringbearer was tended to. Glorfindel attended the Council of Elrond, playing an active role in the conversation, speaking prophetically of Tom Bombadil and other matters with authority. Glorfindel stood beside Elrond and Gandalf as the backbone of the Council, laying out clearly their options. At first Glorfindel suggested that the Ring would be safe in the depths of the Sea, but the far-sighted Gandalf noted the change of landscapes, and the unforeseen possibilities that could bring the Ring forth once more in a hundred or even a thousand years in the future. He was briefly considered as a member of the Fellowship of the Ring, but as his friend Gandalf said, Glorfindel's power would be of little use against the might of Mordor, on a mission of secrecy.

During the War of the Ring nothing is said of Glorfindel. Whatever his role, he survived and joined Elrond's company to the Wedding of Elessar. After that no more is said of him. Like Olórin, his task in Middle-earth was done, and the age of the Elves was over. He probably passed into the West, perhaps accompanying the bearers of the Three Rings and the One Ring. Or he may have remained in Middle-earth for some time to oversee the post-war recovery before eventually departing for Valinor.

## Etymology

With the development of the Elvish languages, the name *Glorfindel* had different etymologies, ultimately meaning the same. 

The early Gnomish conception meant "Goldtress" or "Goldlocks". At this stage of the legendarium, Tolkien considered many other variants, like *Glorfinn* or *Glorfing*. Qenya cognates were ***Laurifindl*** or ***Kulufindl***.

At the Noldorin stage, the name was composed of the words *glaur* ("gold") + *findel/finnel* ("braided hair"), but it is not properly glossed.

In the final Sindarin conception, *Glorfindel* meant "Golden-hair", from *glaur* ("gold") + *findel* ("head of hair"). It was supposedly derived from the Quenya form ***Laurefindelë***.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### Early legendarium
#### *The Book of Lost Tales*
The most detailed text about the deeds of Glorfindel during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter "The Fall of Gondolin", in *The Book of Lost Tales Part Two*. There he is described as the chief of the House of the Golden Flower, who bore a rayed sun upon their shields. He wore a mantle embroidered in threads of gold, decorated with celandine "as a field in spring", while his arms were damascened with "cunning gold". 

Glorfindel witnessed the coming of Tuor and later the Fall of Gondolin. During the ensuing battle in the streets, Glorfindel chose (or was ordered) to hold the Great Market from the advancing Orcs. He attempted to flank them, taking the enemy by surprise, but was himself ambushed and surrounded. Cut off, the House of the Golden Flower fought on fiercely for hours, until a fire-breathing dragon came and levelled their ranks. Glorfindel, with some of the strongest of his followers, cut his way out, but the survivors of that battle were very few. Even then they were pursued and might have all been killed, but the House of the Harp arrived in time, after rebelling from their treacherous leader Salgant, ambushing their pursuers. The Golden Flower arrived at the Square of the King, one of the last of the houses to be driven in.

Glorfindel was originally planned to be part of the Fellowship of the Ring, in a way taking the place of Legolas.

### Later legendarium
#### *The War of the Jewels*
While composing the chapter about Maeglin, Tolkien considered Glorfindel, Ecthelion and Egalmoth as the escort of Aredhel when she left the Hidden City in her way to visit Fingon.

#### *Last Writings*
Tolkien first suggested that Glorfindel returned to Middle-earth about , with Gandalf.  He is briefly seen in the film at Aragorn's coronation when Arwen is revealed.

'*2006: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II*:*'
:Glorfindel played an important part in this video game, set during the War of the Ring. Together with Glóin of Erebor, Glorfindel fights in several places in northern Eriador and Rhovanion. He is voiced by Jason Carter, and portrayed as white haired. His design was changed to a more movie-accurate version in the expansion pack, *The Rise of the Witch-king*. He serves as narrator throughout, and appears in the story itself after the death of Arvedui.

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Glorfindel is featured in an extended flashback sequence depicting the War of the Last Alliance. During this time, he is the leader of the Bright Company, a group of High Elves who fighting to rid Middle-earth of Sauron's evil long before that war and who continue their duty long after.
:In the present day, Glorfindel can be found in Rivendell just south of the Last Homely House. He is involved in the campaign against Angmar during the main story and also talks to the player after defeating the balrog Thaurlach. Glorfindel disappears in the final weeks of the War of the Ring and the player tracks him across Middle-Earth to summon him to the Council of Elf-Lords between Thranduil, Celeborn and Galadriel. He joins the procession that escorts Lady Arwen to Minas Tirith for her wedding; along the way Glorfindel and Elrond assist Gandalf and the player in uncovering a mystery within the Gladden Fields.

'*2012: *Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game*:**
:Glorfindel is purchasable as an optional player character in DLC character pack 2 for use in free play and on the open world. He is portrayed with light tan hair (rather than yellow blond like Legolas), wears an outfit which is a mix of light blue robe parts and silver armour whilst wearing a light blue cape. He wields a bow of the Galadhrim and also carries a golden Elvish longsword (all Elvish longswords appear gold in the game). Glorfindel is one of the most proficient fighter characters in the game.

**2022-24: *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*:*'
:According to the showrunners, Glorfindel will make an appearance in a later season of *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*.

#### Collectibles
Gentle Giant produced a *Glorfindel Mini Bust* for Comic-Con 2007, based on Glorfindel's appearance in EA's *The Battle for Middle-earth II*.
