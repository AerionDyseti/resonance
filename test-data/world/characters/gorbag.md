# Gorbag

**Gorbag** was the captain of the Uruks of Minas Morgul. He served the Nazgûl who dwelt in the Dead City.  

## History
During the peak of the War of the Ring, the Silent Watchers exhibited unease because a Hobbit, Frodo Baggins, had passed by them. Gorbag and a patrol then, left Minas Morgul and were sent to Cirith Ungol where Shagrat was in command.

On 13 March  Gorbag and Shagrat came across Frodo, now paralyzed by Shelob. They ordered Frodo carried back into the Tower of Cirith Ungol as their prisoner.  

During their return to the tower Sam, who was wearing the One Ring, overheard them talking. It quickly became apparent that Gorbag was the more observant of the two, and noticed that the paralyzed halfling's cords were cut, meaning that he had a companion: Shagrat said that the Nazgûl were uneasy and that something nearly slipped, and Gorbag corrected him saying that something *had* slipped; Shagrat pointed out that Shelob got the halfling, but Gorbag pointed out that he was not alone, as someone else cut the cords from Frodo. Shagrat dismissed Gorbag's reasoning by claiming that he always took a gloomy view.  Shagrat, who had been in the tower longer, was able to tell Gorbag that Frodo was not dead.
