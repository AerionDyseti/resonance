# Gárulf

**Gárulf** was a Man of Rohan during the War of the Ring.

## History
Gárulf was a rider in the *Éored* of Éomer, Third Marshal of the Riddermark. His *Éored* attacked and slaughtered the Uruk-hai of Uglúk under the eaves of Fangorn Forest, where Gárulf was killed. His horse Hasufel was given to Aragorn by Éomer when they first met in the Wold.

## Etymology
- Gárulf* is Old English for "spear-wolf". It was a name of a jutish warrior in the *Finnsburg Fragment*.
