AI summary: Captain Khabat Holbrar is a dedicated veteran of the Stoneguard, known for her merit-based rise to Captain and her commitment to maintaining professional standards. She resists political interference, treats all individuals with respect, and is recognized for her fairness and transparency in operations. Her tense relationship with Lieutenant Roland Thornhelm-Brightweave highlights her struggle against political pressures, while her leadership includes training new recruits and conducting surprise inspections.

## Background

A veteran of the Stoneguard, Captain Khabat Holbrar earned her position through decades of dedicated service and unwavering integrity. Unlike some of her politically-connected colleagues, she rose through the ranks based purely on merit and leadership ability.

## Position & Authority

As a Captain in the Stoneguard, Holbrar serves as a counterbalance to House Brightweave's influence over the city guard. She maintains strict professional standards and refuses to show favoritism, even when facing pressure from noble houses.

## Personality

- Direct and honest in her dealings with both subordinates and superiors
- Shows equal respect to nobles and commoners alike
- Deeply committed to the original mission of the Stoneguard as protectors of the city
- Frustrated by but resistant to political interference in guard operations

## Appearance

Captain Holbrar wears the standard Stoneguard uniform without embellishment, kept in impeccable condition. Her graying hair is worn in a traditional dwarven style with simple iron clasps, and her weathered skin bears several prominent scara from old injuries sustained in the line of duty. She moves with the measured confidence of a seasoned warrior.

## Relationships

Her professional relationship with Lieutenant Roland Thornhelm-Brightweave is notably tense, as she frequently finds herself having to correct or override his politically motivated decisions. While Lord Marcus Brightweave views her as an obstacle to his family's control over the Stoneguard, her record of service and reputation for fairness make her difficult to remove from her position.

## Notable Characteristics

- Keeps detailed records of all guard operations to ensure transparency
- Personally leads training sessions for new recruits to instill proper values
- Known for conducting surprise inspections of guard posts at all hours
- Maintains a network of trusted informants among the city's common folk
