# Glóin

**Glóin** was a dwarf of Durin's Folk, the son of Gróin, the brother of Óin, and the father of Gimli of the Fellowship of the Ring.  He is most famous as one of Thorin's companions on the quest to Erebor. 77 years after the Quest of Erebor,  Glóin attended the Council of Elrond with his son Gimli, where the latter would represent dwarves in the Fellowship of the Ring

## History
Glóin was likely born in Dunland, where the Dwarves of Durin's Line dwelt in exile  Glóin was present at the Battle of Azanulbizar,

Glóin was the fifth Dwarf in the fourth group to arrive at Bag End for the Unexpected Party, and he came wearing a white hood.  Glóin did not assist in setting the table nor did he bring a musical instrument out when Thorin called for music.  After Bilbo had his fit of fright he overheard Glóin sneer that the hobbit looked "more like a grocer than a burglar" when he saw him "bobbing and puffing on the mat".  This affronted Bilbo enough to make him agree to undertake the quest.  Then, when Gandalf proclaimed that Bilbo was his choice he scowled at Glóin so fiercely that the dwarf huddled back in his chair, and later glaring at Bilbo.

On their quest Glóin was quite useful, especially at making fires, although on the night the company met the trolls, William, Bert, and Tom, he and his brother failed to start one and began to fight, yet though first they quarreled.  On the night when the company came to the glade of the Wargs, Glóin along with his brother, Dori, Nori and Ori secured a seat in a huge pine tree.  At Beorn's home Glóin and Óin were the fifth pair of Dwarves to appear as Gandalf spun their tale.  And when released from his barrel near Esgaroth, Glóin was one of the Dwarves who was waterlogged and seemed but half alive, and needed to be carried ashore.

Glóin fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies.  He was given his share of the treasure by Dáin Ironfoot, who became King after Thorin's death. Glóin settled in the Lonely Mountain, along with the survivors of the battle, and would grow wealthy in Erebor under the leadership of King Dáin.

### War of the Ring
In October  Glóin and his son Gimli were sent by Dáin Ironfoot to Rivendell to seek advice concerning the fate of Balin's Colony in Moria.  When Frodo Baggins recovered from his wounds and attended the feast, it was Glóin who sat next to him and gave him the news from Erebor and surrounding lands since the time of Bilbo.  Later, at the Council of Elrond, Glóin spoke of the shadow that had fallen upon his people, Balin's expedition and of the sinister messenger from Mordor who had come to inquire about Hobbits and where they dwelt. Glóin's greatest contribution to the War of the Ring was his son Gimli, who joined the Fellowship of the Ring.

It is possible that Glóin fought in the Battle of Dale against the Easterlings during the War of the Ring, for he lived until .

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In both the early manuscript of *The Hobbit* and in the published version, Glóin had heard of Bilbo's great-great-great-grand-uncle Bullroarer Took, who accidentally invented the game of Golf.  However, only in the early manuscript it was mentioned that Glóin was very fond of golf.

In *The Fellowship of the Ring*, the dwarf Burin (also Frár), being Balin's son (from Thorin and Company) was suppose to accompany Glóin to the Council of Elrond, and that would later join The Fellowship of the Ring, though it was changed to Gimli, and also changed to be Glóin's son, in the final draft of the novel.
