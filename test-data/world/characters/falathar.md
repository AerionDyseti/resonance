# Falathar

**Falathar** was a faithful friend of Eärendil, and one of the three mariners who accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of Middle-earth.

## Biography

Like Eärendil's other two companions, Falathar's origins were not known, but he most likely lived in Arvernien in the Havens of Sirion.

When Eärendil was resolved to sail to Aman to plea for help from the Valar, Falathar, along with Aerandir and Erellont, went with him. Upon their eventual arrival to the Blessed Realm, he and others remained aboard while Eärendil sought the Valar. After Eärendil's embassy was complete, Eönwë, the herald of Manwë, came to him and the others and set them upon another ship, and then Manwë set a great wind to blow them east back to Middle-earth.

His fate afterwards is untold.

## Etymology

- Falathar* was a Sindarin word for 'coast', from the common term *falas*.
