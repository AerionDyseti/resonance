# Samwise Gamgee

150px

**Samwise Gamgee**, known also as **Samwise Gardner** or simply as **Sam**, was a hobbit of the Shire. He was Frodo Baggins' gardener and best friend. Sam proved himself to be Frodo's closest and most dependable companion, the most loyal of the Fellowship of the Ring, and played a critical role in protecting Frodo and destroying the One Ring.

## Biography

### Early life

Sam was the youngest son of Hamfast and Bell Gamgee, being bird un TA 2980 (SR 1380). He had many brothers and sisters. A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple Hobbit of plain speech. However, his love for Elves, his gift for poetry, and his belief that the world contained greater wonders than most hobbits were aware of (all nurtured by his tutor Bilbo Baggins) set him apart from the beginning. It was Sam who first introduced (in J.R.R. Tolkien's novels) the theme of the Elves sailing from Middle-earth, a subtle foreshadowing of Bilbo and Frodo's final journey across the sea from the Grey Havens. He lived with his father, Hamfast Gamgee, known commonly as "The Gaffer", on Bagshot Row in the Shire, close to Bag End. He had five siblings: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, and Marigold.

### Quest of the Ring
As "punishment" for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo regarding the dangers of the One Ring while trimming the grass of Bag End, Gandalf chose Sam to be Frodo's companion on his journey to Rivendell. Sam saved Frodo's life more than once during the quest to destroy the Ring, and would accompany him all the way to Mount Doom.

After leaving Bree, Sam became very close to the pony Bill. On arrival at the Doors of Durin Bill had to be set loose as he could not pass through the Mines of Moria. This caused Sam great distress. In Lothlórien Sam was given a gift by the Lady Galadriel; a small box containing soil from her garden along with a Mallorn seed.

On February 26, TA 3019, The Fellowship was officially separated, with Sam going with Frodo. Within a week, they were attacked by Gollum, who wanted to take back the Ring, but he was subdued by both. Against Sam's wishes who distrusted Gollum, Frodo had Gollum guide them to the Black Gate.

Gollum later led them into Shelob's Lair and then disappeared as part of his plan to get the Ring, causing the two to realize that he betrayed them. After Shelob started chasing Frodo, Sam was ambushed by Gollum, who attacked him. Sam, however, defeated Gollum, causing the latter to flee. Sam then found Frodo lying on the ground and came to the conclusion that Shelob killed him. After fighting off Shelob, Sam took the Ring and intended to complete the quest on his own. Because he held the Ring for a time, he was considered one of the Ring-bearers. During the time he possessed it, the Ring tempted him with visions of a great garden all for himself. Being humble, Sam never gave into the treacherous visions and temptations of the Ring, and returned it when he discovered Frodo alive in the Tower of Cirith Ungol. He and Bilbo were the only ones ever to have given up the Ring willingly, and only Sam surrendered it readily.

When Orcs took Frodo's body, Sam overheard one of them saying that Frodo was still alive, so he followed them into the Tower of Cirith Ungol, determined to rescue Frodo. Once there he found that competing bands of Uruks and Morgul Orcs had rioted and killed one another over the possession of Frodo's Mithril Coat, thus making it easier for Sam to get to Frodo and escape the tower with him.

Sam and Frodo made their way to Mount Doom, disguised as Orcs along the way. The way to Mount Doom was filled with fiery rocks and pillows of ash which made it almost impossible for the hobbits to pass. When Frodo collapsed from weakness, Sam carried him up the slopes of Mount Doom, only to be stopped by Gollum. Sam delayed Gollum while Frodo continued towards the Cracks of Doom. He was about to attack him, but when Gollum begged him not to hurt him, Sam, decided to let him go out of pity, as his brief time with the Ring made him understand what it was like to be tempted, and as such, he probably somewhat understood Gollum. 

Sam then rushed to follow Frodo, only to see Frodo renounce the quest and claim the Ring as his own, putting it on his finger. Unbeknownst to Sam, Gollum had followed in his tracks, and attacked him from behind. In the moments while Sam was dazed, Gollum attacked Frodo, and after a brief struggle took the Ring by force by biting off Frodo's finger. Gollum began to celebrate regaining the Ring, but in doing so slipped and fell to his death in the fiery chasm below, destroying the Ring in the process.
The destruction of the Ring triggered a violent upheaval of Mount Doom, but with Sam's assistance, the two hobbits escaped from Sammath Naur onto the mountainside. Though they attempted to descend, the hobbits were trapped by the issue of lava and fiery ash from the mountain. Before the fire reached them, however, Gwaihir the Lord of the Great Eagles, come at the behest of Gandalf, spotted the hobbits from afar. Landroval and Meneldor, Gwaihir's companions, rescued Sam and Frodo and flew them to the safety of Ithilien.

Sam and Frodo were healed of their wounds, while still unconscious, by Aragorn upon reaching Ithilien. Sam awoke, to his surprise, to find Gandalf watching over him. Gandalf led Sam and Frodo to the Field of Cormallen, where they were met by a large crowd, who praised the hobbits in many tongues for their heroism and sacrifice. There they met also Aragorn, who revealed himself to the hobbits as the true King of Gondor and Arnor. In the following days, Frodo and Sam were reunited with the surviving members of the Fellowship, and at length, those assembled traveled to Minas Tirith for Aragorn's coronation. Upon reaching their native country, however, they found it to be usurped by Ruffians and unfriendly hobbits under the rule of Lotho Sackville-Baggins, who had begun the process of turning the Shire into an industrial center. Sam, Frodo, Merry, and Pippin played an instrumental role in what afterwards became known as the Scouring of the Shire, in which the Shire was freed from its ruinous occupation by Ruffians. It was also discovered that Lotho was in fact a puppet of Saruman, who had come north to play his last bit of mischief. Both met their demise in the events prior to and following the Battle of Bywater.      

### After the War of the Ring

Following the Scouring of the Shire, Sam married Rose (Rosie) Cotton. They had thirteen children: Elanor the Fair, Frodo, Rose, Merry, Pippin, Goldilocks, Hamfast, Daisy, Primrose, Bilbo, Ruby, Robin, and Tolman. When Frodo Baggins announced that he was leaving to the Undying Lands, west of Middle-earth, he gave Sam the Red Book of Westmarch and Bag End where he and his large personal family, later called the Gardners, would live for many years. After Will Whitfoot resigned his post as Mayor of Michel Delving, in SR 1427, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive seven-year terms.

### Later years
After his wife died in the year 61 of the Fourth Age (SR 1482), Sam, at the age of 102, entrusted the Red Book to his daughter, Elanor, and left the Shire. It was a tradition handed down from Elanor that he went to the Grey Havens, and because he was also a Ring-bearer, he was allowed to pass over the Sea to be reunited with Frodo in the Undying Lands.

## Etymology
J.R.R. Tolkien took the name from , a surgical dressing invented by a   surgeon called . "Gamgee" became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool; Tolkien described why he had chosen that name for his character:

It is possible that Tolkien may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Gamgee (who died in 1886, but is commemorated by a plaque at the , only yards from Tolkien's childhood home), but he claimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in  but had not read the book. Tolkien replied on March 18:

He proceeded to send Mr. Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in Tolkien's mind, as he recorded in his journal:

In Appendix F of *The Lord of the Rings*, Tolkien states that the Westron form of Sam's name is **Banazîr Galbasi** (*also spelled Galpsi*). *Banazîr* comes from elements meaning "halfwise" or "simple"; Tolkien replaced it with *Samwise,* a modernization of the ancient English *samwís* which corresponds closely in meaning. *Galbasi* comes from the name of the village *Galabas*. The name *Galabas* uses the elements *galab-*, meaning "game", and *bas-*, corresponding somewhat to "-wich" or "-wick". Tolkien's English translation, *Samwís Gamwich*, could have come to *Samwise Gamgee* in modern English. Sam is also known as Perhael in Sindarin.

## Commentary

Many regard Sam Gamgee as the "true hero" of *The Lord of the Rings*. Tolkien himself expressed this view in one of his letters, referring to him as the "chief hero", with special emphasis placed on Sam's "rustic love" for Rosie. The quest to destroy the Ring would have failed without Sam, who repeatedly saves Frodo from disaster (rescuing him at Cirith Ungol and carrying him up Mount Doom).

The relationship between Frodo and Sam was, in many respects, at the centre of *The Lord of the Rings*. To the modern reader, it seems archaic - it is clearly extremely class-oriented: Sam's humbleness and "plain speaking" is frequently emphasized in contrast to Frodo's "gentility", and he often shows deference to Frodo, calling him "Mister Frodo". At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between them, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Cirith Ungol, where Sam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with Frodo in death.

Tolkienologists regard Sam as Frodo's batman. In the , a batman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer. It was a role with which Tolkien (who served as an Army officer in the First World War) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all of the typical roles of a batman - he runs errands for Frodo, he cooks, he transports him (or at least carries him), and he carries his luggage. Tolkien confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter that:

Compare with the relationship between  and his squire , and the gradual "Quixotization" of Sancho. Jim Butcher also describes Samwise in his book *Changes:*

## Portrayals in adaptations

### In 1978 and 1980 animated adaptations
 voiced the character of Samwise Gamgee in the 1980 animated short of , made directly for television. In , originally released in 1978, Michael Scholes voiced the character.

### In *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy

In the Peter Jackson movies  (2001),  (2002) and  (2003), Sam was played by Sean Astin. It is not clear whether Astin had heard Nighy's radio performance, but both actors bring very similar characterizations and accents to the role.

In *The Two Towers*, Faramir brings Frodo, Sam and Gollum into Osgiliath where an ongoing war is occurring with the forces of Minas Morgul. During the chaos of the winged Nazgûl's arrival, Faramir leaves Frodo's side to assist the defenders, and Frodo is uncontrollably lured by the proximity of The Witch-king of Angmar at one of the bridges of the city. He walks to the bridge, and the Ringwraith arises before Frodo on his Fellbeast. Frodo, in a trance, starts extending the One Ring to him, until Sam intervenes and rescues him, and Faramir repels the Fellbeast. Sam gives Frodo extended encouragement after the battle subsides. 

Later, as Sam and Frodo walk away from Osgiliath on the other side of the river, after Faramir has freed them, Sam wonders whether he and Frodo would ever be mentioned in songs and stories, pondering how future Hobbits would want to hear about Frodo and his journey to Mordor. Frodo replies that they "would want to hear more about *Samwise the Brave",* as Frodo "wouldn't have gotten far without Sam".  

Then, in *The Return of the King*, Sam and Frodo keep on their journey to Mordor, where Gollum schemes to divide Sam and Frodo so that he can more easily reclaim the One Ring. Sam has suspected Gollum and his devious ways from the beginning, ready to oppose Gollum's plans as their guide to protect Frodo, being firmly loyal to him.   

On the steep stairways toward Cirith Ungol, Sam and Gollum's mutual hate and distrust escalate, and, while the Hobbits sleep, Gollum deceitfully frames Sam of consuming the last of their lembas bread. Frodo is deceived of this when he awakes, believing also Gollum's lie that Sam desires the Ring for himself, and thus derides Sam angrily and abandons him, proceeding up the stairs with Gollum. Sam is heartbroken, and while descending the stairs in despair, finds the lembas bread that Gollum had tossed at night, realizing his deception and betrayal. He finds the courage to turn around, ascend the stairs after them, and try to find and aid Frodo.  

After Frodo is forsaken by Gollum in Shelob's lair, Shelob stuns and entangles him in her webs, immediately before Sam arrives, bearing the Phial of Galadriel. He heroically contests with the giant spider, and battles her with the piercing Elvish light and Frodo's sword, Sting. After driving Shelob away, Orcs from the Tower of Cirith Ungol come to the cave and find Frodo's body. They carry it away to the Tower, and Sam follows them, soon rescuing Frodo from being killed by Gorbag after the Orcs have slaughtered each other over Frodo's mithril coat. Frodo repents of having rejected Sam, and the two press on toward Mount Doom, without food or water. While they walk up the desolate slopes of the mountain, Frodo's burden of the One Ring intensifies extremely, and he collapses, but Sam musters all his strength, and carries Frodo on his back.   

Sam saves Frodo from death again, by helping resist Gollum's last, vicious attempt to kill Frodo and reclaim the Ring at the Sammath Naur. As Frodo falls from the precipice within Mount Doom with Gollum, Sam helps Frodo back up as Gollum falls to his death with the Ring.  

Weeks later, after the coronation of Aragorn, Sam bids Frodo a difficult, fond farewell at the Grey Havens before Frodo and others depart for the Undying Lands. Sam returns to the Shire, and *The Return of the King* ends with his last words: "I'm back."
