# Galdor

**Galdor** was a man of Dor-lómin of the House of Hador (Third House of the Edain) during the First Age.

## Biography
Galdor was the second child and elder son of Hador Lórindol and succeeded his father as Lord of Dor-lómin, the sixth Chieftain of the House of Hador (or House of Marach) and Captain of Eithel Sirion. He married Hareth of the Haladin and had two sons - the elder son was Húrin and the younger son was Huor. Galdor had a younger brother named Gundor and an older sister, Glóredhel.

Galdor was noted for his exceptional height, even among the Edain, and was thus called **Galdor the Tall**. He led the people of Hador during the peak of their power, before the Dagor Bragollach. He was slain by an arrow seven years after that battle, when the Barad Eithel was besieged by Morgoth's armies.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier accounts Indor was the son of Fengel, the father of Peleg and grandfather of Tuor. However, later was replaced by Galdor.
