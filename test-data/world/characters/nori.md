# Nori

**Nori** was a Dwarf of Durin's Folk. He had a brother named Dori as well as a cousin named Ori, and was a remote kinsman of Thorin Oakenshield.

He played the flute, and was very fond of regular and plentiful meals like his Hobbit friend, Bilbo Baggins.

## Biography
### Early life
Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

### Quest of Erebor
In TA 2941, Nori, along with Dori and Ori, became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure in the Lonely Mountain. After their experience in Goblin-town when the company was pursued by Wargs and Orcs and forced to climb up into some trees, Nori was the first realize that Bilbo had been left on the ground and pointed him out to his brother Dori who rescued Bilbo.

Nori did little to distinguish himself during the Dwarves's adventures in the wild, though he shared the same array of experiences as the others of the Company: captured in turn by Trolls, Goblins, Spiders, and Elves, they eventually reached the distant Lonely Mountain and recovered it for Durin's Folk.

Nori fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies and returned to the Lonely Mountain where he established himself and grew rich. During the War of the Ring, Nori was still living in the Lonely Mountain, and possibly fought in the Battle of Dale against the Easterlings.

The studio released the following description of Nori in the films:

''"Perhaps the most elusive member of The Company of Thorin Oakenshield, Nori is often in trouble with the Dwarvish authorities. Deciding it might be a good time to leave town, he readily joins the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, not realizing the journey ahead may well lead him into far more trouble than he has left behind. Nobody ever quite knows what the quick-witted and wily Nori is up to, except that it's guaranteed to be dodgy and quite possibly illegal. Despite rarely seeing eye-to-eye with his brothers Dori and Ori, he is nonetheless immensely loyal and will protect them by whatever means possible."*

In , Nori lives in Erebor during and after the War of the Ring, holding the position of the Keeper of the Coffers. He is first found in the Gatehouse of the Lonely Mountain, where he and his brother Dori brief the player on breaking the Siege of Erebor. After the battle, Nori and the other surviving Dwarves of the Company join Dís in paying respect to tomb of Thorin Oakenshield. Under the illusion that after the downfall of Sauron great wealth could now be reclaimed from the ancient dwarf-holds left to ruin in the Ered Mithrin, Nori breaks the direct edict of King Thorin Stonehelm and in secret leads a small expedition to reclaim the wealth of the Longbeards in Thikil-gundu, "The Steel Keep". His brother Dori forms a small band of Dwarves to rescue him from his folly, including his old companions Bofur and Glóin, and together with the player search for Nori's trail across the Ered Mithrin. They eventually find him in the Steel Keep, by which time Nori had realized the error of his thinking, as the demise of Sauron did nothing to evil creatures that have since long made the Longbeard halls their home. The Dwarves then set out for the journey back to Erebor with the exception of Glóin, who continues the adventure alongside the player.
