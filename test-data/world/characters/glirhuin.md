# Glirhuin

**Glirhuin** was an Edain of the Men of Brethil during the late First Age.

## Biography
Glirhuin was a seer and a harp-player of the Haladin who lived in the Forest of Brethil around the year FA 499.

Beginning after Húrin's stay among the Haladin in the year 501, Men no longer feared to approach the Talbor. Until the War of Wrath, the women of the Haladin would bring flowers and berries to the stone in spring and autumn respectively, singing of the Grey Lady who sought her son. It was during this time that Glirhuin once composed a song prophesying that the Stone of the Hapless would never be defiled by Morgoth, and instead would remain standing ever after, no matter what would happen to the land and seas. Glirhuin's prediction turned out to be true, as the stone continued to stand on the isle of Tol Morwen after the War of Wrath.. It was noted by Mark Fisher on the Encyclopedia of Arda that the second element, *huin*, has a multitude of meanings, listing "hearts" as an example of one. Fisher also suggests that the second element could be connected to *hô* ("speak") as in *huorn*,.
