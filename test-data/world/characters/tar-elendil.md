# Tar-Elendil

**Tar-Elendil** was the fourth King of Númenor, succeeding his father Tar-Amandil. He was considered to be a master of lore and a notable scholar.
## Biography

His oldest child was Silmariën, a daughter, and his second child was Isilmë, another daughter. Silmariën would have become Queen according to the principle of "full cognatic primogeniture". However, the laws dictating succession at the time followed rather the principle known as "agnatic primogeniture", preventing women from ruling. Consequently, his third child and oldest son, Tar-Meneldur succeeded him.
