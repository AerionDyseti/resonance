## Background

Abner Kassem served as a Templar in the Solaaran Empire, where his position in the clergy's military arm and devotion to the sun god made him a zealous enforcer of imperial order. His life changed forever during a routine mission when he discovered that one of his targets—a woman suspected of vampire associations—was protecting her half-vampire child. In a moment that would haunt him eternally, Abner slew the woman before learning the full truth. Upon finding her young daughter, Callidora, he was overcome with remorse and chose to raise her as his own instead of completing his mission.

After leaving the Templars to join the less militant clergy, Abner devoted himself to protecting Callidora. He used his knowledge and connections to shield her from those who might persecute her for her dhampir heritage. This pivotal decision led them down an unexpected path—Callidora would later emerge as one of the three remaining Dragonmarked, bearing the Mark of Xenirith.

His recent experiences with the Dragonmarked have shaken the foundations of his religious convictions. Witnessing the true nature of divinity and the afterlife through Callidora's cosmological adventures has forced him to question everything he once preached as absolute truth. This crisis of faith has deepened his journey of redemption as he struggles to reconcile his past zealotry with these new revelations about the universe.

## Personality

Once driven by religious fervor, Abner's experiences have transformed his zealotry into thoughtful wisdom. He carries himself with quiet dignity, though the burden of his past weighs visibly on his bearing. Rather than religious doctrine, he now offers practical guidance and shows deep compassion for those grappling with moral dilemmas.

## Appearance

A man in his later years, Abner maintains a dignified bearing that speaks to his clerical background. His weathered features and graying hair tell of years spent in vigilant protection of his adopted daughter.
