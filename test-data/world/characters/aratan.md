# Aratan

**Aratan** was the second son of Isildur, and a brother of Valandil.

## Biography

Aratan did not take part in the invasion of Mordor or the Siege of Barad-dûr. Instead, his father sent he and his brother Ciryon to Minas Ithil with a force in case Sauron should break or escape the siege through Cirith Dúath, and assail the Dúnedain before he was yet defeated. He like his brothers Elendur and Ciryon, were slain at the Gladden Fields.

## Etymology

The name ***Aratan*** is a Quenya word that translates into the Common Speech as "Royal Man". Its second element *atan* is the root of *Atani*, the ancient Quenya word for mankind.

## Portrayals in adaptations
In , the three elder sons of Isildur appear in an extended flashback set during the Siege of Barad-dûr in the year S.A. 3440. However, because the game's license does not cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Aratan uses the name "Ornaher" as his alias.

## Earlier versions of the legendarium

The forerunning name for the character Aratan was *Eärnur*.
