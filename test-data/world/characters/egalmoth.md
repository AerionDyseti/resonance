# Egalmoth

**Egalmoth** was a Gnome-lord of Gondolin according to the early version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*.

## History
He was the leader of the folk of the Heavenly Arch. He wore a blue mantle upon which stars were embroidered in crystal, and his sword was bent (none of the other Noldoli carried curved swords). However, he trusted more to his bow, for he could shoot further than anyone of his folk.

When the Fall of Gondolin began, a great part of his folk was in the walls of the northern gate, where the main attack happened.

## Etymology
- Egalmoth* is Gnomish for "Broadshoulder", and its Qenya form is ***Aikaldamor***.

In the *Name-list to The Fall of Gondolin*, the following definition is provided:
- "Egalmoth is a great name, yet none know clearly its meaning - some have said its bearer was so named in that he was worth a thousand elves (but Rumil says nay) and others that it signifies the mighty shoulders of that Gnome, and so saith Rumil, but perchance it was woven of a secret tongue of the Gondothlim, yet was he lord of the house of the Heavenly Arch, and got even out of the burning of Gondolin, and dwelt after at the mouth of Sirion, but was slain in a dire battle there when Melko seized Elwing."* The "thousand" is from the Gnomish word **moth**, which had a definition of ''"moth(in), mothwen 1000. probably = flock. [<< 'moth 1000. mothwen (same.)' Cf. I 270 Uin, II 338 Egalmoth.]"*

When Tolkien developed Sindarin, *Egalmoth* became an obsolete name, but he had already used it for a steward of Gondor in a published work and the name sounded good, so he retained it in later versions as an archaic form. The proper Sindarin name would be ***Ægamloth***, which means "Pointed helm-crest", from *aeg* ("point") + *amloth* ("uprising flower, implying a crest on a helmet").

## Other versions of the legendarium
### *The Book of Lost Tales*
In an outline of the last Lost Tale, Tolkien considered that Egalmoth and Galdor led the Noldoli back to Valinor.

### *The War of the Jewels''
Egalmoth does not appear again in any later texts of the legendarium, except in one concerning Aredhel's escort. While writing the story of Maeglin in 1951, Tolkien named him as one of the escorts King Turgon sent to accompany Aredhel on her way out of the Hidden City to her brother Fingon, along with Glorfindel and Ecthelion.
