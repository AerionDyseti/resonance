# Dwalin

**Dwalin** was one of the Dwarves who traveled with Bilbo and Gandalf as a member of Thorin and Company on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain from the Dragon Smaug. He was the brother of Balin and the youngest son of Fundin.

## Biography
### Early life
Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin to inform him the news.

### Quest of Erebor
Dwalin was the first Dwarf to arrive, alone, at Bag End when the unexpected party planned by Thorin and Gandalf began at Bilbo Baggins' hobbit hole. Wearing a dark-green hood and a golden belt, he walked into Bilbo's home as if expected, which greatly surprised Bilbo. Soon Balin arrived, and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first (followed by Fíli and Kíli) to lend a hand. Later still, when the Dwarves filled Bag End with music, Dwalin played on a viol as big as himself.

## In adaptations

### In Rankin/Bass films
In the 1977 Rankin/Bass animated version of , Dwalin was voiced by Jack DeLeon, though he only had one line at the Side-door of Lonely Mountain, saying to Thorin "Well, what now?". It is unknown whether he survived the Battle of Five Armies.

### In *The Hobbit* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's  (2012 - 2014), he was portrayed by Scottish actor Graham McTavish. The studio released the following statement regarding Dwalin in the trilogy:

''Renowned as a great warrior, Dwalin speaks his mind plainly and is not one to suffer fools lightly. Fiercely loyal, he was Thorin Oakenshield's staunchest supporter with an unshakeable belief in his friend's leadership. A powerful and bruising fighter, Dwalin has a natural tendency to distrust anyone who is not a Dwarf and is particularly suspicious of Elves. Proud, brave and one of the tallest of the Dwarves, Dwalin will bow to none but those who have earned his respect.''

A younger Dwalin (with a mohawk) is shown in  fighting alongside Thorin at the Battle of Azanulbizar, dueling a Gundabad captain.

During the events of , Dwalin's weapons are stripped from him after being captured by the Wood-elves of Mirkwood. Following the company's escape and their encounter with Bard the Bowman, Dwalin openly voices his mistrust of Bard; suggesting that they throw him overboard and take his boat by force. He later equips himself with a large two-handed mace from Lake-town's armory for the raid on the Lonely Mountain.

In , Dwalin, along with the other dwarves, follow Thorin as they barricade themselves inside Erebor. After Dain's army arrives and begins to fight Azog's huge Orc army, Thorin refuses to aid his cousin. Dwalin tries to persuade Thorin to aid them, saying that Thorin is less of a man than he has even been. Dwalin then follows Thorin, Fili, and Kili to Ravenhill to fight Azog. He witnesses Fili's death, and later comes to Bilbo's aid and fights off the Orcs. Dwalin then bows to Thorin's body after the battle. He is last seen with the rest of the company saying farewell to Bilbo.

Each of *The Hobbit* films' actors had a voice in the nature and design of their own weaponry. Graham McTavish, who plays Dwalin, named the Dwarf's twin battle axes *Grasper* and *Keeper*; when first shooting tests for Dwalin, McTavish said, "This one grasps your soul, this one keeps it" in regard to the axes.

### In video games
In , after Thorin's death, Gormr Doursmith took over Thorin's Halls' leadership but with his consequent defeat at the hands of Dwalin, Dwalin became Lord of the Longbeards in the Blue Mountains and Steward of Thorin's Halls. Before the War of the Ring, he led an expedition to Dourhands' territory, south of the city. Some members of his party fell ill to a strange disease, but were cured later by a fellow Longbeard who had discovered a cure at Dwalin's request. Eventually he discovered the source and stopped it, however he failed to prevent the resurrection of Skorgrim, the ancient King of the Dourhands. Under his leadership, the Longbeards recovered the region from the Dourhands. Dwalin says that he tries to rule the Halls as well as Thorin would in his tribute. He claims he hasn't seen his brother Balin for a while and also that he misses the Lonely Mountain.

In , Dwalin can use his hammer to push large Legos.

## Behind the scenes
J.R.R. Tolkien borrowed the name from Dvalinn, a Dwarf from Norse mythology.

Contrary to belief among fans, nothing about Dwalin's life after the Quest of Erebor, save his date of death and the fact he continued to reside in the Lonely Mountain, is cited in any of Tolkien's works. Whether or not he had children is merely speculation, as none are listed for him in Gimli's genealogy.
