# Arwen

**Arwen Undómiel**, often called **Arwen Evenstar**, was one of the half-elven, married to Aragorn II. She was the daughter of Elrond and Celebrían. From her mother she inherited the Elfstone. As one of the half-elven, she shared the right of her father to choose her fate. She lived most of her life in Imladris, or in Lothlórien with her grandparents. It was in  when she returned from Lothlórien to Rivendell when she met a young foster-son of her father, Aragorn. The young Dúnadan fell in love when he first saw her, though as he was still a youth, Arwen did not return his love. This giving held the function of a wedding gift from the family of the bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.

Arwen wove the standard of Elendil for Aragorn from black cloth, decorating it with mithril, gems and gold. She sent the banner with her brothers and a group of Rangers of the North to Aragorn before he took the Paths of the Dead, thereby inspiring him to take the difficult path. The banner was unfurled at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to triumphantly announce the King's return.

After the defeat of Sauron, Aragorn was crowned as King of the West and the new Reunited Kingdom; on that day Arwen and her father departed for Minas Tirith. On 20 May they reached Lothlórien where they stayed for a week before Arwen resumed with her escort. On 14 June she met her brothers and together they went to Edoras where they stayed two days before continuing to Gondor. 
### Queen
Arwen arrived to Minas Tirith on 1 Lithe and wed Aragorn on Mid-year's Day,

As Queen of Gondor, Arwen maintained a close connection with Gondor's allies, as did her husband. In  they visited the Hobbits outside the Shire and she took as a maid of honour Elanor Gardner, daughter of Samwise Gamgee. She was mother of one son, Eldarion, and at least two unnamed daughters. After Aragorn's death, Arwen departed from Minas Tirith and returned to the abandoned Lothlórien. There she stayed for a time until she gave up her life in  at Cerin Amroth, and was buried there. Tolkien remarked that it also means "greatly blessed" in Welsh.

The Quenya form of her name is not entirely certain, but in his Quenya greeting, Aragorn refers to her again as "Arwen" (*Arwen vanimelda, namárië!*).

## Genealogy
Arwen was a very distant cousin of Aragorn. By their marriage, the long-sundered lines of the Half-elven were joined. Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the kings of the three kindreds of the High Elves as well as the only line with Maia blood through Arwen's great-great grandmother, Melian.

## Other versions of the legendarium
While writing the drafts of *The Lord of the Rings* the character was named *Finduilas*; only during the final proofreading in 1949 Tolkien changed the name to *Arwen*.

Tolkien considered to postpone the birth of Arwen from  to  , or even in , to increase the interval between the birth of the twins and the birth of Arwen where the parents were at rest, and he assigned the error in dates to a "probable scribal origin" (with the inversion of numbers 241/421).

'*1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:Arwen does not appear in this film.

**1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):**
:Arwen is voiced by Sonia Fraser.

**2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):**
:Arwen appears in Rivendell after the Council of Elrond. She has a brief dialogue with Aragorn, and recites several lines from the Riddle of Strider. No voice actress is specified, but it is likely Kath Soucie.

**2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series):*'
:Arwen is played by Liv Tyler. Various additional scenes pertaining to Arwen are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem to be inspired by *The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen*.

:In the first film, she rescues Frodo Baggins from the Black Riders at Bruinen, thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was Glorfindel who put Frodo on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Black Riders, and Elrond and Gandalf arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Frodo defends himself against the Black Riders, whereas in the movie Arwen defends him.  Arwen wields the sword Hadhafang,a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father.

:There is a scene in which Aragorn has a dream about Arwen in which they kiss, a scene where Arwen has an argument with her father about leaving for Valinor, and a scene where she actually departs for Valinor and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion.

:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick, seemingly as a result of her forsaking her immortality. Elrond takes the reforged Narsil, now Andúril, to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with the One Ring, and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. It is possible that Elrond's comments of her dying is simply a metaphor of her becoming mortal, and that he is not implying she has a connection with the Ring, but that Arwen's decision to stay means that her future, like the other free peoples of Middle-earth, now rests on the destruction of the ring. Later, after the Ring is destroyed, Arwen is present at Aragorn's coronation without any signs of illness.

'*2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Arwen is provided by Slávka Halčáková. She only appears in person in the third series (season) of the adaptation, during the events of *The Return of the King*, but is alluded to earlier.

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Arwen can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from Rivendell into the Misty Mountains. Her roles in the game was initially small, and her only significant interaction with the player was the passing of Elessar's banner that she made for Aragorn and bid the player to deliver to Halbarad. After the downfall of Sauron, her prominence increases as Elrond and his household travel to Minas Tirith for her wedding. On their way towards Lothlórien from the lands of the Beornings, Arwen asks her father to visit the cave in which her mother Celebrian was tormented by orcs before being rescued. She later discusses that experience with Lady Galadriel.

'*2011: *The Lord of the Rings: War in the North*:*'
:Arwen resides in Rivendell, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While sporting the appearance of Liv Tyler, her role is closer to the book than that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company with the banner she had made for Aragorn, an event omitted from the movie adaptation. She is voiced by Courtenay Taylor.
