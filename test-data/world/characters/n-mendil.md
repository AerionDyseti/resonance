# Númendil

**Númendil** was the father of Amandil and grandson of Eärendur of Andúnië, the fifteenth Lord of Andúnië. 

## Biography

He came to the throne after his father (whose name is unknown) and became the seventeenth Lord of Andúnië. By the time when Tar-Palantir was King of Númenor, both Lord and King desired a return to the old traditions of Númenor, and they were close friends and political allies. Tar-Palantir would at times travel to see Númendil in Andúnië, and as a Councillor of the Sceptre, Númendil would often journey to the King's seat at Armenelos.

Númendil's son Amandil inherited the Lordship of Andúnië, and through him, Númendil would become the ancestor of all Kings of the Dúnedain in Middle-earth. 

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier versions of J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium, Númendil was intended to have a second son, Elentir. This notion, however, was eventually abandoned.
