# Celegorm

**Celegorm** was a Noldorin prince and one of the seven sons of Fëanor.  Along with all the other sons of Fëanor, he swore the Oath of Fëanor, joined the exile of the Noldor, and settled in East Beleriand.  

Celegorm was a great huntsman, and was a friend of the Vala Oromë. From Oromë he learned great skill of birds and beasts, and could understand a number of their languages. He was further given by Oromë the great hound Huan.

Celegorm was almost always in the company of his brother Curufin, and the pair are most notable for their role as antagonists in the story *Of Beren and Lúthien* where they attempted to usurp the kingdom of Nargothrond, and to force Lúthien into marriage to coerce a political alliance with the kingdom of Doriath. 

Their misdeeds resulted in weakening the Union of Maedhros, which contributed to the disastrous outcome of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. They were eventually killed when the sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath in an effort to claim the Silmaril held there.

## History
### Early life and exile

Celegorm was a Noldorin prince, the third of the seven sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel, born in Valinor during the Time of the Two Trees.  Celegorm was a hunter, and a friend of Oromë. He often followed the Oromë’s horn and, while his father and brothers were frequently guests at the halls of Aulë, Celegorm instead went to the house of Oromë where he obtained great knowledge of birds and beasts and learned all their tongues. Oromë further gifted the great wolfhound Huan to Celegorm.

During the unrest of the Noldor, Fëanor forged "fell swords" for his sons, and they followed him to Formenos when he was banished from Tirion. When Morgoth killed Finwë and stole Fëanor's beloved Silmarils, they all took the terrible Oath of Fëanor to recover the jewels, participated in the First Kinslaying at Alqualondë to obtain the Falmari ships, and abandoned the host of Fingolfin when they sailed to Middle-earth.

From their landing place at the Firth of Drengist, Fëanor's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim where they were attacked unaware by a host of Morgoth. In the battle that followed, Fëanor's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the Mountains of Shadow into Ard-galen.

Other armies of Morgoth, which had been besieging the Havens of the Falas, came north in an attempt to aid the routed forces, but they were intercepted by Celegorm and a part of the Elven-host at the hills near Eithel Sirion and driven into the Fen of Serech. Fëanor recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant orcs, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of Dor Daedeloth. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Maedhros was taken captive after feigning to treat with Morgoth. 

The host of Fëanor remained at northern shore of Lake Mithrim until the arrival of Fingolfin's host with first sunrise in  which prompted them to relocate to the southern shore of Lake Mithrim to avoid open hostilities with the larger host of Fingolfin. In  Maedhros was rescued by Fingon, and waived his claim of High King of the Noldor to Fingolfin before relocating the House of Fëanor to East Beleriand

### Establishment in Beleriand

Celegorm and his brother Curufin held and fortified the realm of Himlad, including the Pass of Aglon. This was situated between King Thingol's realm of Doriath, Maedhros' realm at Himring, and Eöl's realm of Nan Elmoth.

In , while Celegorm and Curufin were riding with Caranthir in Thargelion, his cousin Aredhel arrived at Himlad. Before they return, Aredhel disappeared, having unknowingly crossing into Nam Elmoth during her restless wandering. Celegorm and Aredhel never shown or said to meet again before her death. 

In  Morgoth broke the Siege of Angband with a massive assault against the Noldor.  Celegorm and Curufin held strong forces, with many horsed archers, behind Aglon, but they were overthrown and the Pass of Aglon was forced, though with great cost to the hosts of Morgoth. Celegorm and Curufin hardly escaped, and passed westward along the north borders of Doriath with such mounted following as they could save, and came at length to the vale of Sirion. The people of the city harboured their Fëanorian brethren,

In , Beren came to Nargothrond to ask for aid in his quest for the Silmaril as Finrod had previously sworn an oath to Beren's father Barahir to render whatsoever service was asked in hour of need to him or to any of his kin. Bound by this oath, Finrod summoned his people and declared that he would aid Beren and requested the help of his chieftains. Celegorm and Curufin, their own Oath now reawakened, both spoke against Finrod. Celegorm, drawing his sword, spoke first and declared that the Silmarils belonged only to Fëanor's sons, and that even should the quest be achieved they would slay any that kept the Silmaril or gave it to any hands but their own. Curufin spoke next, more softly but with no less power, of war and the ruin of Nargothrond, and instilled such fear in the hearts of the Elves that they refused to obey their king or go into open battle until the time of Túrin, forgetting all bonds of kinship.  In their hearts, Celegorm and Curufin thought to send Finrod to his death so that they could usurp his throne.  Finrod, forsaken, then gave his crown to Orodreth to govern in his stead and left with Beren and only ten other companions. With Finrod gone, Celegorm and Curufin further swayed the hearts of the people of Nargothrond, and Orodreth had no power to withstand them. The ultimate goal of the brothers was to take control of all Elf-kingdoms before then seeking the Silmarils.

With the aid of Huan, however, Lúthien escaped and the two managed to rescue Beren along with many Elf prisoners from Sauron. When these Elves, along with Huan, returned to Nargothrond the people learned of Finrod's death and Lúthien's great deeds and turned against the brothers, now perceiving their motives as treachery. Returned to power, Orodreth would not let Celegorm and Curufin be slain, and instead expelled them from Nargothrond.  None went with them; even Curufin's son, Celebrimbor, repudiated his deeds and remained behind. Huan, however, still followed his master Celegorm. Additionally, the wounding of Beren caused only half of the House of Haleth that dwelt in Brethil to come forth, and they joined Fingon and Turgon in the west instead of Maedhros.  In retaliation, Celegorm and Curufin vowed openly to slay Thingol and destroy his people if they were victorious and the Silmaril (now in Thingol's possession) was not then freely surrendered to them.

A Silmaril was in the possession of Thingol's heir, King Dior and Celegorm stirred his brothers to attack Doriath to seize it. In  the Sons of Fëanor attacked and Celegorm died at the hands of Dior himself, before he was also killed. His brothers Curufin and Caranthir were also killed in this battle.

## Etymology
- Celegorm* is not glossed, but being the Sindarized version of the Quenya name *Tyelkormo*, it would mean "Hasty-riser". It is actually North Sindarin, as it keeps the final *m*.

In the Noldorin phase of the name, it was rendered as ***Celegorn***, presumably meaning "Swift-impetuous".

## Other names
Celegorm's father-name was ***Turcafinwë*** ("Strong, powerful (in body) Finwë"), being ***Turko*** the short form.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier drafts, both Celegorm and Curufin present in Himald when Aredhel arrived. She expressed to them that she escaped from Gondolin of her own will and was glad to dwell with them and be free. The brothers considered sending a message to her brother King Turgon to inform him, but delayed as she was happy, the route was perilous, and Turgon would have demanded her immediate return.

In The Nauglafring, from the second volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, he is "pierced with a hundred arrows" and dies beside Cranthor (Caranthir) in the attack on Dior's realm.

In Lay of Leithian Canto X, from the third volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, it is Celegorm, instead of Curufin, who fires the two arrows at Lúthien.  His weapons are described as a "bow of yew with gold wire bound" and "a dwarvish dart and cruelly hooked"

Celegorm's hair color is often referred to as being blonde in early versions of the legendarium.  In the Quenta Silmarillion, from the fifth volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, Christopher Tolkien summarizes as follows:
