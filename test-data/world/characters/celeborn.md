# Celeborn

**Celeborn** was one of the noblest of the Sindar — who wedded the Lady Galadriel of the House of Finarfin and with her, he remained in Middle-earth after the end of the First Age. 

## History
### Early life
left|thumb|*Love at First Sight* by :Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa
Celeborn was a Sindarin prince of Doriath, being the grandson of Elmo, the brother of Thingol; thus, he was the grand-nephew of the King of Doriath.

In the late First Age, Finrod and Galadriel came to Doriath as guests of Thingol. There, Celeborn and Galadriel met, fell in love, and were soon betrothed. Galadriel remained in Doriath with Celeborn after Finrod went to the Caverns of Narog to establish the stronghold of Nargothrond.

### Second Age
After the fall of Beleriand, Celeborn and Galadriel lived in Lindon for some time. Celeborn ruled the fief of Harlindon, which was composed mostly of Sindar, under High King Gil-galad.

Galadriel and Celeborn crossed into Eriador with many Noldor, Sindar, and Green-elves in their following. For a while, they dwelt in the country about Lake Nenuial, ruling the Eldar in Eriador, including the wandering companies of the native Nandor. Probably around , a daughter was born to Galadriel and Celeborn, named Celebrían. It was ruled by Celebrimbor, grandson of Fëanor and the distant half-cousin of Galadriel. 

It was only sometime between  and  It was there, in , that his daughter Celebrían wedded Elrond Half-elven of Rivendell. 

When Amroth, the King of Lórien, perished in , Celeborn and Galadriel took up the rule of Lindórinand jointly, and were called the Lord and Lady of Lothlórien, the new name for Lindórinand, and together, they built Caras Galadhon.

During the War of the Ring in , Lothlórien received the Fellowship of the Ring, composed of various travellers on the quest to destroy the One Ring. Celeborn and Galadriel offered advice and boats for the Anduin, sending them on their way. After the Galadhrim repelled the forces of Dol Guldur three times, Celeborn led the forces of the Galadhrim across the Anduin and took the fortress. Galadriel threw down its walls and purified the forest.

On 6 April, he sought the Grey Havens and sailed west aboard Last Ship with his mighty kinsman Cirdan the Shipwright, but when he did so, he took with him the last memory of the Elder Days in Middle-earth. Teleporno's name gained an additional Quenya form, **Telporno** (pron. ).

He was given the epithet "the Wise" by Galadriel.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### As a Sinda
Before the summer of 1950 in an earlier version of the Appendix on Languages it was mentioned that the native language of Celeborn was *Telerian*, the native language of the Teleri who remained behind in the north-west of Middle-earth, of the Elves of Lórien and of the elf-kingdom in Northern Mirkwood of Thranduil, and that in the household of Galadriel also *Noldorin* was spoken, because she was a Noldo. It thus appears that Celeborn was a wood-elf in this earlier version. In a later version of the Appendix on Languages following a major revision of 1951, it is first mentioned that Celeborn was a Sinda (Grey-elf) and that most of the people of Lórien were of a woodland race. The text in the final version of *The Lord of the Rings* only mentions that Celeborn was a kinsman of Thingol. *The Lord of the Rings* does not mention the ancestry of Celeborn and if he was a Sinda or a Teler from Valinor. The text in *The Silmarillion* also only mentions that Celeborn was a *kinsman of Thingol* and that Galadriel stayed in Doriath, because Celeborn lived there and did not accompany her brother Finrod to Nargothrond, and calls him *Celeborn of Doriath*. *The Silmarillion* leaves the ancestry of Celeborn open and there is no mention if he was a Sinda or Teler, only implying that Galadriel met Celeborn in Doriath.

In a table with the descendants of Thingol from December 1959 Thingol's younger brother Elmo has a son Galadhon who has two sons, Celeborn and Galathil, and a daughter, Nimloth, who married King Dior. However, on the same table Nimloth also appears as the daughter of Galathil. It looks as if the second thought of J.R.R. Tolkien was that Nimloth was the daughter of Galathil and the niece of Celeborn. The genealogy according to this second thought was included in Unfinished Tales. According to that table, Celeborn is thus the greatnephew of Thingol and second cousin of Galadriel.

In a text written in 1965, Celeborn is born in Beleriand and he is a descendant of Elmo. In a rejected note he is the father of Amroth, and was left with his son after his (first) wife stole away and deserted them. Tolkien further noted that while remarriage seldom happened, it could occur in the time of such divided feelings as of the end of the First Age. born **Teleporno**, grandson of Olwë, prince of Alqualondë (thus he was a kinsman of Thingol in Beleriand). Only nine months before his death, J.R.R. Tolkien still was of the opinion that Celeborn was only a kinsman of Thingol afar off, because Celeborn came from Valinor and that his orginal name was *Telporno*.

In one c. 1969 version of the legendarium, Celeborn was the son of a Telerin Elf called Gilitīro.

Artanis, Olwë's granddaughter and a Noldorin princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet *Alatáriel*, meaning "Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland". 

Later, Teleporno and Artanis helped to defend Alqualondë from the Noldor during the First Kinslaying. Furthermore, the published *Silmarillion'' states "Eldar wedded not with kin so near," in reference to Maeglin's attraction to his first cousin Idril.
