# Gamling

**Gamling** (late Third Age) was a man of Rohan, probably Erkenbrand's lieutenant, and the leader of the garrison of Helm's Dike.

## Etymology
Gamling is an Old English name. It is derived from the stem *gamol*, which means "old", but is only found in Old English in verse-language

Gamling is somewhat anglicized/modernized while genuinely it should be *Gameling*. It would be one of the words and names that hobbits recognized as similar to Hobbitish (like *Shadowfax* or *Wormtongue*).

## Inspiration
Tolkien noted that it is the origin of the surnames Gamlen, Gam(b)lin. It appears in the medieval poem *The Tale of Gamelin* (inspiration of Shakespeare's *As You Like It*)

'*1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):**
:Patrick Barr provided the voice of Gamling.

**2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series):**
:Gamling was played by New Zealand actor Bruce Hopkins. His role was expanded to that of a lieutenant to Théoden.

**2010: *The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest*:*'
:Despite the game's heavy reliance on movie audio tracks, Gamling's speech at the departure from Edoras is not resampled, but dubbed in verbatim by Tom Kane.

'*2013: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Gamling's role is similar to that he has in the book. He welcomes Théoden's host to Helm's Deep, fights on the Helm's Dike and on the wall of the Hornburg and after the wall is blown retreats into the Glittering Caves along with Gimli and Éomer. Later, Gamling rides to Minas Tirith with Theoden's riders and survives the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
