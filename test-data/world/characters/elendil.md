# Elendil

**Elendil** (Quenya: "Elf-friend" or "Star-lover"), also known as **Elendil the Tall**/**the Fair** or **Voronda** ("The Faithful"), was a man of Númenor and the father of Isildur and Anárion who led the survivors of its Downfall to the shores of Middle-earth where they founded two Realms in Exile: Arnor and Gondor. Thus, Elendil became the first King of both realms and held the title of first High King of the Dúnedain, making him supreme overlord of all exiled Númenóreans in the lands east of the Great Sea. Elendil was killed alongside his friend, the High King Gil-galad, by the Dark Lord Sauron at the Siege of Barad-dûr, in the War of the Last Alliance in the late Second Age. 

## Biography
### Life in Númenor
Elendil was born in 3119 of the Second Age in Númenor, son of Amandil, Lord of Andúnië and leader of the Faithful (those who remained loyal to the Valar), who maintained a strong friendship with the Elves and preserved the old ways against the practices of Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron. For this Sauron hated Amandil, and by extension Elendil, the most out of all the Númenóreans.

When Ar-Pharazôn and Sauron were preparing their assault on Valinor, Amandil told him to gather the Faithful in Rómenna and escape to Middle-earth. Elendil did as his father bade, and gathered the Faithful and their wives and children in 9 ships, and waited just off the coast.

### Last Alliance of Elves and Men

In time Sauron returned to Mordor and began to rebuild his power. In SA 3429, he attacked seizing Minas Ithil. Isildur went north to take counsel with his father, leaving Anárion in charge of the defence of Gondor. In SA 3434, Elendil and Isildur returned south together with the Elven High King Gil-galad and their combined armies, in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.

After defeating Sauron's armies and advancing into Mordor itself, the armies of Elves and Men settled into a siege of the main tower of Sauron: Barad-dûr. During this siege Anárion was killed.
After seven years of siege, in SA 3441 Sauron came out to personally do battle with his enemies. Elendil, together with Gil-galad, overthrew Sauron, but they were both killed in the process, and Elendil's sword broke when he fell.

Isildur used his father's broken sword to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. Vanquished, Sauron's spirit fled. Isildur built a hidden tomb for his father on the summit of the hill of Amon Anwar, the midpoint of Gondor. Later, with the creation of the Kingdom of Rohan, the Steward Cirion had Elendil's casket moved to Rath Dínen in Minas Tirith.

### Legacy
Leading the remnant of the Faithful Númenóreans to Middle-earth, Elendil established strong regimes there and created the great alliance that put an end to Sauron's power for over a thousand years. His bloodline and spirited leadership survived in the Dúnedain of the North and South of Middle-earth, that would in turn sire the brave and heroic Men that would help bring a final end to Sauron in the War of the Ring.

Aragorn's battle-cry in the  was "Elendil!"*.*

#### The Oath of Elendil
In Quenya:''Et EärelloEndorenna utúlienSinome Maruvanar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-Metta*

Translation:*Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come.In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'"*

This oath was sung an age later by Aragorn II Elessar, during his coronation at the end of the War of the Ring.

## Description
Elendil was nicknamed "the Tall", because, even by the lofty Númenórean standards, he was exceptionally tall, at 2.5 *rangar'' or around 7'11. He was known as the greatest warrior of all the Dúnedain and the sword Narsil and the great horn Windbeam were his heirlooms.

## Etymology
- Elendil* meant either "Elf-friend" or "Star-lover" in Quenya. It was originally conceived when Tolkien was reading Anglo-Saxon texts, and came across the word *Elendel*; and to him it seemed a name of surpassing beauty, and could not resist putting it in the Legendarium.

## In adaptations
### *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy
Elendil has a brief appearance in  at the Battle of the Last Alliance, played by Peter McKenzie. Unlike in the books, Elendil is killed by a blow from Sauron attempting to do battle, instead of in a duel with him alongside Gil-galad. Instead, Isildur alone deals the fatal blow to the still-living Sauron by cutting off his fingers with the broken blade of Narsil, and with them the One Ring. Another deviation is Elendil's height; he is shown to be near the same height as most of his troops.

### *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*

An alternate Elendil is a major character in Amazon Studios' series , portrayed by Lloyd Owen. The setting precedes the Fall of Númenor and is thus before Elendil's reign in Middle-earth. He is altered as a character, having no exceptional height, and being barely familiar to the Queen as if he were not the son of the Lord of Andúnië.

Elendil begins the series as a captain in Númenor's Sea Guard, and father of Isildur, Anárion, and Eärien. On the high seas, he discovers a ruined raft with the unconscious forms of Galadriel and Halbrand, whom he takes back to the royal palace in Armenelos and presents to Queen-regent Míriel. Galadriel demands passage back to Middle-earth, and nearly incites hostility before Halbrand intervenes and arranges an agreement for a period of three days to be given for consideration of their request.

Míriel summons Elendil to return privately, and questions him about his motives in bringing Galadriel to Númenor, to which Elendil replies that it was the sea's will, then charges Elendil with ensuring Galadriel does not attempt to leave the island before a decision has been reached. This Elendil does, and is initially met with resentment from Galadriel before he reveals himself to be an Elf-friend, and a speaker of Quenya. Upon learning of the existence of Númenor's Hall of Lore, Galadriel asks to travel there, and Elendil accompanies her, and shows her that the hall was founded by Elros himself.

Elendil then returns to Armenelos and meets Isildur and Eärien for dinner, where he learns of Eärien's acceptance into the builder's guild, and of Isildur's wish to defer the sea-trials to become part of the Sea Guard, and rather meet his brother Anárion in the west of the island. Elendil warns Isildur against this, expressing the belief that he and his family must move on with the times, or lose their future.

Soon afterwards, Elendil accompanies Galadriel to an audience with Míriel, in which Galadriel demands Númenor's backing to save the Southlands from Sauron. Upon Míriel denying this, Galadriel demands an audience with Tar-Palantir, which prompts Míriel to put the Elf in prison. After eventually agreeing reluctantly to leave Númenor alone, Elendil escorts Galadriel to her boat. It is just then that the leaves of Nimloth begin to fall, causing Míriel to rethink her decision, and command that an army be sent to return with Galadriel. Elendil is put in charge of recruiting volunteers, of which Isildur becomes one of the first, though Elendil initially bars him from going, focusing instead on training the volunteers with Galadriel's help. Though Kemen partly sabotages the mission, burning two of the five ships allotted to go, Elendil leads the new troops in departing Númenor ten days after Míriel's announcement. Towards the end of the voyage, Elendil speaks briefly to Galadriel after the latter meets Isildur, and reveals that his wife perished by drowning after Galadriel inquires.

Upon landing in Middle-earth on the east bank of the Anduin, Elendil leads the Númenórean cavalry through what will one day be known as the Morgul Vale into the Southlands, coming to Tirharad at daybreak just in time to save the surviving villagers besieged by Adar. Though Elendil is pulled off his horse, Halbrand saves him with a timely spear throw, and Isildur rushes to his side. The Númenóreans make short work of the remaining Orcs, and afterwards celebrate with the villagers, introducing Halbrand as the Southlanders' rightful king. Elendil speaks to Isildur outside the village, comforting his horse Berek by speaking Sindarin, causing Isildur to wonder. Elendil promises to teach his son how to replicate the feat, but the two are startled when Orodruin suddenly erupts and take cover as ash blankets the Southlands.

Elendil helps lead Míriel back to the camp on the opposite side of the Ephel Dúath, though he realizes she was blinded by the ash, and is soon brought news that Isildur is believed to have perished saving the Queen Regent. After being tended to at the camp, Míriel announces her intentions to soon return to Middle-earth, grieving and angering Elendil. He still continues to faithfully aid Míriel however on the voyage back to Númenor, and reaffirms his commitment to the cause of the Faithful.

### *The Lord of the Rings Online*
In , Elendil appears in several flashbacks depicting the War of the Last Alliance. His ultimate fate is more accurate to the books than to the films: he and Gil-galad seen battling and defeating Sauron at the cost of their lives, with Elendil dealing the killing blow.

## House of Elros
Elendil's ancestor was Valandil of Andúnië, son of Elatan who married Silmariën, the daughter of Númenórean king Tar-Elendil. Valandil founded the Lords of Andúnië of whom Elendil was the last.
