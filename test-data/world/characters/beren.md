# Beren

**Beren Erchamion** was a renowned Mannish hero of the House of Bëor during the First Age.

His romance with the Elf Lúthien, and their Quest to obtain a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Morgoth, was one of the great tales of the Elder Days.

## History
### Life in Dorthonion

Beren was the son of Barahir and Emeldir and was named after Beren, his maternal grandfather. He was a Man of the royal House of Bëor of Dorthonion for his father was most likely the last Chieftain of the House of Bëor. The Dagor Bragollach ("Battle of Sudden Flame") befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his land. The young Beren lived with his father and ten loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the twelve of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of Morgoth, the Dark Lord of Angband. But due to the treachery of Gorlim the Unhappy, Barahir's outlaws in Dorthonion were slain at the hands of the Orcs of Sauron. Beren swore an oath to avenge his father. But he "wept not, for his heart was ice". He slew the orcs responsible for the death of his people and recovered from them the Ring of Barahir.

### Aftermath

Thus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on Tol Galen in the middle of the River Adurant in Ossiriand. There they stayed apart from other mortals. Lúthien bore Beren a son, named Dior, Thingol's heir.

Beren was involved with the events of the First Age only one further time. After the murder of Thingol, Mablung was sent by Melian to warn Beren. He gathered the Green-elves, and with the aid of some Ents they waylaid a group of the Dwarves of Nogrod who had destroyed Doriath and stolen its treasures. They ambushed the Dwarves and vanquished them in the Battle of Sarn Athrad. Because the Lord of Nogrod cursed the treasure, Beren threw it in the river Ascar, but salvaged the Nauglamir which he brought to his wife. Their son Dior left to restore and rule Menegroth.

## Characteristics
Beren had golden-brown hair and grey eyes. He was taller than most of his kinsmen, but (according to the trait of his House) he was broad-shouldered, and his limbs were very strong.

## Other names
His epithet ***Erchamion*** means "one-handed". Its Quenya cognate was ***Ercambo***. It has been suggested that ***Camlost*** means "empty-handed". Both epithets contain Sindarin *cam* ("hand").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first pencilled draft of the story of Beren and Lúthien, Beren was a mortal Man. However, Tolkien erased it and wrote the "Tale of Tinúviel" of the *The Book of Lost Tales* over it. In this version, Beren was an Elf: one of the Gnomes of Dor-lómin, the son of Egnor bo-Rimion the Forester. 

He arrived in Artanor (an early form of Doriath) and saw Tinúviel (the early name of Lúthien) as in the later work, although the backstory regarding the outlaws of Barahir is absent in the early tale. The displeasure of King Tinwelint against him was because the Dark Elves of Artanor considered those Elves treacherous. After being sent to obtain a Silmaril by Tinwelint, Beren heads directly to Angamandi, and is captured by orcs and brought before Melko rather than going to seek the aid of King Finrod Felagund. Throughout this early tale, the entire "Nargothrond element" is absent. Instead of being imprisoned in Tol-in-Gaurhoth by Sauron, Beren is put to work as a scullion in the kitchens of Tevildo, Prince of Cats, a very early narrative forerunner to Sauron. Upon his rescue from the castle of Tevildo by Tinúviel, he emerged with a kitchen knife which he later used to cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Melko. This weapon is used in place of Angrist, since the encounter with Celegorm and Curufin is absent in this early tale. 

After obtaining the Silmaril, the jewel and the hand of Beren were bitten off by the wolf Karkaras (an early name for Carcharoth). Beren and Tinúviel then fled and were found by Huan, who brought them to Artanor. This contrasts with the rescue of Beren and Lúthien from the gates of Angband by Thorondor and the Eagles in the published version of The Silmarillion; Christopher Tolkien remarks that "far more is made of the healing of Beren's wound" in the final work.

The death of Beren in the early tale follows a similar story arc, however Christopher Tolkien discusses the consequences of Beren's Elvish nature in the early tale here.

## Inspiration
The story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in *The Lord of the Rings*, was a central part of the Legendarium. Tolkien once referred to it as "the kernel of the mythology". He went on to say that it "arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks'", which he visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during World War I).

Tolkien seemed to be somehow connected to this character, and parallels can be drawn with his relationship with Edith Bratt. Furthermore it is possible that *Beren* (meaning 'brave') is a reference to the original meaning of his Germanic surname (Toll kühn) of similar meaning. It is said that, like the story of Lúthien dancing in the woods before Beren, that one day while Tolkien and his wife were on a picnic in the woods she danced for him, thus creating another parallel to Beren and Luthien. 

Tolkien was buried in Wolvercote Cemetery (North Oxford) and this name appears on the stone:

:JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 – 1973

The name of Lúthien also appears on the stone:

:EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971

John Garth has theorized that the name Beren could have originally come from Beren’s Hill in South Oxfordshire.
