# Faramir

**Faramir** was the last Ruling Steward of Gondor and the first Prince of Ithilien. 

The second of Denethor's two sons, Faramir was briefly the Ruling Steward after his father's death. Upon the arrival of the true king, King Aragorn Elessar, he laid down his office, but Elessar renewed the hereditary appointment of Steward as the advisor to the King. Faramir was also appointed Prince of Ithilien.

## History
Faramir was born in , five years after Boromir. Faramir was five when his mother Finduilas died. When that happened, Boromir and Faramir formed a great bond with each other. 
left|thumb|*Brothers study* by Catherine Chmiel
He grew to become a brave warrior admired by his soldiers, although unlike his brother, he did not care much for battle and arms and needless danger. He gained from the wisdom of Gandalf who visited Minas Tirith, and loved lore and music; his gentle nature (and love of Gandalf) displeased his father. Although Denethor grew cold and grim and favoured Boromir over him, there was no rivalry between the brothers; Boromir was always his helper and protector.

Twice Faramir had a prophetic dream and didn't speak about it, until he saw it again with his brother. The following day saw Sauron's attack on Osgiliath which started the War of the Ring. The two brothers commanded the defences of Osgiliath. They protected the last bridge across the Anduin until it was destroyed. Only the two brothers and two others survived by swimming.

Seeking clues for the dream, Boromir set out for Rivendell.

On 1 March, his father sent him for an errand to Ithilien where Faramir went to command the Rangers of Ithilien.

Faramir informed Frodo of Boromir's death, implying Frodo's involvement in it, though Frodo had not known of Boromir's death until that very moment. Unsure of how to deal with his captives, Faramir led Frodo and Sam, blindfolded, to Henneth Annûn. There he questioned them further in private, learning that the hobbits' errand was linked to the 'Isildur's bane' that had sent Boromir to Rivendell in the first place. Eager to earn their trust Faramir delivered his famous oath, saying that he "...would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and my glory. No, I do not wish for such triumphs". In a slip up however Samwise revealed the nature of 'Isildur's bane' and so Faramir was tested, just as Boromir had been, by the lure of The Ring. Where Boromir failed Faramir succeeded, leading Samwise to remark that Faramir had "shown [his] quality".

During the night, Faramir's watch spotted Gollum fishing in the Forbidden Pool. Faramir called Frodo to him who confessed to the part of Gollum in their errand, begging Faramir not to slay him. Gollum was caught and questioned and then surrendered to Frodo. The following morning Faramir with his men also left the refuge the next day.

Faramir remained out of action for the rest of the War of the Ring. During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields Denethor planned to burn his stricken son alongside him and Faramir was once again saved by Gandalf, though Denethor completed his suicide. After this he was taken to the Houses of Healing and healed by Aragorn after the battle. Faramir spent the rest of the war recovering in the Houses of Healing where he met Éowyn, also grievously wounded. The two fell in love and were married after the war.

### After the War of the Ring
After the destruction of the One Ring and the Battle of the Morannon, Faramir, as Steward, led the ceremony in the crowning of Aragorn as King of Gondor and Arnor.

## Etymology
- Faramir* is never glossed, and neither is indicated if it is Quenya or Sindarin.

As all the Kings of Gondor and their heirs had names in Quenya, and the name is also attested as a name of the royal family (in the case of Faramir son of Ondoher) the name apparently is Quenya.

## Genealogy

## Inspiration
Faramir was, in the words of Tolkien, "modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful". His appearance toward the end of *The Two Towers* apparently was as much of a surprise to Tolkien as it is to his readers. "I am sure I did not invent him," he wrote. "I did not even want him, though I like him". 

Faramir in many ways speaks for Tolkien, who was an officer in the British Army during World War I, when he says, for example, "I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness... I love only that which they defend". Much later, Tolkien would write, "As far as any character is 'like me', it is Faramir".

File:The Lord of the Rings (film series) - Faramir.jpg|Faramir in *The Lord of the Rings* (film series)
File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Faramir.jpg|Faramir in *The Lord of the Rings Online*

- '1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):'''
:Faramir's role has been omitted. However, a young black-haired man is shown at Aragorn's coronation, sitting on a horse beside Éowyn. It can be guessed that this is a cameo of Faramir. Whether he had at any time a larger part, that was cut for time restraints, is unknown.

'*1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):*'
:Faramir is voiced by Andrew Seear. Because Boromir already named him during the Council of Elrond - in the book, he is simply called "my brother" - much of the mystery surrounding Faramir's first appearance is lost to the attentive listener. His flight from the Nazgûl across the Pelennor is also omitted. However, unlike some adaptations Faramir's recovery in the Houses of Healing and his budding romance with Éowyn are included, as is his role at Aragorn's coronation.

'*1988: *J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth*:**
:Faramir is portrayed as a blond, bearded man. He can be controlled by the player.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Faramir is played by Friedhelm Ptok.

**2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*:*'
:David Wenham plays Faramir in this adaptation. He does not at first let Frodo, Sam, and Gollum go, but decides to bring them and the Ring to Gondor. He takes them west to Osgiliath, crossing the river Anduin, and not until the Ringwraiths attack the city does he release them. Many fans of the book criticise this change, saying that it seriously damages the character, who is meant to emulate the medieval chivalric code and contrast with Boromir. Peter Jackson's explanation is that he needed another adventure to delay Frodo and Sam, because the episode at Cirith Ungol was moved to the third movie, and so a new climax was needed. Another explanation often cited is that it was felt that for dramatic reasons it was necessary to show character *development*, which meant that Faramir had to go through some kind of struggle or difficult decision. Jackson also argued that it was necessary for Faramir to be tempted by the Ring because everyone else was tempted, and letting Faramir be immune would be inconsistent, at least in the eyes of a film audience, and would weaken the films' portrayal of the Ring. However, despite these comments, Aragorn still resists the Ring easily at the end of the first movie, which acts as a contradiction to Jackson's claim.

:In the Extended Edition, Jackson has included a flashback scene showing that Denethor has been neglecting him and favouring Boromir, so that Faramir wanted to please his father by bringing him the Ring. The relationship is similarly strained in the books, but there his father's favouritism does not seem to affect his decisions in Ithilien. On the whole, however, new Extended Edition scenes with Faramir brought the character closer to the sympathetic treatment of the books.

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*:*'
:Faramir's role in this film is largely faithful to that in the book.

'*2002-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Faramir is provided by Jozef Vajda. The same actor also portrayed Faramir's brother Boromir earlier in the radio series.

'*2015: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Faramir's role in the War of the Ring is relatively minor in the game, as by the time the player reaches Minas Tirith Faramir has already been wounded and lies in a fever. His first prominent appearance is not until King Elessar's coronation. Afterwards, Aragorn charges the Steward and the Rangers of Ithilien with cleansing the evil of Minas Morgul and the Morgul Vale. Faramir leads the Rangers to establish several camps outside the dead city. Eventually he joins Damrod's team inside the walls Minas Morgul itself, working to combat the evil on the upper levels of the city.
