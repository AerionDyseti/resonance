# Bill Ferny

**Bill Ferny** was a man of Bree, known to be an associate of the Nazgûl and later, a ruffian of the Chief's Men.

## Description
Descriptions of Ferny's appearance are limited to his being a "swarthy Bree-lander" or a "sneery swarthy fellow."

## History
Bill Ferny lived in the last house of Bree, and was an opportunistic backstabber who was little liked by respectable folk of the town. He also served as a spy for the Black Riders, and relayed information about Shire-hobbits to them.

On September 29th of , Ferny and his associate were at The Prancing Pony when the two of them saw Mr. Underhill vanish into thin air. They reported the information to the Black Riders.

After reporting to the Black Riders, Ferny and his allies went to the inn's stables and set all mounts loose. There was only one pony left in all of Bree: Bill's mistreated one. He sold him for twelve silver pennies to Strider and the Hobbits. As a parting gift, Samwise Gamgee threw an apple at his head.

Ferny's associate was spotted inside his house when the company set out to Weathertop.

After the Ruffians among the Southerners were kicked out of Bree, it was believed by Barliman Butterbur that Bill Ferny and Harry Goatleaf opened the gates to let them in since the two of them sided with Ruffians in the battle that followed. After fleeing Bree with the Ruffians, he threw in his lot with the Men serving Lotho Sackville-Baggins in the Shire. He guarded the outer gate at the Brandywine Bridge as the Chief's Big Man and his command over the local Shirriffs was hard. When the four Travellers returned to the Shire, he attempted to threaten them, but was threatened by Meriadoc Brandybuck in turn, and as such he fled into the night after giving him the gate key, though not until after his old pony had kicked him in his back. He was never heard of again.

## Etymology
- Bill* is a name Tolkien used to represent the Westron name **Bil**, which was a short for names as *Arambil*, *Bildad* and *Bilcuzal*, all of unknown meaning. *Ferny* is a reference to the plant, as many surnames of Bree were botanical in nature.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In an earlier draft of The Scouring of the Shire, it is Frodo who threatens Ferny rather than Merry. Later, Sam compares Ted Sandyman to Ferny.
