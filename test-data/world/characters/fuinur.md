# Fuinur

**Fuinur** was a Black Númenórean lord.

## Biography

Like all Black Númenóreans, Fuinur fell under the influence of the Dark Lord Sauron during the late Second Age while he was on the island of Númenór.

He sailed east with Herumor to the lands of Harad, and the two became lords among the Haradrim.

## Etymology
The name ***Fuinur*** comes from *fuinë*, meaning "deep shadow". There appears to be no definitive origin of the word *fuinë*, though it appears in style to be Quenya.
