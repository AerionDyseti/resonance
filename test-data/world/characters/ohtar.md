# Ohtar

**Ohtar** was the esquire of Isildur in the early Third Age.

## Biography
Ohtar's age is unknown, and it is likewise not stated whether he was born in Númenor or in Middle-earth. In TA 2, when Isildur and his company were ambushed in Gladden Fields by a troop of Orcs, the king commanded to Ohtar to save the shards of Narsil, the broken sword that belonged to his father Elendil:* *

- "Save it from capture by all means that you can find, and at all costs; even at the cost of being held a coward who deserted me. Take your companion with you and flee! Go! I command you!"*

Thus it was Ohtar and his companion that delivered the shards of Narsil to Rivendell after Isildur was killed, and there they were kept in safety.

## In adaptations

In , Ohtar appears in an extended flashback depicting the the War of the Last Alliance.
