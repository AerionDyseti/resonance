# Bandobras Took

**Bandobras Took**, commonly known as **Bullroarer**, was a Hobbit of the Shire and the hero of the Battle of the Green Fields.

## Biography
Born in TA 2704, Bandobras Took was the second son of Shire-thain Isumbras III, and would be the great-great-grand-uncle of Bilbo Baggins. Bandobras was noteworthy among Hobbits for his exceptionally large stature, being four feet, five inches tall, and his ability to ride a horse. He was the tallest Hobbit on record until the Ent-draughts taken by Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took made them the tallest Hobbits in the history of the Shire.

Bandobras also gained fame for leading the Hobbits at the Battle of the Green Fields in TA 2747 when goblins from Mount Gram in the Misty Mountains invaded the Northfarthing. Bandobras, it was said, charged the goblins' ranks with a wooden club, and knocked the goblin chieftain Golfimbul's head clean off, sending it sailing a hundred yards through the air and down a rabbit-hole, thus winning the battle and inventing the game of *Golf* at the same time.

From Bandobras were descended the North-tooks of Long Cleeve, where Peregrin Took's wife Diamond would hail from. He died in the year TA 2806.

## In adaptations
