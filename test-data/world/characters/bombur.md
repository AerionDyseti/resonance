# Bombur

**Bombur **was a Dwarf who accompanied Thorin Oakenshield and Bilbo Baggins on their quest to the Lonely Mountain as part of the company, alongside his brother Bofur and cousin Bifur. Bombur was noted as the fattest Dwarf in the company.

## Biography
Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown, though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the loss of Thráin II.

### Journey to the Lonely Mountain
Bombur was the twelfth Dwarf arriving at Bag End to attend the meeting arranged by Gandalf, where the quest to reclaim Erebor began. Because he was commonly considered to count for two Dwarves due to his girth, he was the last to arrive at Beorn's house and the last to cross the Enchanted stream in Mirkwood. Bombur tumbled with Bifur and Bofur onto Thorin when they first entered Bag End. He chose to stay and guard the camp and supplies while the others moved up the Lonely Mountain, because he trusted neither mountain paths nor ropes to stay intact under his weight. However, he was later forced to use the ropes to escape the rampaging dragon Smaug before he could be slain.

Bombur was often asleep during the Quest of Erebor. When he was violently knocked into the Enchanted stream by an aggressive stag, he fell under a spell which caused him to sleep for several days, burdening the others with his weight as they traveled. Later Bombur awoke up, but different. Bombur had forgotten their previous adventures during their journey, only remembering the feast in Bilbo's home. When his barrel was opened after the escape from the Elvenking's Halls, he was found to be asleep. Once they arrived at the Lonely Mountain, he was assigned a midnight watch and was asleep when Bilbo discovered the Side-door. After the death of Smaug, Bilbo promised to keep watch to allow Bombur to rest. He then snuck the Arkenstone out of the mountain and delivered it to the Elvenking and Bard the Bowman.

He fought and survived along with most of the company at the Battle of Five Armies. After the defeat of Smaug, Bombur received his share of the treasure and remained at the Lonely Mountain until the end of his days.

### Later years
In , many years later while in Rivendell, Frodo Baggins learned from Glóin that Bombur had grown so fat it that it now took several Dwarves simply to lift him from his couch to the dinner table. It is unknown if Bombur fought in the Battle of Dale during the War of the Ring.

## Behind the scenes
According to *The History of The Hobbit: Mr Baggins and Return to Bag-End* by John D. Rateliff, in the never-completed third revision of *The Hobbit*, Bombur, along with Bifur and Bofur, was to become an honour-guard of sorts to Thorin. Such a change finds some evidentiary support in the book; Bifur, Bofur and Bombur all arrive at Bag End at the same time as Thorin, and they also climb up the same tree when the company is attacked by Wargs and Goblins.

## In adaptations
### The Hobbit film (1977)

In the animated version of *The Hobbit*, Bombur has a major role in Thorin's company alongside Balin and Dori. He fights in the front lines in Battle of the Five Armies, and takes spear damage by a warg rider. Unlike in the book, he is killed in the Battle of Five Armies. His last words are to Bilbo, "We won." He was voiced by Paul Frees.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's live-action *The Hobbit* films, he was portrayed by Stephen Hunter. In 2012, the studio released the following statement about Bombur's character:

- Brother to Bofur and cousin to Bifur, Bombur is the chief cook amongst The Company of Dwarves. His immense size and voracious appetite causes frequent problems – and laughter – for himself and The Traveling Party. Despite his size he can be surprisingly effective as a fighter – and woe betide anyone who makes him late for dinner!*

Unlike in the book, Bombur appears less frequently and has virtually no dialogue in the films other than grunts or retorts. In the extended edition of the third film, he speaks after the axe in Bifur's head is removed. Throughout the films he is largely a source of comic relief, most of which pertains to his size and love of eating; such as catching food in mid-air, being able to outrun his fellow Dwarves despite his girth, exceptional fighting skills, and breaking a table under his own weight with the addition of merely an ounce of food in his hand.

In *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug*, due to Beorn chasing Thorin and Company, Bombur, frightened, surprises the Dwarves by running fast until he collides with the door and then panicked until they went inside. Gandalf would later tell Bombur he counts "as two" Dwarves while the Dwarf eats a carrot. During their journey through Mirkwood, Bombur falls into the Enchanted River. He falls asleep for a couple of days. Later, a Giant spider attempted to eat him, deeming him "fat and juicy". During the escape at the Elven gate, Bombur rolls on many Orcs and fights in it until fleeing into another barrel. When Thorin plans to drown Smaug in gold, Bombur gets the billows working. 

- Bombur also appears as a hero card in *The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game*, by Fantasy Flight games. He belongs to the Lore sphere, and has the text effect "When counting the number of Dwarf characters you control, Bombur counts as two."

- In , Bombur is found feasting in the "Hall under the Mountain" in Erebor, as well as in other locations in the Lonely Mountain where he holds the position of the of Warden of the Larder. At some point after the Battle of Dale he and the other surviving Dwarves of the Company pay respect to tomb of Thorin Oakenshield, now next to that of King Dáin II Ironfoot. A popular drink in the Thorin's Hall Inn in Ered Luin, "Bombur's Beard Lager", is named after him.
