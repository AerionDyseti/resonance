# Telchar

**Telchar** was a Dwarf of Nogrod in the Blue Mountains during the First Age.

## Biography

Telchar was one of the greatest smiths of the First Age of Middle-earth, having learned from Gamil Zirak the old. Telchar was commonly regarded amongst the greatest smiths of all time, save only Fëanor and Celebrimbor. Among his works were the knife Angrist, the sword Narsil (later reforged as Andúril), and the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin, worn eventually by Túrin Turambar.

Neither Telchar's lifespan nor details of his personal life are known, but it is known that the Dragon Helm of Dor-lómin was made shortly after the dragon Glaurung first appeared, in the 265th year of the First Age. 

## Earlier versions

In earlier versions of the legendarium, such as the second version of *The Lay of the Children of Húrin *(in *The Lays of Beleriand*) and those in the The Shaping of Middle-earth, Telchar was originally one of the Dwarves of Belegost. In this version Telchar made the Dragon-helm in the dark dwarf-land in the deeps of time.
