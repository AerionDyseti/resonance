# Galadriel

**Galadriel** was a Noldorin Lady who witnessed Middle-earth during the Three Ages. 

Galadriel was born in Aman as one of the Noldor. She was the daughter of Finarfin and Eärwen as well as younger sister to Finrod Felagund (later King of Nargothrond), Angrod, and Aegnor. She took part in the Exile of the Noldor, following Fëanor in his rebellion. However, she opposed the Kinslaying at Alqualondë and crossed the Helcaraxë with the rest of Fingolfin's followers. After arriving in Beleriand, she lived mainly in Doriath, where she befriended Melian. Later, with her husband Celeborn, she ruled over the woodland Elves of Lothlórien, and together they had a daughter, Celebrían, who married Elrond. 

She is described as "the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in Middle-earth", and the "greatest of Elven women". Throughout the Third Age it was unknown who wielded the Three Rings, but during the War of the Ring, Galadriel revealed to Frodo Baggins that she was the bearer of Nenya. After the War, she returned to the Uttermost West.

## History
### Elder Days
#### Life in Aman

Galadriel was born in Eldamar in the Year of the Trees 1362. She was the fourth child of Finarfin, prince of the Noldor, who named her ***Artanis***. Her mother was Eärwen, princess of the Teleri, who named her ***Nerwen*** ("Man-maiden"). Galadriel grew beautiful and tall, even for the women of the Noldor, being strong of body, will, and mind, "a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days of their youth."

Indeed, "she was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats". This custom was the origin of her Sindarin name ***Galadriel*** ("Maiden crowned with gleaming hair"), which was given to (and accepted by) her much later, in Beleriand. The gleaming of her hair was not a mere poetic reference: her hair was held a marvel unmatched. It mingled and surpassed the gold hair of her father and the starlike silver of her mother, so the Eldar said that both lights of the Two Trees were captured in her tresses. It was also said that this first gave the idea to her uncle Fëanor of capturing the merged light of the Trees, which would result in the making of the Silmarils. He asked her three times for one of her tresses, but she always refused. Fëanor and Galadriel were always unfriends, both being the greatest Eldar in Valinor; and if Fëanor was greater than she, she was wiser, and her wisdom grew with the long years. For she also had an outstanding gift to see into the minds of others, and, though she judged most with kindness, she hated and feared the darkness in Fëanor, not perceiving that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the Noldor, including her own. Like the rest of the House of Finarfin, she was also supportive of the Exile by the desire to aid their Sindarin relatives in Middle-earth. during the troubles that followed she fought fiercely against Fëanor by defending her mother's kin during the Kinslaying at Alqualondë and the rape of the ships. Afterwards, she even desired to follow Fëanor to disturb him in all the ways that she could, but nothing could have moved her to return since she had begun her way to exile, as her pride was strong then as it was thereafter.

#### Arrival to Middle-earth

Once in Beleriand, those of the House of Finarfin were eager to enter Doriath, but King Elu Thingol received the Noldor coldly, and only allowed entrance to those invited by him after some inquiries. Finally in , Finrod and Galadriel became long guests in Doriath, but her brother eventually departed to the Caverns of Narog to establish the stronghold of Nargothrond. Galadriel did not go with him, and remained in Doriath with Celeborn, a kinsman of Thingol, as there was great love between them. Despite their love, they did not marry each other, following the custom among the Eldar of avoiding marriage and child-bearing during the war, but they were eventually betrothed till the war ended. Meanwhile, she dwelt with Queen Melian, from whom she learned much of the wisdom of Middle-earth. It is safe to assume Melian benefited from this.

Years passed in Doriath, and Galadriel became dear to Melian, and they spoke often to one another about Valinor. Melian was eager to learn the causes of the Exile of the Noldor, but Galadriel would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. In the year , Melian asked her directly about this, and Galadriel revealed the story of the Silmarils and how the Noldor fled from Aman against the will of the Valar, though she still left out the Oath of Fëanor, the Kinslaying, and the burning of the Ships at Losgar. Melian was able to discern a darkness that was left unsaid, but Galadriel refused to tell her more. Thus, Thingol became concerned regarding the Noldor, and he was informed soon afterwards of the Noldor's dark deeds in Aman, and it chanced that the children of Finarfin were visiting Galadriel in Doriath. Egged on by his accusing words, Angrod told everything, and Galadriel's brothers departed heavy-hearted. when the kingdom of Nargothrond was finished and a feast was held for all the children of Finarfin. She dwelt for a while in Nargothrond, and in this time she asked Finrod why he remained unmarried. Her brother answered with dark foresights about his kingdom. Galadriel heard another foretelling, as Melian told her about a Man who shall cross into Doriath moved by a doom greater than the Girdle of Melian.

Galadriel did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the War of the Jewels, but she might have been well informed of the deaths of her brothers Angrod and Aegnor during the Dagor Bragollach; and of Finrod's, while he was held in captivity by Sauron in the year . At some point before the Fall of Nargothrond in , she and Celeborn passed over the mountains Being one of the chief leaders of the Noldorin rebellion, Galadriel was not allowed to return and a ban was set upon her, to which she replied that she had no wish to do so.

### Second Age

At the beginning of the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel dwelt for a time in Lindon, south of the Lune, while Gil-galad ruled in the north. Both left Lindon before the years 10-20, when Gil-galad became king in that land, apparently thanks to her influence. They entered Eriador and dwelt for a while around Lake Nenuial, being followed by many Noldor, Grey-elves and Green-elves. They were considered the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador. Probably around , Galadriel and Celeborn had a daughter: Celebrían. Celeborn was not fond of Dwarves, but she saw the importance of getting close to them, for she saw military interests even with them. Also, she was a Noldo, and therefore close to them in mind and in the passion for crafts; and in Valinor she had learned from Yavanna and Aulë, the creator of the Dwarves himself.

About the year , Sauron came in disguise to Eriador, but he was only welcomed in Eregion by Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths, who were interested in his advice on craftsmanship. "*He perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle, and he endeavoured therefore to placate her, bearing her scorn with outward patience and courtesy*". At the same time, without her knowledge, Sauron influenced Celebrimbor and his Gwaith-i-Mírdain against Galadriel and Celeborn. Finally, he moved them to expell Galadriel from Eregion at some time between  and 1400. Thus, Galadriel and Celebrían left through Khazad-dûm to Lórinand, although Celeborn would not enter the Dwarvish realm and remained in Eregion. but of their whereabouts during the final millennia of that Age nothing else is known.

### Third Age
#### Rule in Lórien
In early Third Age, in the year , Galadriel and Celeborn's daughter Celebrían wedded Elrond the Half-elven. who, being a good friend of Gandalf, recommended that he be made head of the Council. But this distinction fell instead to Saruman.

The White Council would not take action until Gandalf discovered that the shadow growing in Dol Guldur was Sauron. After deliberating, the Council joined forces and drove Sauron out of Dol Guldur in .

#### War of the Ring

Galadriel and Celeborn were well informed about the Company of the Ring, its members and their mission, before its coming to Lothlórien, perhaps informed by messages from Rivendell. In the evening of 17 January of , the Company arrived at Caras Galadhon. Coming to the talan of the Lady and Lord, each member was greeted by name by Celeborn. Noticing that Gandalf was missing, Galadriel asked where he was, for she wished to speak with him. Hearing that they had encountered Durin's Bane and that this was in fact a Balrog from ancient times, Celeborn criticized the passing of the Company through Moria. However, Galadriel was more sympathetic, especially towards Gimli, who bowed to her in respect. Before inviting the members of the Company to rest and heal there, she looked deep into their eyes and they all felt their hearts exposed.

Among the gifts was the Elfstone, which she gave to Aragorn from Arwen "*as a token of hope*". Galadriel stated she was unsure as to what to give Gimli, and asked what he wanted. After complimenting her beauty, he requested a single strand of her hair. Instead, she rewarded him with three strands, which he promised to put into an imperishable crystal in memory of her. And last, to Frodo, she gave a a small crystal phial specially prepared by her, which contained the light of the star of Eärendil.

The land of Lórien was not exempt from the battles of the War of the Ring: between 11 and 18 March, the Galadhrim suffered three assaults from Dol Guldur. Soon afterward, Galadriel threw down the walls of the fortress and opened its pits.

Two years later, on 22 September , On 29 September, they reached the Grey Havens and departed over the Sea. Thus ended the Third Age. And in , it is said that Gimli went to the West out of his desire to see Galadriel again. He may have been allowed thanks to her intervention.

## Etymology

- Galadriel* is a Sindarin name translated by Tolkien as "maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance", and "maiden crowned with a radiant garland". *Galadriel* consists of *galad* ("light, radiance") + *rî* ("crown").

Tolkien notes that the element *galad* had no relation to Sindarin *galadh* or Silvan *galað* ("tree"). Due to this coincidence the name *Galadriel* was occasionally rendered as ***Galadhriel***, as Tolkien explains:

## Other names
At the time of her birth, Finarfin named his only daughter ***Artanis***. Her father-name meant "Noble Woman" in Quenya, from *arta* + *nís*.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium

### The History of *The Lord of the Rings*
The first appearance of the character of Galadriel in the legendarium was during the composition of *The Lord of the Rings*. The first reference J.R.R. Tolkien ever made to her was in some notes for the "Lothlórien" chapter, which mentioned that a "Lord of Galadrim and a Lady" went to the White Council. The following phrases are a stub of them receiving the Company of the Ring, both clad in white and with white hair. In other isolated notes about this chapter, Tolkien wondered "if Galadriel is alone and is wife of Elrond."

The first mention of "Keleborn and Galadriel" by name was in the narrative of the following chapter, although Tolkien considered other Elvish names before writing *Galadriel* in ink. There Galadriel describes Keleborn and herself as "*wise beyond the measure of the Elves of Middle-earth*", and says that they "*have dwelt there since the Mountains were reared and the Sun was young*", from which Christopher Tolkien deduced they were both conceived as exiled Noldor.

In a list of matters "to be explained before the end", Tolkien wondered about what happened with Galadriel after the War of the Ring:

In sum, earlier and rejected names during the composition of *The Lord of the Rings* were *Finduilas*, *Rhien*, *Galdrin*, *Galdrien*, *Galadhrien*, and *Galadrien*.

### Expanding the First Age
In the Appendix F of *The Lord of the Rings*, Tolkien had already stated that Galadriel was "of the royal house of Finrod, father of Felagund, Lord of Nargothrond" (in the Second Edition, Tolkien changed the names to *Finarfin* and *Finrod Felagund*, respectively). Although not using much detail, Tolkien was thus introducing Galadriel in "The Silmarillion" tradition, and having finished *The Lord of the Rings*, he began the work of expanding the backstory of the character. Galadriel enters this tradition in the *Annals of Aman*, in which she is first mentioned when Tolkien decided the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) would be related to Thingol through Eärwen. In the *Annals*, written after the publication of *The Lord of the Rings*, Galadriel stands out by being valiant and the only woman leading the Exile of the Noldor, but there is no explanation of the nature of her rebellion or its later impact on her life.

Indeed, Christopher Tolkien explains that when the chapter "Farewell to Lórien" was written, his father had not conceived the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return due to her role in the Flight of the Noldor. In a letter from 1953 (even before *The Lord of the Rings* was published), Tolkien did not object to the comparison of Galadriel with the Virgin Mary, a comparison he would object to later. 

Written in the same years, the *Grey Annals* follow the *Annals of Aman*, telling the chronology of Beleriand, mainly after the Return of the Noldor. Here Galadriel's rol is briefly expanded, limited to her relation with Melian and a conversation with her brother Finrod. The darkness pending upon all the Noldor is explicitly mentioned, but the same happens with the innocence of the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) during the discussions with Thingol and Melian. Sadly, Tolkien left these *Annals* unfinished at the point of the Wanderings of Húrin, so nothing is told about Galadriel at the end of the First Age, neither about her relation with Celeborn.

### Expanding the Second Age
After the publication of *The Lord of the Rings*, Tolkien most expanded the story of Galadriel in the Second Age in "Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn". This manuscript is the only full narrative dealing with this matter, but sadly it is a stub full of corrections, and Tolkien never solved some contradictions that would be raised later. Christopher comments that what is now remarkable is that there is still no presence of the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return: she stays in Middle-earth out of her love for Celeborn. There could be some pride on her part, as she was eager to visit Middle-earth, but later she stays in Eriador after the first fall of Sauron as a sort of duty until he was finally defeated.

### Unstained exile
In a letter written in August 1973 (one month before his death), Tolkien gave a completely different description of Galadriel: 

This was not an isolated idea; around the same time he wrote an outline of the revised backstory of Galadriel, which he could not carry into narrative, as it ended up being probably his last writing related to the legendarium. Here Galadriel is described as totally opposed to Fëanor from the beginning, and she felt confined in Aman and desired to depart to Middle-earth in order to exercise her talents: "for being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the Valar thought fit to give the Eldar". Manwë was probably aware of her desire and he had not forbidden her to depart, nor given permission yet. Nonetheless, Galadriel did not remain inactive and thought in the ships of the Teleri, so she dwelt in Alqualondë with her mother's kin. There she met Celeborn (here a Telerin prince and her cousin), and both planned to build a boat and seek the permission of the Valar to depart to Middle-earth. 

But then Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the Two Trees, and Fëanor began his rebellion, in which Galadriel had no part. "Indeed, she and Celeborn fought heroically in defence of Alqualondë against the assault of the Noldor, and Celeborn's ship was saved from them". Now Galadriel sailed in despair without asking Manwë, and indeed she would have been told to stay in Valinor in that hour, despite her desire being legitimate; and thus the ban against departure fell upon her and she was forbidden to return. She and Celeborn reached Middle-earth before Fëanor, finding Círdan's haven and being received with joy. They did not join the war against Morgoth, which they considered hopeless without the help of the Valar, and instead they recommended going eastwards and befriending the Dark Elves and Men living there. But the Elves of Beleriand did not heed these counsels, so both of them crossed the Ered Lindon before the end of the First Age. They were granted permission to return by the Valar, but they rejected it.

Christopher Tolkien explains that this change probably had its roots in the philosophical implications of Galadriel's power in Middle-earth. He is certain that his father had the intention of changing all the narrative of "The Silmarillion" related to the backstory of Galadriel, despite what was already written: after all, she was not part of the story of the Noldor in the first place and the book had not been published. The only notable problem is in the backstory of Celeborn, which contradicts what was already published in J.R.R. Tolkien's life. It is unclear which version was written as definitive, but Christopher Tolkien chose the former one for Chapter 15 of his edition of *The Silmarillion*.

;:Passing over the mountains
Christopher Tolkien explains that in the first conception, Galadriel went to the east from Beleriand alone and found Celeborn (probably of Nandorin origin) in Lórien. Hence in the chapter "The Mirror of Galadriel" she said Celeborn dwelt in the West before the Dawn, and that she crossed the mountains from Beleriand (apparently alone). This contradicts the information in Appendix B of *The Lord of the Rings* and in *The Road Goes Ever On*, in which Celeborn is a Sinda who accompanied Galadriel from Lindon.

;:Marriage of Galadriel and Celeborn
In Appendix B, while describing the beginning of the Second Age, it is said that Celeborn dwelt in south Lindon with his wife Galadriel, so it appears that they were married at this point. In a manuscript from 1965, while Tolkien pondered about Amroth being their child, he wrote that Galadriel and Celeborn were betrothed, but did not marry until the confusion of the War of Wrath and the beginning of the Second Age had ended (till S.A. 24). For more details see *Amroth#Other versions of the legendarium*.

;:Founder of Eregion
In Appendix B, it is said that at the beginning of the Second Age, the Noldor went to Eregion out of their interest for the mithril in Moria. Besides, Celebrimbor is called "Lord of Eregion", with no mention of his relation with Galadriel. It is unclear if these texts are necessarily contradictory, but it is clear that trying to explain the rule in Eregion remains problematic.

### The published *Silmarillion*
Christopher Tolkien was aware of his father's latest conception, in which Galadriel left Aman free of any guilt. However, as this was a mere projected idea, he had to make use of the completed narratives for his edition of *The Silmarillion*, in which she is a rebel leader.

### Films
'*1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:Galadriel is voiced by Annette Crosbie.

**2001: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*:**
:Galadriel is played by Cate Blanchett. Galadriel narrates the Prologue, explaining the creation of the Rings of Power and the War of the Last Alliance. Earlier plans considered were to have either Frodo or Gandalf narrate the Prologue, but this was dropped: Frodo was not alive until thousands of years after these events happened, and although Gandalf was alive, he was not present in Middle-earth at the time; the Wizards came some one thousand years after the Prologue ends. Thus Galadriel narrates the Prologue, because she had first-hand accounts of this history and actively participated in its events.

**2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*:*'
:Galadriel frequently consults telepathically with Elrond; in the books there is no clear indication of how Galadriel knew about the coming of the Fellowship. In the film, unlike the book, Galadriel and Elrond send an army of Elves - led by Haldir - to Helm's Deep to aid the Rohirrim. In the DVD commentary, Peter Jackson and his fellow writers explain that they worried audiences would wonder why the Elves do not seem to be helping in the war, while at the same time, they felt that actually inserting an entire separate battle scene at Lothlórien would take up too much screen time and resources.

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*:*'
:A spiritual apparition of Lady Galadriel appears to provide Frodo strength following his passage through Shelob's Lair soon after he uses the Phial that she gave him. She is later seen leaving Middle-earth along with other Ring-bearers, but in film version her husband Celeborn departs with her at the same time.

'*2012-14: *The Hobbit* (film series):*'
:Cate Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel, although the character is absent from the novel. She appears as part of the White Council alongside Saruman, Gandalf and Elrond. Later, right before Thorin and his Company enter in Mirkwood, she telepathically urges Gandalf to further seek the true identity of the Necromancer. Finally, during the attack on Dol Guldur, Galadriel plays a larger role. She first rescues Gandalf from captivity, and is ultimately the one to drive Sauron from the fortress using her phial, although weakened by the amount of power she used.

### Television
**1993: Hobitit:**
:Galadriel is portrayed by Heidi Krohn. She appears only in the episode *Lórien*, and she is featured as a reflection on the surface of the lake.

**2022: The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power:**

:Galadriel is portrayed by Morfydd Clark as one of the central characters of the series. Lady Amelie Child Villiers portrays Young Galadriel in Episode 1 as a child.

### Radio series
'*1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):*'
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by Marian Diamond. In addition to the Lothlórien episodes, the voice of Galadriel is heard in Shelob's Lair as a reminder to use the phial, and she appears with Elrond in the final episode in the Shire, as they journey towards the Grey Havens.

'*2001-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):*'
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by Soňa Norisová. Norisová also provides most of the singing in the series (including the opening and closing titles theme and series closing song), alluding to Galadriel being a secondary storyteller (with Bilbo Baggins serving as the series' primary storyteller).

### Games
'*2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):**
:Galadriel, voiced by Jennifer Hale, is the narrator of the Prologue and the Epilogue, and appears in Lothlórien.

**2006: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II*:*'
:Galadriel is the strongest of "Hero" units available to the Free Peoples. If a player's army manages to spot Gollum on the battlefield, take The One Ring from him and deliver it to their forces, the option to "summon" Galadriel unlocks for a large amount of resources. Thus, Lady Galadriel is represented as succumbing to corruption of The Ring, similar to the respective scene in the *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* movie.

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Introduced in *The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria*, Galadriel plays a prominent role during the Epic storyline with guidance and support. During the final days of the War of the Ring, Galadriel assembles the Council of Elven Lords, where it is decided to bring their armies against Dol Guldur. After she brings down the walls of Dol Guldur, Galadriel accompanies Arwen on her journey south to her wedding, and they visit the site of Celebrian's captivity in the Misty Mountains together. Afterwards, she and Celeborn join the procession of Elrond's house and travel to Minas Tirith to attend the wedding of Arwen and Aragorn.

**2014: Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor:**
:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character. She is voiced by Jennifer Hale and she narrates the prologue in a showing of the game.

**2017: Middle-earth: Shadow of War:**
:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character, with Jennifer Hale reprising her role from the game.
