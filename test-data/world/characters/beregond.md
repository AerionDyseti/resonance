# Beregond

**Beregond**, son of Baranor, was a soldier of Gondor and later Captain of the White Company.

## History
### Early life
Beregond's fathers were from the vales of the White Mountains, and prior to that they lived in Ithilien.

Beregond was a member of the Third Company of the Citadel. He admired Faramir and saw him as a brave warrior and a great leader. Beregond did not travel outside of Minas Tirith often but understood the threat that Sauron posed to the city.

### War of the Ring
On the morning of March 9th, , Beregond was assigned to help Peregrin Took who had just become a Guard of the Citadel. As Beregond had never met a hobbit before, he was eager to meet Pippin and he was astounded that Pippin looked much like a child yet had faced more dangers than most Men of Gondor.

After helping to carry Faramir to the Houses of Healing, Gandalf gave the key to the Closed Door to the injured Faramir. Beregond stood guard over Faramir at the Houses of Healing and was present when he awoke.

#### Battle of the Morannon
Pippin and Beregond served under the command of Imrahil at the Battle of the Morannon. When a Troll-chief charged their ranks, Beregond was stunned and nearly killed, but Pippin managed to save his friend by killing the Troll, which fell on top of him.

### Later life
Upon Aragorn's coronation on May 1st, Beregond was brought forward to receive judgement for leaving his post and for killing Denethor's guards on hallowed ground. The penalty would have been death, but the King showed mercy as the deeds were done out of love for Faramir, and Beregond was merely dismissed from the Guard of the Citadel. For his bravery in battle, Aragorn appointed him the Captain of the Guard of Faramir, which was also called the White Company. He later went to live in Emyn Arnen in Ithilien to serve his lord, Faramir, the new Prince of Ithilien.

## Etymology
