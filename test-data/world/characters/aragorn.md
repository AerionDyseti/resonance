# Aragorn

**Aragorn II** was the son of Arathorn II and Gilraen. He was the last Chieftain of the Dúnedain and a direct descendant through many generations of Isildur, the last High King of both Arnor and Gondor. Aragorn would become the greatest Man of his time, leading the Men of the West against Sauron's forces, helping to destroy the One Ring, and reuniting the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor.

## History
### Early life
Aragorn was born in  to the Chieftain Arathorn II and received the name Aragorn. His grandmother, Ivorwen, noted with foresight that Aragorn would one day wear on his breast a green stone.

A legend says that the Wizard Gandalf had brought such a stone, called the Elessar, from Valinor. He gave the Elessar to the Elven Lady Galadriel and remarked prophetically that she would pass it to another, who will also be called Elessar. From this would come Aragorn's royal name *Elessar* (Quenya for "Elfstone").

When Aragorn was two years old, his father was slain when an Orc arrow pierced his eye. As was the tradition of his people, Aragorn was fostered in Rivendell by Elrond as if he were his own son. The Wise decided that his identity was to be kept secret, as the last Heir of Isildur would be vulnerable to the Enemy. Aragorn was called ***Estel*** (Sindarin for "Hope") instead. During his youth in Rivendell he accompanied the twin sons of Elrond, Elrohir and Elladan, on their journeys. At Gandalf's advice he started to become interested in the Shire and became known as ***Strider*** in this region.

From  to  Aragorn took great journeys aiding the West against Sauron and his allies. After serving King Thengel of Rohan, he went to Steward Ecthelion II of Gondor,

Ecthelion was anticipating an attack from Sauron, who had just returned, and Thorongil warned him that in that event the Southern Fiefs would be vulnerable to the Corsairs of Umbar. He was allowed by Ecthelion to take a few ships and lead an attack against Umbar; at night he burned many ships, and in a fight, slew the Captain of the Haven with only few casualties. Great honour awaited him in Minas Tirith but he did not return; while in Pelargir, he sent a farewell message to Ecthelion, speaking of other tasks calling him, and saying that fate would not bring him again to Gondor soon. To the grief and wonder of his companions he crossed the Anduin and was last seen staring at the Ephel Dúath.

### Hunt for Gollum
In the year , as a now revealed Sauron continued to regain power in Mordor, Aragorn began assisting Gandalf in his search for news of Gollum. Gandalf suspected that the ring Bilbo Baggins found near Gollum's lake was in fact the One Ring. where the Elves sent a message to Gandalf. He travelled alongside the Anduin to the north until he arrived at the Carrock. With the aid of the Beornings he crossed the Anduin with Gollum and entered Mirkwood. He took Gollum to Thranduil to be held captive.

### The War of the Ring
When Aragorn returned to his area, the Wandering Company of Elves who followed Gildor Inglorion told Aragorn the Black Riders had been seen, Gandalf had been missing and there were no messages from him. Aragorn and his Rangers kept watch over the border of the Shire and the East Road waiting for sight of Frodo but there was no news of them leaving Buckland. After the ambush at Weathertop and the wounding of Frodo, Merry took over the position as leader of the Hobbits. After a while they met Glorfindel, a friend of Aragorn’s, and it was not much later that they arrived in Rivendell.

After the Council of Elrond, Aragorn became a member of the Fellowship of the Ring. As a preparation for his travel, the ancient shards of Narsil, the heirloom of his House, were reforged after 3 millennia. Aragorn carried the Sword Reforged, and renamed it Andúril.

Aragorn's intentions were to travel with the company for a while before returning to Gondor with Boromir. Aragorn encouraged the taking of the Redhorn Pass, which ended in disaster. He conceded to Gandalf’s choice to pass through Moria, but warned Gandalf to be cautious if he entered Moria, because he had a very evil memory from his previous visit to Moria.

#### Leading the Fellowship of the Ring
Aragorn again amazed the rest of the Fellowship by his apparent closeness to the people of Lothlórien, and his friendship with Celeborn and Galadriel. At their departure, Galadriel offered him the Elfstone as a wedding gift from the family of the Elven bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen. It was worn by Aragorn ever after, and from that he later took the name **Elessar**.

Even at the Falls of Rauros he was undecided, leaving it to Frodo for the final decision. For though it was obvious he wished to go to Minas Tirith with Boromir, he yet felt that it was his duty to go where the Ring-bearer chose.

After Frodo escaped him and Boromir perished, he with the remaining members of the Fellowship, namely Legolas and Gimli, chose to try and save Merry and Pippin from the Uruk-hai that had ambushed them, forming the group that would later be known as the Three Hunters.

He met Éomer in the fields of Rohan, and an instant friendship formed, both feeling the honesty and lordliness of the other. Éomer took a risk for his sake, giving him horses, with the promise that one day Aragorn would return to Edoras. After the restoration of Théoden, he rode to Helm's Deep to fight in the Battle of the Hornburg. There he, alongside his new-found “brother” Éomer, and King Théoden, marshalled the defence against Saruman’s army. His revealed majesty upon the battlements of the Hornburg as he waited for the dawn caused some of the Wild men to pause and shudder, and he heralded the return of Gandalf with Erkenbrand.

After Pippin’s terrifying experience with the Orthanc-stone, Gandalf presented it in a formal manner to Aragorn, its rightful master, who hinted that it would be used by him eventually. After the departure of Gandalf and Pippin to Minas Tirith, he rode for a while longer with Théoden, meeting up with his friend Halbarad of the North, Elladan and Elrohir, and a company of staunch and fearless Rangers. Elladan and Elrohir gave him a message from Elrond: "*The days are short. If thou art in haste, remember the Paths of the Dead*". Halbarad bore a gift from the Lady Arwen – the standard of Elendil. Aragorn knew the path set before him.

Aragorn held council with his trusted companions, namely Gandalf, Éomer, Imrahil, and Elrond’s sons – Halbarad had fallen in battle. He agreed to draw forth the forces of Mordor for the benefit of the Quest of the Ring, and so arranged matters for the Battle of the Morannon.

### Reign as Elessar
Aragorn ruled the Reunited Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until year  of the Fourth Age.

Some days after his coronation, Gandalf took Elessar up the slopes of Mount Mindolluin, and there he found the scion of Nimloth, the symbol of his mastery of the Reunited Kingdom. Elrond and Arwen came to Gondor and Elrond gave Elessar the Sceptre of Annúminas signifying the Kingship of Arnor. He wedded Arwen on Midsummer's day of 3019,

Elessar gave his Steward Faramir the title Lord of Emyn Arnen and created him as Prince of Ithilien. He declared the Drúadan Forest to belong to the Drúedain and a protected enclave of his Kingdom. He also re-established the Great Council of Gondor whose chief councillor was the Steward. He also renewed the Oath of Eorl with Éomer.

As for the Shire, he declared it a Free Land under the protection of the Northern Sceptre and forbade Men from entering it. He appointed the Thain, the Master of Buckland, and the Mayor of Michel Delving Counsellors of the North-kingdom. Also he offered to the Shire the lands up to the Emyn Beraid.

He founded the royal House of Telcontar, he had a son, Eldarion, and a number of daughters. Tolkien later wrote that he was at least 6'6".

### Personality
Aragorn held his heritage in high esteem and was willing to commit to a single path in life in the name of love. Yet this will did not prevent him from honoring his own word and the words of his forebears. Aragorn was also described as 'Elven-wise' due to spending his youth in Rivendell with Elrond as well as learning from Gandalf. He was an extremely capable swordsman, as he was able to survive the Battle of the Pelennor Fields unscathed along with Éomer and Imrahil. He was also a capable military tactician, as during that same battle, he was able to reinforce the Rohirrim and hit the weakest point of the army of Mordor, along with taking time to rearrange his army's positions during the Battle of the Morannon. He was also a skilled healer, most notably with the herb Athelas, as he was able to heal Faramir and Éowyn of their wounds, It contains the phonetic reduction *ara* of *aran* ("king") and the adjective *(n)gorn* ("dreaded, revered").

- Thorongil - S "Eagle of the Star", a pseudonym used in Gondor and Rohan. **Edhelharn** is the Sindarin word for Elfstone (Q. *Elessar*). Derived from the words *edhel* "elf" and (lenited) *sarn.* Pronounced .
- Elfstone - The Common Speech version of the previous two.
**Envinyatar* - Q "the Renewer". This title was claimed by Aragorn after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It referred to the prophecy that he would renew the hope of the Dúnedain by reuniting the Two Kingdoms.
- Estel - Q. Usually glossed as "Hope", the concept *estel* more widely means "hope, trust, a temper of mind, steady fixed in purpose, and difficult to dissuade and unlikely to fall into despair or abandon its purpose". Pronounced .
- Strider - A sobriquet given by the men of Bree. The Hobbits frequently referred to him as initially "Mr. Strider", and later just "Strider".
***Wingfoot** - An honorary name given by Éomer after the pursuit of the Uruk-hai through the Eastemnet.
Telcontar - A Quenya form of "Strider", this was the name of Elessar's Royal House. It was not used independently.  Pronounced .

***Arakorno** - A rare Quenya form of Aragorn, which only appeared in a discussion about the words for Quenya. Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the kings of the three kindreds of the High Elves (Ingwë, Finwë, and brothers Elwë, Olwë, and Elmo) as well as the only line with Maiarin blood through Arwen's great-great-grandmother, Melian. There were at least two marriages between descendants of Elendil in Aragorn's ancestry, so Aragorn was related to Arwen by blood along at least three lines.

Through his father, Arathorn II, Aragorn was Arwen's first cousin sixty-two times removed through his ancestor Arvedui and sixty-seven times removed through his ancestor Fíriel. Both of these lines descend through four generations of the Kings of Númenor, and Elendil, as well as Aranarth and fifteen succeeding generations of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain, including Aragorn himself. Aragorn's mother Gilraen was also descended from Aranarth,

In the first edition of *The Lord of the Rings*, Aragorn's year of death was S.R. 1521. The month and day of his death and the year in the reckoning of Gondor were not stated.

### Films

:Aragorn meets the Hobbits at the *Prancing Pony Inn* and joins them after a letter from Gandalf confirmes he is trustworthy. On the way to Bree, they meet with Glorfindel who heals Frodo and gifts him Asfaloth. Aragorn arrives at Rivendell and participates in the Council of Elrond. He was chosen as the representative for the race of Men in the Fellowship of the Ring. He departed from Rivendell second, after Gandalf.
- '1978: *The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)*:**
:The voice of Aragorn is provided by John Hurt. Some critics have commented that he looks Native American.

**1980: *The Return of the King (1980 film)*:**
:Aragorn was voiced by Theodore Bikel in the 1980 Rankin/Bass animated film. His role is dramatically reduced to a handful of scenes and there is no mention of any previous involvement with the Fellowship of the Ring.

**2001: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*:'''
:Aragorn is played by Viggo Mortensen, though Stuart Townsend was originally cast in the role. Townsend was deemed too young and parted ways with the production over creative differences. Mortensen had just two weeks to train for his first scene, the standoff with the Nazgûl at Weathertop. In a notable departure from the source material, Aragorn, due to his lineage including those who fell to the temptation of evil (namely Isildur), is riddled with anxiety and self-doubt regarding his place as king of Gondor. He is also portrayed as wary of Men's strength and potential, likely owing to being raised among Elves. Nonetheless, he promises a dying Boromir that he will not let Minas Tirith fall. He also claims Boromir's bracers (which have emblems of the White Tree), which symbolise a gradual acceptance of his heritage.

'*2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*:*'
