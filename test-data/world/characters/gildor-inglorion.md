# Gildor Inglorion

**Gildor Inglorion** was a Ñoldor Elf met by Frodo Baggins on the edge of the Shire, at the beginning of Frodo's venture out of his home.

## Biography
On September 24, 3018, Gildor and a company of Elves were passing through the Shire, singing as they walked, and inadvertently caused a Nazgûl who was seeking Frodo to flee. Gildor recognized Frodo, though they had never met, for he knew Bilbo. He invited Frodo, along with Sam Gamgee and Pippin Took, to spend the night in the Elves' company. To the three Hobbits, Gildor and the Elves appeared to shimmer as they walked through the night. The starlight glimmered in their hair and eyes. They camped in a clearing in the Woody End near Woodhall and the Elves provided the Hobbits with bread and fruit and a fragrant drink.

Frodo stayed up late talking to Gildor about the many dangers that the Hobbits might soon face. Frodo had greeted Gildor by saying, "Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo" (A star shines upon the hour of our meeting) impressed with his knowledge of the ancient tongue and lore he commended Frodo and named him Elf-friend. Gildor perceived that the Enemy was seeking for Frodo, though he did not know why. He was reluctant to give Frodo any advice in Gandalf's absence. Word also reached Rivendell, and Glorfindel rode out to find Aragorn and the Hobbits as they were pursued by the Nazgûl from Weathertop.

Gildor and the Elves continued on their way. Gildor had told Frodo they were tarrying in Middle-earth before heading to the Grey Havens to pass over the Sea to the Undying Lands. Where they wandered is not known, but on September 22, 3021, Gildor and Frodo met once again in the same spot in Woody End where they had met three years earlier. Along with Elrond, Galadriel and Gandalf, they journeyed to the Grey Havens. Gildor may have been among those that departed over the Sea into the West. This means that he could only have a son after he died in Middle-earth, and went to the Halls of Mandos. He might have been resurrected by Mandos, and then married Amarië. It is very unlikely (probably impossible), however, that he would be allowed to return to Middle-earth. The only such instance would be Glorfindel, and it is doubtful that if that was the case, there would be no mention of it in Tolkien's writings. Furthermore, Gildor would not describe himself as one of the Exiles.

Furthermore, it is said that there were only two children Idril and Orodreth "in the third generation from Finwë to go with the exiles."

It should also be noted that Tolkien initially used names from his *The Silmarillion* writings rather at random in *The Hobbit*, and the first drafts of the sequel which would become the *The Lord of the Rings*. Other examples are the mention of Gondolin and the appearance of Elrond in *The Hobbit,* which were only later brought into alignment with the *The Lord of the Rings* and the unpublished mythology by a third edition of the book. It is likely that after realizing what the work had become Tolkien would have removed *Inglorion* as a name of Gildor, just like he intended to rename Glorfindel. In the end, neither of these changes actually were made.

This all suggests that, while Gildor might have been initially intended to be Felagund's son, in the final version he probably became a member of the House of Finrod as one of its servants, not one of its sons.
