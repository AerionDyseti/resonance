# Forlong

**Forlong** was the Lord of Lossarnach during the War of the Ring.

## History
Forlong was famed for both his girth and his vitality at old age, which led the people of Minas Tirith to refer to him as both "Forlong the Fat" and "Forlong the Old".

## Etymology
- Forlong* was a Pre-Númenórean name of unknown meaning.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2015*: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:'''
:Forlong is first found in Minas Tirith before the battle in the "Merry Swan" tavern on the third level of the city, reminiscing on their youth with his friends Hirluin and Neldir. Later, both Forlong and Hilruin fight in the defence of the White City on the walls of the First Cicle. After the Rohirrim army arrives, both of them rush outside the city gates and faces their foes together before Hirluin is slain in view of his friend. Forlong himself is gravely wounded and after the battle is over is found by the player on the field. He shares that he saw the visage of Thorongil on the field of battle but believes it to be his dying fever until Aragorn comes to his side. Amazed to see the man from the days of his youth untouched by years, Forlong departs in peace.
