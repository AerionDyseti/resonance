# Lorgan

**Lorgan** was a chief of the Easterlings that occupied Hithlum after the Nírnaeth Arnoediad and claimed the rule of Dor-lómin under Morgoth.

## Biography
After Morgoth's victory in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad in the year 472, Lorgan's people were given parts of the Northlands. Lorgan claimed the lordship of the northern land of Dor-lómin in Hithlum, which had been ruled by Húrin Thalion until he was captured in the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.

In the year 488, Lorgan's Men and Orcs launched an attack on the Elves that attempted to guide the sixteen-year-old Tuor to the south. Tuor was captured, and held as a servant by Lorgan for three years. During that time, Lorgan treated Tuor worse than his other thralls because he was related to his former lords and "he sought to break…the pride of the House of Hador". Despite this, however, Tuor endured it all "with watchful patience" until Lorgan slightly lightened "his lot". In the year 494, Lorgan heard of Niënor's beauty and desired to take her by force. However, Morwen and her daughter managed to escape to Doriath, seeking the news of Túrin. In the spring of 495, he was sent to the border of Hithlum riding with a guard of soldiers as if in high honor. The Eastrons avoided adversity with Húrin to maintain Morgoth's trust, and allowed him to roam about in Lorgan's lands untouched. Húrin's bitterness was increased and even if he had wished he could not have roused a rebellion.

In time, Húrin acquired a small following, composed of Asgon and six others. Deciding to leave Hithlum, Húrin marched up to Lorgan's halls to look upon him and his Men in scorn and to announce his departure from Hithlum. Lorgan was glad that Húrin was going and asked his "friend" to tell Morgoth that Húrin had not been ill-treated during his stay. Húrin rejected Lorgan's friendship and announced that his supposed service under Morgoth was a lie. At this, Lorgan's Eastrons drew swords to kill Húrin but Lorgan restrained them. Due to being more cunning and wicked than the others, Lorgan perceived that Morgoth pretended pity for the steadfastness of Húrin, letting him go free so as to unwittingly spread his malice. Afterwards, Lorgan told Húrin to leave, but wished him ill.
