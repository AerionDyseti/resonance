# Durin's Bane

'''Durin's Bane''' was a Balrog who had no other recorded names. 

Durin's Bane was notable for surviving the War of Wrath. After sleeping deep within the Misty Mountains for thousands of years, he was awoken by the Dwarves of Moria in the Third Age and was responsible for the death of King Durin VI and the ruin of Moria. It was this Balrog that was encountered by the Fellowship of the Ring during the Quest of the Ring.

## History
### Early history
Durin's Bane was first created as a Maia. However, like other evil spirits, the Balrog followed Morgoth to Arda soon after its creation, contending with Manwë and other Valar.

It is not known in which of the Battles of Beleriand Durin's Bane fought in until the end of the First Age, nor whether he served under Gothmog, the Lord of Balrogs. When the Host of the Valar defeated the hosts of Morgoth in the War of Wrath, Durin's Bane managed to flee the overthrow of Thangorodrim and escaped into the east and hid in the roots of the Misty Mountains beneath Khazad-dûm.

### Awakening and the Third Age

For more than five millennia, Durin's Bane hibernated in his deep hiding place at the roots of the mountains in Khazad-dûm. He remained undisturbed throughout the Second Age and most of the Third, before the *mithril*-miners of Dwarven King Durin VI awoke him in . Durin was slain by the Balrog, at which point he became known as "Durin's Bane"., and the survivors were forced to flee. and, as a result, many of the Silvan Elves of Lothlórien fled to the south. Over the course of many years, he became acquainted with the ancient tunnels delved by mysterious nameless things underneath Moria and the Mountains.

Around , Orcs began to make secret strongholds in the Misty Mountains to block all of the passes, and Sauron began to send some of his creatures to Moria. The Balrog allowed the Orcs and trolls to remain in Moria while he dwelt there, but they feared him.

The Battle of Azanulbizar was the climactic battle in the War of the Dwarves and Orcs. It took place before the Great Gate of Moria in T.A. 2799 and was a victory for the Dwarves. However, the victors did not conquer Moria because Dáin Ironfoot, having slain the Orc Azog, felt the terror of the Balrog at the gate. Despite a failed attempt to recolonize Moria by Balin in T.A. 2989, Durin's Bane remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the Dwarves, and its nature remained hidden to the outside world.

### Passing of the Fellowship

In January of T.A. 3019, the Fellowship of the Ring travelled through Moria on the way to Mount Doom, reaching the Bridge of Khazad-dûm on 15 January of that year.

In the first full narrative of the chapter, the description of the Balrog is more human-like, which Tolkien noted should be changed to be less clear: "*A figure strode to the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go before it. They could see the furnace-fire of its yellow eyes from afar; its arms were very long; it had a red [?tongue]. Through the air it sprang over the fiery fissure. The flames leaped up to greet it and wreathed about it. Its streaming hair seemed to catch fire...*". Tolkien also rejected a sentence of Gandalf's cry to the Balrog: "*Go back into the fiery depths. It is forbidden for any Balrog to come beneath the sky since Fionwë son of Manwë overthrew Thangorodrim.*"

Although it had no repercussion on the final version of the story, Tolkien considered in a hasty note that the battle on the Bridge was actually between Gandalf and Saruman, apparently resulting on Gandalf coming out clad in white.

In the drafts of the "Lothlórien" chapter, Celeborn and Galadriel think that no Balrog could lie in the Misty Mountains, so it should have been sent by Sauron from Orodruin.

'*1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:The Balrog has wings and appears capable of limited flight. The head resembles a lion but the rest of the body was rendered in matte black, a technique commonly used for shadowy surreal effect in rotoscope animation.
**1981:** ***The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)'''''

The identity of Durin's Bane as a Balrog is apparently common knowledge among the Wise as Gandalf explains its history to the Fellowship in Moria before their encounter with it. He initially fails to connect this with the dark power he encounters, and Celeborn still has no knowledge of it. Balrogs are bafflingly stated to be the deadliest of the servants of Sauron though Gandalf also refers to it as a Spawn of Melkor

'*2001: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*:*'
:Durin's Bane has wings. Jackson's Demon of Might was indistinct, a real blend of shadow and fire. Only his horned head, cloven feet, and clawed hands could clearly be seen. In the film continuity, the Orcs of Moria (here specified as "goblins") have crafted their armor and weapons to match the fiery appearance of the Balrog.  Gandalf is also aware of the creature's identity prior to entering Moria, having previously learned of it from Saruman.

'*2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):*'
:The Balrog is the boss of the level "Abyss Fight". He cannot be harmed except when he is stunned with Gandalf's lightning.

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age*:*'
:The players must assist Gandalf in his fight with the Balrog. This fight is notable among players of the game for its difficulty and the Balrog's very high amount of health points.

'*2004: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth*:*'
:Many of the Evil factions can summon a Balrog, specifically Durin's Bane, for a short period of time. He is one of the mightiest units in the game, only able to be summoned with experience points. He is similar in design to the Balrog in the movie.

'*2006: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II*:**
:Like in the previous installment, the Balrog can be summoned by evil factions.

**2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:The real name of Durin's Bane is given as "**Askâdurs**" and he is revealed to have fought against Dwarves as part of Morgoth's armies during the First Age. He is encountered in various flashback instances (where the player controls historical characters), which showcase his awakening by Dwarves in TA 1980, the fall of Khazad-dûm the year after and the Dwarves of Balin's company fleeing from the ancient evil, among others. After Gandalf defeats him, the lifeless body of Durin's Bane can be found on the slopes of Zirakzigil. Despite the players knowing that the Balrog is dead, another Servant of Sauron tests their will and fears by portraying an illusion of him. In the illusion, the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog on the Endless Stair is recreated, until it ends the opposite way of the actual event: the Balrog defeats the Wizard, throwing his lifeless body from Zirakzigil. Players have to defeat the Balrog in order to combat the illusion.

'*2009: *The Lord of the Rings: Conquest*:*'
:Durin's Bane is resurrected after his defeat by Gandalf, and must be fought again in Moria. In the Evil Campaign, Durin's Bane is playable in two battles. He kills Gimli, who makes his last stand in Moria, and Treebeard, who takes part in the final battle for the Shire.

'*2013: *Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game*:*'
:Durin's Bane is only seen as a light that chases the player(s) through Moria. When they reach the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, he appears in a cutscene where Gandalf destroys the bridge and the Balrog pulls him down. The player then controls Gandalf and has to grab Glamdring and land on Durin's Bane and stab him while avoiding the Balrog's fiery breath. When this is over, the game starts another cutscene that ends the level. Later, Gandalf appears on a snowy mountain with a tower on top. When he reaches the top of the tower, the Balrog climbs on. The Balrog repeatedly sweeps his fiery whip and strikes the ground with his sword. Lightning then begins to strike at one place and the Balrog breathes fire and is weakened. Gandalf then uses his sword to direct the lightning at Durin's Bane and his health goes down. The lightning will strike at three different places and when the Balrog loses all of his health by being hit three times, he will fall off the mountain and die.

'*2022: *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*, Season One:**
:**Episode 7: *The Eye*:*'
::Durin's Bane makes an appearance lurking beneath a large Mithril vein at the very depths of Khazad-dûm. When an orange leaf lands directly in front of him and catches on fire, disturbing his slumber, the Balrog roars.

'*2024: *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*, Season Two:*'
:Durin's Bane appears after Durin III digs into a cavern full of Mithril at the urging of a Dwarven Ring of Power. In spite of his son Durin IV's attempts at saving him, he is killed after removing his ring and jumping toward the Balrog with his axe before the entire cavern collapses around him.
