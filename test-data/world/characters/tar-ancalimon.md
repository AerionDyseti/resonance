# Tar-Ancalimon

**Tar-Ancalimon** was the fourteenth King of Númenor. He succeeded his father, Tar-Atanamir.

## Biography

During Tar-Ancalimon's reign, the people of Númenor became divided and two opposing parties arose among Númenóreans: the Elf-friends, or *Elendili* (also called "The Faithful"), advocated continuing devotion to the Valar and friendship with the Elves, and the "King's Men" who opposed the Ban of the Valar and friendship with the Elves, advocating Númenor's independence and self-determination, seeing how they had reached the apex of their might.

During his time, the Elven tongues were discouraged and were no longer taught to Númenórean children. The royal titles however were still taken in Quenya out of respect for ancient customs rather than love for the Eldar. The Great Eagles which had formerly nested in an eyrie in the King's Palace in Armenelos, were no longer fed during his reign and departed. His policies would later contribute to the Fall of Númenor.

Tar-Ancalimon ruled for one-hundred and sixty-five years and was succeeded by his son, Tar-Telemmaitë.

## Etymology

The name ***Ancalimon*** means "Most Bright" in Quenya.
