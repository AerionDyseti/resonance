# Ælfheah

**Ælfheah** was one of the seven companions of Ælfwine on his voyages, according to the early version of the legendarium in the text called *Ælfwine of England* from *The Book of Lost Tales*, and the only one whose name was remembered afterwards.

## History
After much voyaging and searching for the Island of the Elves, Ælfheah was the one who advised Ælfwine to put an end to his quest and return to his home; however, soon after they spotted the lights coming from the West in Tol Eressëa - but a strong westerly wind pushed them back eastwards, except Ælfwine who jumped out of the ship and swam toward the isle.

Ælfheah's final fate is uncertain, but he most likely died at sea, since it was said of all the seven companions of Ælfwine that eventually "Ulmo Lord of the Sea afterward took them to himself".

## Other names
An earlier name for the character was *Gelimer*, possibly being a latinization of a Vandalic name (exemplified by the King of the Vandals and Alans Gelimer), deriving from the Proto-Germanic *gailaz* ("merry") + *mērijaz * ("famous, renowned").

The name *Gelimer* was itself a change from an earlier form *Helgor*.
