# Círdan

**Círdan** was one of the highest and most noble of the Sindar,

When Morgoth broke forth in the First Battle in , Círdan was cut off and unable to come to Thingol's aid. Further, although Thingol prevailed with the help of the Laiquendi, the Green-elves of Ossiriand, the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the Return of the Noldor from Aman, when Fëanor struck at Morgoth from the north. The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the Orcs were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by Celegorm and his forces, and the Falas was saved.

##### Wars of the Noldor
Círdan attended the Mereth Aderthad with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Noldor.

When the tales began spreading (sown by Morgoth) of the Kinslaying of Alqualondë, Círdan, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumors sprouted from great malice. Knowing the jealousy and dissention among the Noldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers. Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard. This resulted in Thingol banning the speaking of Quenya and greater strife between the Sindar and the Noldor.

Círdan made up for his lack of participation in the wars of the Noldor with his role in the Second Assault on Hithlum, coming to the timely aid of Fingon when he was most needed. The ships of Círdan sailed up the Firth of Drengist in great stength and then struck the unsuspecting Orcs from the west, giving victory to the Elves.

Many years later, in , after the disastrous Nirnaeth Arnoediad, many fugitives came for shelter in Círdan's havens. The Falathrim mariners harassed the orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea. But it was only a matter of time before Morgoth attacked. Then came the disastrous Fall of the Falas. Though both Brithombar and Eglarest were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the impressive array of siege-masters Morgoth had in his train. Although Círdan's people fought valiantly, the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved. Barad Nimras was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste. But Círdan and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him the young Gil-galad, one of the last of the princes of the Noldor. They came to the Isle of Balar and founded a new refuge, but kept a foothold at the Mouths of Sirion, keeping ships hidden in the reeds there.

#### Refuge in Balar
Turgon, the King of Gondolin, receiving the dreadful news, requested that Círdan send mariners to seek Valinor and the aid of the Valar. Círdan built seven swift ships, and sent them westward. None returned, save for only one mariner of the Gondolindrim who was also his kinsman. The way to the West was closed. From that time on, Círdan was given foresight surpassing that of any of the Elves,

At the very beginning of the Second Age, Círdan was instrumental in devising and overseeing the construction of the boats that were used to transport the remnants of the Edain to their new land, which would later become the realm of Númenor.

Círdan personally elected the Elven captains and helmsmen who were in charge of transporting the Edain to Númenor, and since those boats were small, it took a great number of such boats to transfer all of the Edain and their possessions - a process that took at least 50 years, and which only ended when the Valar instructed Círdan to cease any future migration of Men to the island. doubtless being the foremost authority on both.

Círdan advised against the creation of the Rings of Power when Annatar came, but, like Galadriel, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the ambition of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain. Nevertheless, when the Three Rings  were hidden, Celebrimbor had appointed him to inherit one of them and so, Círdan received Narya, the Ring of Fire. 

### Third Age

After the War of the Last Alliance and the death of Gil-galad, Círdan remained the Lord of the Havens. but at around , a shadow began to lengthen. It was at this time the Istari, sent by the Valar, came. Círdan was the most foresighted of all Elves in Middle-earth, and he alone knew the true purpose of the Istari.

In , Círdan sent Elven sailors from Lindon on a ship to Forochel to rescue the lost king Arvedui. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished. The next year, Círdan and the Elves of Lindon joined with the remnants of Arnor in the victorious Battle of Fornost. Later, Círdan took control of the abandoned Elendil Stone on Emyn Beraid, which could gaze into the lost west and was without link to the other *palantíri*.

Nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the War of the Ring in  and later in . Galdor was his messenger to Rivendell and attended the Council of Elrond, speaking with authority on his lord's behalf. or "Shipwright".

The Quenya cognate was ***Ciryatan*** (pron. ).

## Other names
Círdan's original name was ***Nōwē***. According to Paul Strack, it was a Primitive Elvish name, but its meaning is unclear.

He was also called ***Cirdan the Shipwright***, as well as ***Cirdan of Lune*** Likely, he had grown a beard since having reached his third cycle of life.

## Significance
130px|thumb|left|*Cirdan the Carpenter* by :Category:Images by David Greset|David Greset
Círdan had a profound effect upon the course of Middle-earth history. He was a loyal servant and friend of Elwë, sacrificing his heart's desire in search of him.

The name *Círdan* in this outline was spelled as *Cirdan*, and in one other instance as *Kirdan*.

### *The Etymologies*
However, Círdan's first appearance in the legendarium as a whole seems to be in *The Etymologies* (dating from the late 1930s), where his name was instead given as *C(e)irdan* ("shipbuilder" in Noldorin), with the *(e)* probably indicating a development from the Noldorin word *ceir* ("ship"). The name *Ceirdan* was itself changed from an earlier form *Certhan*.

### Later legendarium
In a late text called *The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor* (c. 1969), there appears a passage in which Tolkien briefly considered Círdan as being one of the Noldor, in a text explaining the origin of the name *Belfalas*:

However, Carl Hostetter later comments, quoting Christopher Tolkien's own commentary on the text:

At no other point in the legendarium was Círdan ever considered a Noldo.
