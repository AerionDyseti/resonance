# Thuringwethil

**Thuringwethil** was a vampire of Sauron at Tol-in-Gaurhoth, during the First Age.

## Biography
The origins of Thuringwethil are untold. Her ability to change form suggests that she may have been an Ainu or a skin-changer.

Sometime before the Quest for the Silmaril, Thuringwethil became the messenger of Sauron at Tol-in-Gaurhoth, formerly Tol Sirion, often flying to Angband in the curséd

In the year 466, Lúthien disguised herself in Thuringwethil's vile

## Etymology
- Thuringwethil* was a Sindarin name in the Doriathren dialect, defined by J.R.R. Tolkien as "Woman of Secret Shadow" It should be pronounced *thu-ring-REH-thil*. It consists of the elements *thurin* ("secret, hidden"), *gwath* ("shadow, dim light"), and *-il* ("feminine suffix"), possibly causing an "affection" from *gwath* to *gweth*.

The Noldorin cognate of Thuringwethil was *Dolwethil*,

In *The Etymologies*, it is mentioned in the context of Tinúviel's disguise that Thuringwethil was "a bat-shaped fay". It is not clear if all vampires were fays or if only Thuringwethil was one. In the same passage, *Thuringwethil* is described as an Ilkorin name, spelled as ***Thurin-gwethil***; and though the meaning was still "(Woman of) Secret Shadow", its elements had different meanings: *thurin* ("guarded, hidden"),

### *Middle-earth Role Playing*
In the 1994 *Creatures of Middle-earth: A Bestiary of Animals and Monsters* supplement of the *Middle-earth Role Playing*, Thuringwethil was an Ainu who became Sauron's favorite messenger, gaining the title: **Messenger of Angband and Tol-in-Gaurhoth**. She possessed a magic cloak of shaping that allowed non-ainu people to shape-shift into a vampire. Eventually, when Tol-in-Gaurhoth fell to Lúthien and Huan, she somehow vanished, losing her powers when her cloak of shaping was taken by Lúthien, who later used it to sneak into Angband.
