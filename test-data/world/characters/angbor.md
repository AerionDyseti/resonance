# Angbor

**Angbor the Fearless** was the Lord of Lamedon at the time of the War of the Ring.

## History
On 11 March, , Angbor led the men of Lamedon in a fight against invaders from Umbar and Harad who sought to capture Linhir and the fords of the River Gilrain.  However, the battle halted and all the men of both sides fled upon the arrival of Aragorn with the Army of the Dead - all save Angbor who alone had the heart to face them.  Aragorn bade Angbor to gather his folk and follow him to Pelargir where "the Heir of Isildur will have need of you."

As Aragorn pressed on to Pelargir, Angbor mustered as many horsemen as he could, helped by the fast-spreading rumour of the return of the Heir of Isildur.  His force arrived at the riverside city on 13 March after the Shadow Host had cleared the ships.  Afterwards, as Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, the Grey Company, and the freed men of Gondor rowed north upon the Anduin, Angbor led his horsemen north by land.

In the debate on 16 March before the march to the Morannon, Imrahil expressed concern for the defence of Gondor.  Aragorn assured him that new strength was on the way, stating that Angbor, whom he named "the fearless", was marching with 4,000 men through Lossarnach.  Angbor's strength would be nearing Minas Tirith as Aragorn departed, thus leaving the city with a better defence than when the assault began.

## Etymology
- Angbor* is Sindarin for "Iron Fist", from *ang* ("iron") + *paur* ("fist, hand").

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Angbor is the Lord of Lamedon, ruling from the town of Calembel. During the War of the Ring he is charged by Prince Imrahil with protecting the land from the Corsairs of Umbar while other Lords of Gondor ride to the defence of Minas Tirith. Leaving his son Drambor in charge of Calembel, Angbor decides to make the stand against the Corsairs in Linhir where both sides except Angbor would flee before the Oathbreakers of Dunharrow. Angbor immediately recognises Aragorn as his King and after swearing loyalty to him, joins his host with the Grey Company, leading his men in the liberation of Pelargir. Before departing on the Corsair ships, Aragorn orders Angbor to march his men towards towards the White City and the player accompanies his men for a while on their way through Upper Lebennin and Lossarnach before parting ways. Angbor and his men arrive to Minas Tirith shortly after the Battle of Pelennor Fields is over, and while many of his men stay behind to protect the city, Angbor himself joins the Host of the West. He fights in and eventually survives the Battle of the Morannon.
