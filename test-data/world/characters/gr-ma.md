# Gríma

**Gríma Wormtongue** was the chief counsellor of King Théoden of Rohan and the son of Gálmód.

Upon Gandalf's second coming to Edoras, Gríma tried to discredit him, until the White Wizard managed to heal Théoden. After this, "many things which men had missed" were found locked in Gríma's trunk and he was given a grim choice: ride into battle with his liege and so prove his good faith or into exile. Choosing the latter, he went to dwell with Saruman at Orthanc, where he witnessed the disastrous Battle of Isengard. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, he mistakenly threw a "heavy rock"&mdash;which was actually the *palantír* of Orthanc&mdash;at either his master or the outsiders, for "he couldn't decide which he hated the most". Saruman seems to have punished him severely for this act.

While being held in Orthanc, Gríma became weak and thin and was subjected to Saruman's mistreatment of him. When Treebeard released him and Saruman in August, they left and headed west. On their way, they were confronted by Gandalf, Celeborn, Galadriel and the Hobbits on their way to northern Dunland. They found them as travelling beggars and Saruman kicked Gríma to move on, as he exclaimed how he hated his master. Galadriel told Gríma that he was free to leave him whenever he wished but he did not reply and he continued to follow the Wizard.

Saruman had already been exerting his control over the Shire from afar by sending evil Men there and puppeteering Lotho Sackville-Baggins's rise to power, thus the fallen Wizard sought his revenge in petty tyranny as "Sharkey" over the Hobbits who indirectly ensured his downfall. During this time Gríma became increasingly degraded until he was a crawling wretch, almost resembling Gollum, and Saruman shortened his nickname to "Worm" in derision. During this time he murdered the now-useless Lotho on his master's orders, and may have eaten him.

The return of Frodo Baggins and his companions to the Shire resulted in the Hobbits rallying against the brigands and overthrowing Sharkey. Spurred by the words of Frodo that he did not have to follow Saruman, and being pushed over the edge when Saruman scorned him yet again, Gríma used a hidden knife to slit the throat of his oppressor from behind and then darted down the road. He was quickly shot dead by several Hobbit arrows, and thus Wormtongue was the final casualty of the War of the Ring, an unhappy and short-lived wretch who sold his soul to the side of the Enemy and paid the price for his folly. According to Jim Allan this is a good name for a traitor who hides his true face as well as his lust for Éowyn.

- Wormtongue* is a modernised form of Old English *wyrm-tunge* ("snake-tongue").

## Genealogy

## Inspiration
J. Allard suggests that Gríma was based on or inspired by Unferth from *Beowulf*, a character that sits near King Hrothgar and serves as a taunter.

## Other versions of the legendarium
When initially conceived, the character is introduced as "a wizened [struck out: old] figure of a man with a pale wise face". While he is first named "Wormtongue", his "true name" is initially *Frána*.

'*1956: *The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series)*:**
:Bernard Rebel played Gríma.

**1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:Gríma Wormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon.

**1979: *The Lord of the Rings* (1979 radio series):**
:John Vickery played Gríma.
**1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):**
:Paul Brooke played Gríma.  He is introduced much earlier than in the book in excerpts from The Hunt for the Ring when he is questioned by the Nazgûl on his way to Isengard. His death at Bag End is also included in the final episode.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):**
:Gríma Wormtongue is played by Karl Lieffen.

**2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series):*'
:Gríma is played by Brad Dourif. The reason for Gríma's pale and emaciated appearance in the movie is not entirely clear. Perhaps it is meant to suggest that by throwing in his lot with Saruman he has started down the same path to physical and mental corruption that caused Gollum to become a twisted parody of his original self, although it is just as likely that Jackson simply wanted to make it clear that Wormtongue was one of the "bad guys" in what may seem a large and confusing cast of characters to the audience.

:The events of "The Scouring of the Shire" do not appear in the film version, so Saruman's death was moved to an earlier scene. Other than the location, which was moved to the Tower of Orthanc, the manner of their deaths is very much the same. As in the book, Gríma kills Saruman, but by stabbing him in the back, not slitting his throat. Saruman's body then falls from the tower and is impaled on a spiked wheel, one of the remnants of his infernal machines. Gríma himself is shot by an arrow fired by Legolas, thereby mirroring his death in the book. This scene was to have included a line where Saruman blamed Gríma for killing Théodred, replacing Lotho in the context of that scene, but the line was cut out.

'*2002-2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):**
:The voice of Gríma is provided by Ivan Gogál.
