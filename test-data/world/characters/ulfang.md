# Ulfang

**Ulfang**, also known as **Ulfang the Black**, was an Easterling chieftain of the First Age who followed Caranthir. His sons fought in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad but betrayed the Fëanorians and thus enabled the victory of Morgoth.

## Biography

Ulfang was among the "Swarthy Men" who had come out of the East into Beleriand. He swore allegiance to Caranthir but was secretly in the service of Morgoth. In the battle his men turned on the Sons of Fëanor. Their force, which was being attacked on three sides, was dissipated, allowing Morgoth to concentrate his forces on Fingon and Turgon. Ulfang's treacherous progeny, however, paid for their betrayal with their lives, for Uldor, Ulfast, and Ulwarth all perished in the battle.
