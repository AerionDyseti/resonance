# Angrod

**Angrod** was a Ñoldorin Elf, the second son of Finarfin and lord of the Ñoldor of Dorthonion. He was the father of Orodreth and subsequently grandfather of the famed Gil-galad.

## Biography
Angrod was the elder brother of Galadriel and Aegnor, and younger brother of Finrod Felagund. In FA 6, he was received in Doriath by King Thingol, requesting Thingol's permission to establish realms in Beleriand outside the king's realm.

With Aegnor, he held the northern slopes of the highlands of Dorthonion against Morgoth. Angrod and Aegnor were both killed in the Dagor Bragollach. 

He married a Ñoldorin lady named Eðellos. His son was Orodreth.

## Etymology
The name ***Angrod*** was a Sindarin form of his Telerin Quenya name, ***Angaráto***, which means "champion".

## Other versions
In , Orodreth is given as Angrod's brother instead. This was an editorial decision by Christopher Tolkien, which he later admitted as a mistake.
