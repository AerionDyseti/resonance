# Orodreth

**Orodreth** was a Ñoldorin Elf of the First Age who was the second ruler of the underground city of Nargothrond in western Beleriand. He was born to a Noldorin father, Finarfin, and a Telerin mother, Eärwen, in the city of Tirion during the Years of the Trees and was the brother of Finrod Felagund, Angrod, Aegnor and Galadriel. He was later killed in the Battle of Tumhalad.

However, according to later notes of Tolkien's, Orodreth was the son of Finarfin's son Angrod and Eðellos. Hence, this made Orodreth the grandson of Finarfin and *Eärwen* since he was Angrod's son, and he became the nephew of Finrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel. Orodreth's wife was a Sindarin lady of the North, and they had two children: Finduilas and Gil-galad.

## Biography
Through his grandmother (mother) Eärwen of the Falmari (Teleri of Aman), he shared the blood of both the Ñoldor (House of Finarfin) and that of the Falmari (House of Olwë). After the Doom of Mandos was announced in Araman, he and the rest of the Ñoldor left for Middle-earth. Even as his grandfather (father) Finarfin and many of his House turned back to Valinor, Orodreth stayed with his uncle Fingolfin and his host and pursued his journey to Middle-earth.

Orodreth once held the isle of Minas Tirith in the vale of Sirion until Sauron overran the isle and turned it into Tol-in-Gaurhoth. Orodreth then fled south to Nargothrond.

When Beren came to the Kingdom of Nargothrond, King Finrod went with him on his quest for the Silmaril. However, Celegorm and Curufin, the Sons of Fëanor, were also at Nargothrond, and forced Finrod to lay down his crown. Orodreth took it, ruling as regent, but the Sons of Fëanor held the real power. When news came that Finrod had been killed, the Sons of Fëanor were expelled from Nargothrond and Orodreth became its next king.

When Túrin Turambar arrived in Nargothrond he gradually became its leader and Orodreth held no actual power, even if he was still King in name. High in Orodreth's councils, Túrin convinced him to build the Bridge of Nargothrond and abandon their secretive method of warfare in favor of open warfare. In FA 495, Orodreth and Túrin marched out to meet the hosts of Morgoth and the Dragon Glaurung at Tumhalad and Orodreth died fighting there, and his realm was subsequently conquered.

## Etymology
The name ***Orodreth*** is Sindarin for "mountaineer", which came from the word *orod* ("mountain").

His name in Quenya was **Artaresto**, which appears to have come from the word *arta* ("fortress, high") and *resto*, which have originated from the word *retta* ("climber").

Interestingly, if the second part of his Quenyan name did come from *retta*, it is easily concievable that the second component of his Quenyan name *resto* was converted into *reth* when translated into Sindarin, hence "mountaineer", or more literally in this case, "mountain climber".

### Genealogy
In *The Silmarillion*, Orodreth is a son of Finarfin, with the Quenya name **Artanáro**. This was an editorial decision by Christopher Tolkien, made on the grounds that the later revision was not fully integrated into the extant texts by his father. Gil-galad, later High King of the Ñoldor, was his son, but in *The Silmarillion*, Gil-galad is made into Fingon's son instead. An earlier idea was that Orodreth's son was named **Hallas**, but Gil-galad replaced him.

As the son of Angrod, the earlier name for Orodreth was Artanáro and later changed to Artaresto. After Angrod was slain, Orodreth dwelt with Finrod and became his "steward".

In his last writings, Tolkien changed Orodreth's name to **Artaher** (Quenya) or **Arothir** (Sindarin), but it was never introduced in any narratives, so Christopher Tolkien left the name *Orodreth* unchanged. It is probable the Sindarin name Orodreth would have been retained nonetheless: Tolkien seldom changed names after they had long been used, even if only in unpublished writings.
