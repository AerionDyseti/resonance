# Gollum

**Gollum**, also known as **Sméagol**, was a creature (originally a Stoorish Hobbit) who bore the One Ring. He lived in the Misty Mountains for most of his life. In  he lost the Ring to Bilbo Baggins. For the rest of his life he sought to recover his "precious" "birthday present". In  he followed the Fellowship of the Ring and met Frodo Baggins. After leading Frodo into Mordor and betraying him to Shelob he finally seized the Ring in Sammath Naur. In his euphoria he died and destroyed the Ring after falling into the fires of Mount Doom.

## History
### Early life
Sméagol was a Hobbit of riverland Stoor-kind who lived on the banks of the Anduin in the later Third Age. Sméagol belonged to the reputable family of the stern and wise matriarch. He also knew the riddle-game, and riddles that were known to their cousins in the Shire.

Around the year , on his birthday, his friend (and close relative) Déagol offered him a cheap present. Later that day they went boating in the Gladden Fields, and as Sméagol was nosing at the banks, Déagol was pulled into the water by a large fish, and found a gold ring. Sméagol demanded the ring as a birthday present and strangled Deágol when he refused, and hid his body.

After this event, he returned home and understood he was invisible. He kept his treasure a secret and used it in malicious ways, to see and hear secrets and hurtful things. and was corrupted further by the ring. Soon he became unpopular and his peers avoided him; they often cursed and kicked him, and he bit their feet. Becoming a loner, he muttered to himself and gurgled in his throat, for which they called him *gollum*, and he survived by stealing. Eventually even his grandmother, desiring peace, banished him from their family and hobbit-hole.

### Into the wild
He stayed two more years in the Mountains although he was disgusted by the empty night, nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He hated darkness, light and the Ring most of all, but his addiction to it was so great that he overcame his hatred and fear of the light and the Orcs. He left and pursued Bilbo,

### War of the Ring
In June of , Orcs raided the Elves of Mirkwood (in an obviously coordinated attack) allowing Gollum to escape. He resumed his search of the Ring and presumably, he decided to hide into Moria in August, in order to lose his pursuers, the Elves and the servants of Sauron. However he could not open the Doors of Durin from the inside so didn't exit into Eriador to reach the Shire. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to Gollum, and all hope of redemption was lost. Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into Shelob's Lair. For this service to Shelob, the Orcs of Cirith Ungol knew Gollum as "Her Sneak".

Just as Frodo warned him, Gollum's betrayal of his oath ultimately led to his undoing, for Frodo and Sam escaped from Shelob's lair and came against all odds to the volcano Mount Doom. Gollum followed them all the way, seeking a chance to surprise them and take the Ring. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, he attacked, but failed to get the Ring. Sam, who had hated Gollum on sight, tried to bring himself to kill him, but relented out of sheer pity and disgust, turning his back on the beaten creature.

Moments later, Frodo was standing on the edge of the Cracks of Doom, but, unwilling to destroy the Ring, claimed it for himself and put it on. Then Gollum attacked again. The two fought whilst Frodo was invisible and finally Gollum bit off Frodo's finger.

Here Frodo's kindness in sparing Gollum's life was rewarded, for Gollum then teetered on the edge of the great pit, lost his balance and fell in, taking the Ring and finger with him with a last cry of "Preciouss!". Had Gollum not lived to play this final part, there would have been a good chance that Sauron would have regained the Ring, as he knew where Frodo was as soon as he put the Ring on.

## Characteristics
### Appearance
left|thumb|*The Stairs of Cirith Ungol* by Peter Xavier Price
Sméagol was a Hobbit, but he spent long centuries in darkness and damp, influenced by the power of the Ring. It is possible that thanks to his hardy Hobbitish nature that he was not reduced to a wraith. However, he was reduced to a small, extremely thin and wiry person, with scrawny neck, pale skin, flat feet, long thin hands with clammy fingers, and large pale or green eyes that seemed to glow. His sense of sight, as well as his hearing and smelling, was very good, due to the time he spent underground.

He could move and climb silently like a spider, and although he had only six teeth left, he could give deep bites, even able to bite off Frodo's finger.

### Personality
Sméagol was quick and strong, the most inquisitive and curious-minded of his community. He was interested in roots and beginnings. He owed his name to his interest in roots and deep pools; he dove, burrowed and tunnelled under trees, plants, and mounds. He tended to neglect anything that was higher, like the flowers, the trees and looking at the hills. He then came to use Slinker and Stinker to refer to the two contrasting sides of Gollum's personality, Slinker was the fawning, desperate, and eager-to-please, "Sméagol" side demeanour; and Stinker was the plotting and sinister "Gollum" side of him. When he first came into the service of Frodo Baggins his Slinker side was more prominent but the closer they got to the Black Gate the more the Stinker side started to take over and Slinker became more like Stinker and Sam started using the name to generally refer to Gollum.

Other aspects of the Ring's corruption was the aversion to all living creatures, especially the Elves and all things Elven. The Elven rope burnt his skin, and lembas tasted like dust to him and choked him.

Sméagol, as a Hobbit, was perhaps good at heart, but he was relatively greedy and mean.

## Etymology

- Sméagol* is the translation of an actual Westron name *Trahald*, the meaning of which was "burrowing, worming in" or "apt to creep into a hole". In both Westron and Old English, Sméagol's name is related to Smaug's: Smaug's name in "true Dalish" was *Trāgu*, and the *Trah-* stem in *Trahald* and *Trâgu* is thus an analogue of the Germanic stem present in both *Sméagol* and *Smaug*.

Tolkien explained in his "Guide to the Names in *The Lord of the Rings*" the origin of the name *Sméagol* in the lemma on smials:

The name *Smaug*, which means "squeezed through a hole", is thus related.

### Pronunciation

In both the 1981 BBC radio adaptation and in Peter Jackson's films *Sméagol* is pronounced as "SMEE-gol", although the placement of the acute accent suggests that the correct pronunciation is "SMAY-uh-gol". On the other hand, in Tolkien's recordings of *The Lord of the Rings* he also pronounced it "SMEE-gol" or "SMEE-AH-GOL", suggesting that *éa* should either be pronounced as a long "i"-sound or as a diphthong *ea*, and not as two distinct vowels "e" and "a". Tolkien had a habit in his writing to put diacritics in varying places, as can also be seen in the name *Eärendil*, which also occurs spelt *Ëarendil*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the first edition of *The Hobbit*, Gollum did not appear quite as wretched or as bound to the Ring. Tolkien revised this characterisation to fit the concept of the Ruling Ring developed during the writing of *The Lord of the Rings*. Tolkien then explained the version given in the first edition as a lie that Bilbo made up to tell the Dwarves and Gandalf.

In *The Silmarillion*, it is mentioned that the One Ring was found "*ere the Kings failed in Gondor*". This can mean that originally, Gollum's age was intended to be considerably more than six hundred years (further reinforced by certain places in *The Lord of the Rings* like Gollum referring to tales about an uncorrupted Minas Ithil or Gandalf comparing his people to "fathers of the fathers of the Stoors"). In fact it seems likely that Sauron leaving the Mirkwood in 2063 T.A. and some Hobbits settling there after that are details added for the purpose of making the smaller age possible; perhaps in order to make it possible for Gollum and the other characters to have the same language.

## Inspiration
John Garth has suggested that the character of Gollum carries echoes of the "*night-haunting, man-eating*" ogre Grendel in *Beowulf*.

### Films
'*1977: *The Hobbit* (1977 film):**
:Gollum is a frog-like green creature, voiced by Brother Theodore. Here, his "Gollum" noise sounds like muttering instead of swallowing.

**1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:Gollum is depicted as a skinny, dark grey creature, voiced by Peter Woodthorpe. 

**1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):*'
:Brother Theodore reprised his role from the earlier Rankin/Bass production. Some footage from *The Hobbit* was reused to introduce the viewer to the story. 

'*2001-03: *The Lord of the Rings* (film series):*'
:Gollum is a CGI-motion capture creature voiced by actor Andy Serkis. He is barely glimpsed in *The Fellowship of the Ring*, where he is voiced by Dominic Monaghan in absence of Serkis. Gollum becomes a central character in *The Two Towers* and *The Return of the King*. The ground-breaking CGI character was built around Serkis's voice, movements and expressions, sometimes by using a motion capture suit which recorded his movements and applied them to the digital character, and sometimes by the more laborious process of digitally "painting out" Serkis's image and replacing it with Gollum's. In one such shot in *The Two Towers*, Serkis' real spittle can be seen emerging from Gollum's mouth.

:In *The Return of the King* Serkis himself appears in a flashback scene as Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for *The Two Towers* but held back because it was felt that audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Gollum's face had to be redesigned for the second and third movies so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'.

**2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey:**
:Andy Serkis reprised his role as Gollum.

### Television
'*1993: *Hobitit*:**

**1968: *The Hobbit* (1968 radio series):*'
:The narrator refers to Gollum (voiced by Wolfe Morris) as "Galloom", even though Gollum himself manages to pronounce his name correctly. Gollum's role is based on that of the second edition of *The Hobbit*.

'*1979: *The Lord of the Rings* (1979 radio series):**
:Gail Chugg provided the voice of Gollum.

**1980: *Der Hobbit* (1980 German radio series):**

### Games
**1982: *The Hobbit (1982 video game)***
:Gollum appears in the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. He will persistently speak riddles to Bilbo, and strangle him to death if he fails to answer them in time. However, if Bilbo puts the Ring on, then Gollum will not be able to see him. He can also be killed by Bilbo or his companions, even though doing so would seriously conflict with established canon.
**2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):'''
:Gollum, voiced by Quinton Flynn, is seen thrice: first, in the introduction scene, he is stooping over his precious, dashing away from the camera. He is a creature in colour and clothing much like Jackson's version. He is briefly glimpsed again in Moria, but not more than a dark shape with a green outline can be seen. His most important role is in the final stages of the game: he can be seen atop several ridges, and can even be visited on a rock on the shores of Nen Hithoel. He throws a fish, the "Xiphiidae", at "Ranger". This will become the most deadly weapon in the game, and replaces Andúril in the weapon slots. 

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* (video game):**
:Gollum is accompanying Sam and Frodo during Osgiliath mission and the is the final boss of the game at the Crack of Doom. Unlike all other enemies of the game, he takes no damage from any attacks - instead the players must perform combinations to push him into lava below.

**2003: *Sierra's The Hobbit*:*'
:Gollum appears in a cut scene after the level "Riddles in the Dark". Only Bilbo's last riddle - "*What have I got in my pocket?*" - is shown, after which Gollum spouts out all possible answers in one sentence rather than in three turns. Gollum is a dark grey, hobbit-like creature with seven spiky teeth, who walks on all fours like an ape would, and like his Rankin/Bass counterpart, his "Gollum" noise is a muttering instead of a swallowing. He is voiced by Daran Norris.

:Gollum is a "Hero" unit for the Servants of the Enemy, used primarily for scout missions.

**2004: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth*:**
:Gollum is a "Hero" for the Mordor factions. His health is extremely low and his attacks extremely weak, but has value for the scout missions.

**2006: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II*:**
:In non-storyline battles, stealthed Gollum is roaming the map. If detected and killed, he drops The One Ring, which can give huge advantage to the side that gets it.

**2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:**
:Gollum is encountered thrice, though the player has yet to know his name. The first time he is met in southern Trollshaws, where the player prevents him from attacking the baby of two Fishermen; the second time he is seen in southern Mirkwood, where the player must defeat the Orcs who attempts to capture him, the third time is on the Shores of Anduin, where the player has to make sure he does not fall prey to the spiders.

**2012: *Guardians of Middle-earth*:*'
:Gollum is a striker-type "guardian" with four abilities: *Throttle*, *My Precious*, *Coward* and *We are starved*.

'*2014: *Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor*:*'
:Gollum is featured in the game as a supporting character. In the game, set between *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*, Gollum is searching for the One Ring and encounters Talion, the protagonist of the game and helps him in his Quest.

'*2017: *Middle-earth: Shadow of War*:**
