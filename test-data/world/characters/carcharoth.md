# Carcharoth

**Carcharoth** was bred from the foul breed of Draugluin, the first Werewolf, and fed with elvish and mannish flesh by Morgoth himself. He was the greatest, most powerful wolf to ever live. Carcharoth was set as a guard on the Gates of Angband, and later he mortally wounded both Huan, the Hound of Valinor, and Beren.

## History
After hearing of the Fall of Tol-in-Gaurhoth, where Huan had defeated Draugluin and Sauron, Morgoth decided to create a werewolf to kill Huan, who could only be killed by the greatest wolf to have ever lived. Carcharoth became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril when Beren and Lúthien had to pass him on their way into Angband. He stopped them, suspicious of Draugluin, (Beren in disguise) as he had heard of Draugluin's death. Lúthien enchanted him with her magic, but on their way out Carcharoth attacked before Lúthien could enchant him again. Beren held out the captured Silmaril in an attempt to stay the beast, but Carcharoth bit off Beren's hand at the wrist with Silmaril and all.

The Silmaril burnt away Carcharoth's insides, and he became crazed with pain. A terror to Eldar, Men and Orcs alike, he passed south through Beleriand, consumed with an overpowering thirst. From this comes his name of **Anfauglir**, meaning 'Jaws of Thirst'. He arrived in Doriath where Beren, King Thingol, Beleg Cúthalion and Mablung joined with Huan the Hound in the Hunting of the Wolf.

At last, he was discovered within the borders of Doriath itself, where he fought his last fight with Huan: the wolf and the hound took one another's lives in that combat. 

Both Beren and Huan were mortally wounded. When Mablung cut open the belly of the beast, he found there the Silmaril with Beren's hand still around it, but when he touched the flesh it was no more. or carch ("fang"). Based on the above, perhaps the name can be analyzed into the unattested words **carn* (an alternate version of *caran*) and **caroth* ("maw"), the latter ending with the augmentative suffix *-oth* also seen in *Nogoth* "(Big) Dwarf" = *naug* + *oth* ("maw" = "big jaw").

Note that the final letter of *car(a)**n*** + the initial letter of ***c**arach/oth-* produce the sound **ch** (IPA: ) with the phenomenon called nasal mutation.

His later name *Anfauglir*, is probably composed of Sindarin *and* ("long") + *faug* ("thirst") + *lîr* ("jaws").

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
Originally Carcharoth's name was ***Karkaras***, the Knife-fang, who was the father of wolves. He was a great grey wolf.

***Borosaith*** meaning "Everhungry" is another name for Carcharoth, and it is said to be used in old songs.

## Inspiration
For the creation of Carcharoth, Tolkien was clearly influenced by the wolf Fenrir in Norse mythology, who bit off  Týr's hand, and was also tormented by ceaseless pains.
