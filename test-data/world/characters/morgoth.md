# Morgoth

**Melkor** (Quenya: "He who arises in might"), commonly known as **Morgoth **(Sindarin: "Black Foe of the World"), was the rebel Vala, the first Dark Lord, and the primordial source of evil in Eä in the Elder Days. He coveted Arda and all that it contained, but when he was rejected in his lordship by his fellow Ainur, he sought instead to destroy, corrupt or pervert all that which they would create or steward. Defying the will of his creator, Ilúvatar, and sowing discord among the Ainur, Melkor would be at the root of virtually all the misfortunes which befell Eä and those who dwelt within it.

The First Age and preceding eras saw him destroy many works of the Valar, such as the Two Lamps and Two Trees of Valinor, and clash with the Ñoldor for his theft of the Silmarils, leading to Melkor being renamed as Morgoth. However, eventually defeated by the Host of Valinor in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, Morgoth was banished from Middle-earth into the Timeless Void, though some believe that he will one day return for Dagor Dagorath. Regardless, his will remains as a part of Arda even after his physical expulsion, a whisper in the hearts of Elves and Men that would turn to evil those who heed it. 

## Biography

### Ainulindalë
Melkor was created by Eru Ilúvatar in the Timeless Halls at the beginning of creation; he was greater in power and knowledge than the other Ainur. His brother was Manwë.

Impatient with the emptiness of the Void outside the Timeless Halls, and desiring to create things of his own, he often entered the Void seeking the Airefëa, but the Flame was of Ilúvatar and an aspect of his being, and as such Melkor never discovered it. Melkor continued to search, however, and as such was often alone and apart from his fellow Ainur. It was during these lonesome periods that he began to have ideas and thoughts that were not in accordance with his fellow Ainur.

When the Ainur sang the Great Music before Eru, he wove some of these alien thoughts into his music, and straightaway a Discord arose around him. Some of those nearby attuned their music to his, until two musical themes were warring before the Throne. To correct the Discord, Eru introduced a Second theme, of which Manwë was the chief instrument. However Melkor succeeded in overwhelming it, and the Discord grew worse. Eru then introduced a Third theme, which was wholly apart from the Ainur. This was the theme of Elves and Men, a musical representation of the natures of the Children of Ilúvatar. While this Third theme was not snuffed out by the discord as the Second theme was, it too failed to correct it. By this point, Melkor's discord had grown so prominent that many of the Ainur had simply ceased their song altogether, and Eru rose from his throne with a terrible countenance to bring the music to an end.

Following this, he rebuked Melkor, praising his strength but reminding him that, as an aspect of his creator's thought, anything that he could bring into being ultimately had its source within Eru himself. As such, even the Discord would redound in the end to the glory of Eru's work. This rebuke shamed Melkor and brought with it a secret anger. Thereafter, Eru revealed the Music to have been the pattern through which his Creation was to manifest. So when he incarnated Music as Arda, it was already flawed through the Discord, and immoderate heat and great cold stalked it. Melkor then took in the interest of the World and descended to it with the other Valar. To defend it, he raised the Iron Mountains as a ring around the north. Decay arose in the North, and the Valar thus knew that Melkor had returned. Before they could begin to search for him however, Melkor came forth from Utumno with sudden war, and cast down the Lamps. They broke upon the ground and the fire within them was loosed upon Middle-earth, scorching much of it. The efforts of the Valar to mitigate the destruction of this event kept them occupied long enough for Melkor and his forces to retreat to Utumno. The Valar attempted to assault Utumno after Melkor's retreat, but too much of their attention was given to mitigating the catastrophe of the Lamps for the attack to be effective.

After the destruction of the Lamps and the subsequent ruination of much of Middle-earth, the Valar withdrew to the continent of Aman and there built Valinor. In doing so however, they gave Melkor essentially free rein in Middle-earth. As a result, the continent languished in darkness, and Melkor filled its lands with terrible creatures and decay. During this time, Melkor built his second, lesser fortress of Angband in the west, as a defense in the West should the Valar attack. Angband was delved into the Iron Mountains, and was given to Sauron to command. 

The Valar during this period were reluctant to wage any renewed war against Melkor, as they remained unsure of where and when the Children of Ilúvatar would awaken. They feared that, should the Children awaken unnoticed during another world-breaking clash, they would surely be destroyed. Indeed, given how terribly the world had been devastated by the breaking of the Lamps, they were no longer certain that the Children would awake at all. As such, most of them remained in Aman and forsook Middle-earth, with only Ulmo and Oromë attempting to maintain a presence there. Due to this, Melkor discovered the Elves before the other Valar. Bitter over his inability to create life in the manner of Ilúvatar, Melkor captured many of the newly awakened Elves and, out of spite, transformed them by torture and other foul craft into the first Orcs. Of all the evils he committed, this was said to have been his most terrible, and his most hateful to Ilúvatar.

### First Age
#### Chaining of Melkor in Valinor
When the birthplace of the newly created Elves was discovered by the Vala Oromë, the Valar took immediate action against Melkor, instigating the War of the Powers. The Valar quickly leveled Angband and met Melkor and his forces in battle. The Valar were victorious, and Melkor and his remaining servants retreated back into Utumno. After a grievous siege there, the Valar rent its doors open, entered, and captured him. Melkor was bound with Angainor and brought back to Valinor. There, he pled for pardon, but was cast into the Halls of Mandos for three Ages. However, in their haste to overthrow Melkor, the Valar left many of Utumno's pits and vaults unexplored, and Sauron remained at large. Additionally, they did not capture or destroy the Balrogs, who gathered at the ruins of Angband and went into a long hibernation, awaiting Melkor's return.

Shortly after Fëanor's death Morgoth sent an embassy to the Ñoldor offering a truce, and even promising a Silmaril. Maedhros, Fëanor's heir, agreed to the parley, but both sides expected treachery and arrived with greater force than was agreed upon. Unfortunately for the Elves, Morgoth's force was the greater of the two, and was accompanied by Balrogs. The Elven company was quickly slain with the exception of Maedhros, who was captured. Many of them settled in the north of Beleriand and befriended the Sindar and Ñoldor already established there. The Elves found these Men to be exceptionally hardy, and they would often aid the Elves by perform scouting and reconnaissance of Angband in the most inhospitable areas imaginable.

#### Dagor Bragollach

About 455 years after Fingolfin came to Middle-earth, Morgoth deemed that the time was ripe to destroy the Elves and their allies. One cold winter night, when the Elven watch was least vigilant, Morgoth sent forth terrible rivers of fire and lava from Thangorodrim and poisonous fumes from the Iron Mountains. The Elves were completely unprepared for such an assault, and a great many Ñoldor perished on the Ard-galen as the fires consumed it and transformed it into a lifeless wasteland, forever after known as the Anfauglith. In the wake of these fires there came Glaurung, now fully grown, the Balrogs, and armies of Orcs and other monsters in numbers such as the Elves had never conceived of. Thus began the Dagor Bragollach. The Siege of Angband was broken and the forces of the Elves and their allies were scattered. So swift and overwhelming was Morgoth's assault that the various Elven kingdoms were unable to marshal their forces in any sort of unified front, and as such Morgoth was able to engage the Elven forces in a piecemeal fashion, greatly blunting the effectiveness of any resistance.

The battle went disastrously for the Elves. With the exception of Maedhros and his fortress upon the hill of Himring, the sons of Fëanor and Finarfin were overthrown and utterly defeated. Fingolfin and Fingon only just barely managed to defend Hithlum from Morgoth's onslaught, as the mountains surrounding it provided an effective barrier against Morgoth's fires. The Elves were completely driven from the forests of Dorthonion, and many of the Sindar forsook the war altogether and went to Doriath. When news came to Fingolfin of the totality of Morgoth's triumph, a great despair came upon him. Believing the Ñoldor to have been defeated beyond any hope of recovery, he rode forth alone from Hithlum in a wrath so potent that he was said to have resembled Oromë himself. His rage was so terrible that even Morgoth's mightiest servants dared not trouble him even as he rode to the very gates of Angband. There he smote upon the doors of Morgoth's fortress and challenged the Dark Lord to come forth to single combat. Morgoth did not wish to do so, as though he was said still to be the "mightiest of all things in this world", he alone of the Valar knew fear. But Fingolfin's challenge was heard by all of Angband, and was given in such an insulting manner that to ignore it would have been to lose face before his captains.

Morgoth issued forth in black armor from Angband to confront Fingolfin. Wielding the terrible hammer Grond, Morgoth repeatedly attempted to smite the Elven king, but succeeded only in carving many fiery pits in the ground from his missed strikes. Fingolfin long managed to avoid Morgoth's blows, and wounded the Dark Lord seven times. But at last Fingolfin grew weary, and Morgoth battered Fingolfin with his enormous shield, which thrice drove the Elven king to his knees. Fingolfin arose each time to continue the fight, but eventually he stumbled backwards into one of the many pits formed by Morgoth's missed attacks. Morgoth then set his foot upon Fingolfin's neck and killed him, but not before Fingolfin, with his last stroke, hewed Morgoth's foot with his sword. Then Morgoth broke Fingolfin's body and prepared to feed it to his wolves. But Thorondor, the King of the Eagles, swooped down upon Morgoth, marred his face with his talons, and retrieved the body of the elf-king.

All Morgoth's court was cast down in slumber by her song, but the Silmarils burned brightly, and Morgoth himself grew weary. The Iron Crown, to him, suddenly felt as a tremendous burden, and his head sagged upon his chest. Lúthien's spell then at last overcame him. His sleeping form toppled from his throne, and the Iron Crown rolled away from him. Beren then cut a Silmaril from it with the knife Angrist. However, rather than leaving immediately with his prize, Beren thought to take all three jewels. But as he attempted to pry the second loose, his knife snapped. One shard struck Morgoth's face, and he began to awaken, and with him all of Angband. Beren and Lúthien fled in terror, but without pursuit, as the whole of Angband was only stirring. At the gates however, Carcharoth had just recovered from Lúthien's previous spell, and barred the lovers' escape. Lúthien's efforts in putting Morgoth to sleep had left her too weakened to cast another spell, but Beren held forth the Silmaril, and attempted to use it to frighten Carcharoth into stepping aside. Carcharoth was undaunted however and bit off Beren's hand at the wrist, ingesting both it and the Silmaril it held. Burning from the inside at the touch of the holy jewel, Carcharoth went mad and fled in wrath from Angband, slaughtering all who stood in his path. Then Morgoth awoke, and in a rage he and his court roared up in pursuit, only to see Thorondor carrying off the raiders. Morgoth's fury at the loss of the Silmaril caused the Iron Mountains to begin erupting, terrifying all those who bore witness to the cataclysmic upheaval. Ultimately however, Morgoth was unable to recover the gem.

#### The Cursing of Húrin
Morgoth was also well known for the imprisonment of Húrin of the House of Hador during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. In the last hours of the battle, Húrin and his kin defended Turgon, for he was the last heir of the house of Fingolfin after Fingon fell in the battle. Turgon narrowly escaped the clutches of the host of Orcs due to the valor of Húrin, Huor, and their men.

Unfortunately, all but Húrin fell after the onslaught of Morgoth's forces. After slaying untold numbers of Trolls and Orcs single-handedly, Húrin was captured by Gothmog and taken to Angband. Morgoth knew that Húrin had been to Gondolin, and therefore knew the city's location. He sought to extract the information from him. Lungorthin, the lesser Lord of Balrogs and the second most mighty of the fire demons, smote Hurin across the mouth with a whistling whip. Despite inflicting terrible torment upon his captive, Lungorthin and in turn Morgoth were unsuccessful in gaining any answers.  

As punishment, Morgoth took Húrin to a pinnacle of Thangorodrim and placed him upon a chair. There, he bound Húrin with his power, and laid a curse upon him and his family. Húrin's son and daughter, Túrin and Niënor, would be followed everywhere they went by Morgoth's thought, which would ultimately turn their circumstances always to the worst of all outcomes. By this means he drove them at last to madness and despair; though there is doubt as to whether in the extremity of his malice he cheated himself, as their madness saved them from damnation.

Then, continuing his curse, he said:

Húrin himself was cursed in this way by Morgoth as well, but imprisoned atop Thangorodrim, the curse would be inactive, as Húrin could go nowhere and do nothing. In the interim, Morgoth linked Húrin's sight to his own, allowing him to witness, by way of Morgoth's quasi-omnipresent awareness, as his homelands fell into darkness, and his family despaired and died. Túrin, who was valiant and powerful, nearly escaped the curse, as was feared by Morgoth, but in the end could not. He and his sister Niënor perished. Thus, the curse of Morgoth on the Children of Húrin was fulfilled.

#### Fall of Gondolin
It was said that Morgoth hated and feared the House of Fingolfin most among the Houses of the sons of Finwë, especially Fingolfin's son Turgon, as it was prophesied that his doom would come from the House of Turgon. Following Turgon's escape from the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Morgoth sought to find and destroy the last of the free kingdoms of the Ñoldor; Gondolin, where Turgon reigned.

For 27 years, Húrin remained imprisoned atop Thangorodrim; forced to watch as his family, people, and lands fell into utter ruin at the hand of Morgoth. Though Morgoth was never able to force Húrin to reveal Gondolin's location, Morgoth eventually chose to release him. His stated reason was that of pity to an utterly defeated foe, but of course, this was not true. Rather, Morgoth's intention was for the cursed Húrin to bring further woe upon those who opposed him. Húrin, for his part, was not fooled by Morgoth's ruse but he took his freedom regardless, and left Angband forever. Eventually, Húrin made his way to the vale of Sirion and there, he cried out for Turgon, begging him for help. However, Turgon was too long in deciding whether to send emissaries to Húrin, and by the time he had made up his mind, Húrin had gone. However, the damage was done, as Húrin had been under watch by Morgoth's spies since his release. The Dark Lord was now aware of Gondolin's general location, and he flooded the vale with his spies in the hope that he might capture a wayward citizen of Gondolin. 

Several years later, Morgoth's hope was fulfilled. Maeglin, sister-son of Turgon, left the protection of Gondolin against Turgon's orders to scout for ore. He was captured by Morgoth's creatures and brought to Angband. Threatened with unimaginable torment, Maeglin offered the secrets of Gondolin's defenses in exchange for his own well-being. Delighted, Morgoth secured Maeglin's genuine loyalty by promising him the rule of Gondolin, and more importantly, the hand of Turgon's daughter Idril. Having lusted after Idril for decades, Maeglin became the Dark Lord's willing servant. After learning all he could from Maeglin, Morgoth sent him back to Gondolin to aid the invasion from within when the time came.

Soon after, Morgoth assailed Gondolin. With Maeglin's treacherous information, Morgoth's forces advanced upon the city nearly undetected, during a time of festival and over the mountains where the watch was least vigilant. By the time the Elves realized their peril, the city was beleaguered beyond hope by Morgoth's overwhelmingly superior forces, and quickly fell.

With the sacking of Gondolin and the defeat of the Ñoldor and their allies, Morgoth's long-sought triumph was complete.

Morgoth was utterly defeated, and he fled into the deepest of his mines and sued for peace and pardon. However, his plea went unheard, and the Valar crippled him and cast him upon his face. He was bound with the chain Angainor, his Iron Crown was beaten into a collar for his neck, and he was taken from the Earth and thrust through the Door of Night into the Timeless Void, outside Time and Space and outside Eä altogether, ultimately marking the end of the First Age. The two remaining Silmarils were recovered from him, though shortly thereafter they were again lost.

### Legacy and prophesied return

Morgoth's lies, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men, would continue to sprout in new, changing ways. Sauron, however, like Morgoth, was utterly defeated. 

Morgoth's taint of Arda was more than symbolic as, like the One Ring with Sauron, Morgoth dispersed a great portion of his essence into Middle-earth and like the Sauron's Ring, Arda became the physical container for Morgoth's spirit/will. While the Dark Lord lost a great deal of strength infusing his essence into the world so he could increase his hold over the world, it also meant that even banished, his malevolence would still permeate everything and corrupt the creatures of the world. There are even hints in Tolkien's writings and notes that Morgoth could even reach out from the Void and make his voice heard like a silent whisper tempting the Children of Eru towards evil or at the least his essence acted like an echo and similarly to the Sauron's Ring had its own dark will that served Morgoth's ends in his stead.

### Dagor Dagorath
According to material in some of Tolkien's writings compiled (but not published) by his son, in the last days Morgoth will learn how to break the Door of Night and re-enter the World, and initiate the Dagor Dagorath, the Battle of Battles. In this battle Morgoth himself would be slain by Túrin Turambar, returned to life or by Eönwë as written in *The Hiding of Valinor*. Thus the Children of Húrin and all Men will be avenged.

However,  as published does not include this information, and instead asserts that, if the Valar know how the end of Arda will occur, they have not revealed it.

## Etymology
The name ***Melkor*** is Quenya, meaning "One who arises in Might"; his name in Sindarin was **Belegûr** or **Belegurth** ("Great Death").

The name ***Morgoth***, given by Fëanor at Valmar after Melkor stole the Silmarils, meant "Dark Enemy", even though it was "**Black Foe of the World**" that Fëanor named him out loud. He was also known as **Melkor Bauglir** when he returned to Angband; *bauglir* meant "the Constrainer".

### Other names
Melkor was the world's first **Dark Lord**, and sometimes gave himself titles such as **King of the World**, Sador called him "**Black King**", and Amlach "**Master of Lies**". Before his defeat in the Battle of the Powers, fearful Elves of Cuiviénen called Melkor the **Dark Hunter**.

****Bauglir***, (S. "the Constrainer") given after his return to Angband at the beginning of the First Age. It was often combined with the name *Morgoth* to become the full title *Morgoth Bauglir*.
****Belegûr*** (S. "he who arises in might") or ***Belegurth*** ("Great Death")
***Black Hand**, called thus by Beleg
***Black King**
***Dark King**, given by Edain
***Dark Lord**
***Dark Power of the North**
***Elder King**, title of Manwë, claimed by Morgoth when speaking to Húrin
***Great Enemy**, used once by Aragorn
***King of the World**, given by himself after his return to Middle-earth
***Lord of All** and **Giver of Freedom**, used by Sauron when he encouraged Ar-Pharazôn to worship Melkor
***Lord of the Dark**, given by Edain
***Lord of the Darkness**, used by Sauron when he encouraged Ar-Pharazôn to worship Melkor
***Master of Lies**, given by Amlach
***Master of the fates of Arda**, used by him when speaking to Húrin.
**Melko, Belcha, Melegor, Melekō*, earlier forms of his Elvish names.

### In earlier stages
As shown in , Tolkien had named him **Melko** (most often), **Belcha** (from the Quenya *velka *meaning 'flame'), **Ulban(d)** ("monster"), **Melegor**, and **Meleko**, from the Primitive Quendian term *melek*, "great, mighty, powerful".

Material in  refers to Melkor as **Melko**, **Alkar**, and **Mardello**.

His Old English name is once given, ***Manfréa Bolgen***, from Old English words *man* ("evil, wickedness"), *fréa* ("lord"), and *bolgen* ("wrathful").

## Powers & abilities

Melkor was initially the strongest being of Arda, second only to Eru Ilúvatar. In his prime, he spilled oceans and destroyed mountain ranges. While Eru had blessed the other Valar with a portion of his thoughts and insights, making each absolute in their respective specialties, Melkor was blessed with greater power and a wider breadth of knowledge. However, he did not know all and never realized that Airefëa was a power to create that belonged solely to Eru.

Though tremendously powerful, able to alter or transform the world in many ways, Melkor could only twist or corrupt what already existed, not create anything new. In his desire to take control of all Arda, he dispersed his essence and power throughout the world to the point that Arda as a whole was corrupted, and even after his banishment, his evil would continue to plague the world by corrupting men and making the gift of immortality unbearable for the Elves. The more he dispersed his power throughout Arda, the more control he had over it.

Even while greatly weakened, Melkor could create massive firestorms, huge craters, and curse his foes to sorrow and death (e.g. the family of Húrin), though, the diminishing of his power was to his disadvantage in times such as his struggle with the empowered Ungoliant.

## Character

Of all of the Valar, none were so unique as Melkor and it was this uniqueness that ultimately played a part in his descent into rebellion against Eru and evil over all of Arda. All of the Valar were created from the largest portions of Eru's knowledge and awareness making them highest among the Ainur. They were powerful entities born from the concepts and ideas within Eru's mind. The concepts they were created from heavily influenced their personalities. Tulkas created from the concept war and combat making him courageous and hot tempered while Mandos born from the concept of death and inevitability was grim and stoic. However, Melkor was created from the largest portion of knowledge Eru manifested and was imbued with the knowledge of many concepts. He alone was the closest to Eru in power and shared in all of the knowledge the other Valar possessed. Eru had made Melkor to be the most independent of the Valar with the most personal agency. This had the result of isolating Melkor from his brothers and sisters as he had no peers and could see and understand more than any of the other Valar individually. This led to Melkor spending large periods of time alone in the void with his thoughts. The defining trait of Melkor was to be the ultimate outsider and always apart from others.

In terms of his personality, perhaps his most defining attribute was his overweening pride. As Eru gifted Melkor with the largest portion of knowledge and to share in all the gifts afforded to the other Valar, Melkor was very aware of his personal superiority as compared to the other Ainuar. From nearly the beginning of his existence, Melkor wished to have the power of creation, a power that only Eru Ilúvatar possessed. Yet he searched in vain not realizing that the Flame Imperishable was not some external force or object but the power of Eru himself to create. When the music Eru used to create the universe of Arda commenced, Melkor reasoning that if he couldn't make the universe he could at least shape it to his will, created discordant music in opposition to Eru as a bid to wrest control of Arda from Eru. This would foreshadow the other great aspect of Melkor's character. Whatever Melkor wanted, he would do everything in his power to try and make it his. To own it or dominate it.

When Melkor discovered that he would never be able to possess Arda, Eru admonished him by telling him that all that he could accomplish had its utmost source in Ilúvatar himself as Melkor could only shape or twist what Eru had already created and even Melkor's existence was by Eru's design. This shamed and humiliated Melkor and he began to descend into anger and bitterness. When Arda came into being, he desired lordship of it for the sake of his own self-aggrandizement rather than for the sake of ordering it according to the will of Ilúvatar. It wasn't enough to simply rule Arda, Melkor wanted absolute control to the point were anything he didn't build or craft he destroyed simply because it wasn't his. This meant that anything the Valar tried to do when shaping middle-earth, he destroyed. This led to another defining trait. He would do anything to take what he desired and when he was denied it, he began to squander his gifts in wasteful and wanton destructiveness, using his vast power to ruin the works of the other Valar. He also envied anyone who possessed anything in greater quantity than himself, and that which he could not control, he grew eventually to hate.

He began with a desire for light, but when he could not possess it for himself alone, he turned instead to darkness. His power and knowledge, both of which were greater than all the other Valar, he perverted to manipulation and deception, and he became an absolute and consummate liar. Ever denied the lordship and worship he so coveted, he squandered his power in fashioning evil servants who would give him these things, dispersing himself, his power, and his malice into the very fabric of Arda.

Initially, Melkor could take on any form he chose. The Ainur took on forms reflective of their moods and might. Melkor, in his arrogance, malice and power, took on a form recorded as:

It is said that out of all the Valar, Melkor was most like Aulë for his craftsmanship. Originally the brightest, most beautiful, most powerful Ainu, he fell through jealousy, pride and hatred of others, into Darkness with ever after a desire to conquer and to rule. When he built Utumno he took on a form shaped roughly manlike but great in size, "a Dark Lord, tall and terrible." This form was chained by the Valar. When he walked in Valinor he wore a much fairer form, so noble and lofty and benevolent not even the Elves (save only Fëanor and Galadriel) are recorded as seeing through it to the malice underneath. This he cast off to escape unclad from the hunt of the Valar, and when he faced Ungoliant he put back on the form of the tyrant of Utumno. In that form he remained ever after. As he spent his might and poured out his power into the very fabric of matter, as well as into all his creations, he grew more stooped and less majestic, and his hands were burned black from the touch of the Silmarils. His eyes shone with a daunting light.

There is some dispute over Morgoth's size. *The Silmarillion* states:

As Elves typically reached about six feet tall, or close to seven feet for the Ñoldor, Morgoth must have stood at least twice this length, and with the shadow he robed himself in he may well have seemed taller. In most artistic renderings Morgoth is depicted as towering over other beings, most notably Elves (Fingolfin in particular) of the FA.

Initially, Melkor's power was so great that he could contend with all the other Valar and Maiar of Arda and beat them (ere Tulkas came). Over time, however, his power was dispersed into the fabric of Arda and into his servants, lessening his might. At the time of his visit to Fëanor at Formenos, Melkor was still referred to as "the greatest being in Eä", though this was before his capture and final defeat by the Valar. It is unknown how much of his power he put into his various slaves after returning to Angband.

Despite his overwhelming might, he was also known to be remarkably cowardly, reluctant to personally engage in battle even when victory was completely assured. Part of this was because, alone of the Valar, he eventually became bound to a physical form which could be destroyed. He possessed virtually peerless cunning, most notably as he deceived and manipulated most of the other Valar except for Tulkas and Ulmo, both of whom were slow to forgive his past transgressions. Many of his most terrible deeds in Arda were achieved through treachery, manipulation, misdirection, and lies, and he seduced many Maiar (Sauron and Balrogs) to betray the Valar and serve him with false promises. However, as an utterly pitiless and merciless being, acts of compassion, mercy, or pity were entirely beyond his comprehension, and he seemed to have a serial tendency to underestimate the valor and capabilities of his foes.

## In other versions
In J.R.R. Tolkien's early concept of the Children of the Ainur, Melkor had a son Kosomot (later Gothmog) with an ogress, Ulbandi.

In other writings, it was said that Melkor wanted to claim the Maia Arien as his wife and ravished her, to "destroy and disdain her, not to beget any fiery offspring".

In some versions, Melkor will be defeated by Eönwë during the Dagor Dagorath, driven by his love for Arien, instead of by Túrin Turambar.

## In adaptations
### In *The Hobbit'' film trilogy
In , during the Attack on Dol Guldur, after Elrond and Saruman defeated the Nazgul, Sauron appears, reviving his servants, and predicted the fall of the West and the rise of Angmar, declaring the Elves' time is up and the Orcs' time has come. With his appearance, Galadriel arises in her spectral form with her phial, dueling Sauron in a battle of wills. One of the titles she taunted him with was "Servant of Morgoth", mocking him as bearing no name or face or form before casting him out, forcing him to retreat to Mordor.

### In *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy
In , when the Fellowship encounters goblins and Orcs in Moria after entering Balin's tomb, they eventually fight their adversaries for a long period of time, until a deep roar scatters them away, accompanied by a sprouting of fiery columns, as the Orcs and goblins flee. Eventually, as it comes nearer, Gandalf recognizes the creature as a Balrog of Morgoth from the Elder Days, a demon of the ancient world. Gandalf is immediately alarmed and tells his companions to frantically run, as this enemy's power was beyond their capacity to overcome. Legolas also describes it as such to Galadriel when speaking of the Wizard's demise.

Although not Morgoth himself, the design for Sauron (in particular, his armor) seen during flashbacks to the War of the Last Alliance was taken in part from the narrative description of Morgoth.

### In *The Rings of Power* series

In the  of the , Morgoth's shadow is briefly glimpsed in a flashback causing the death of the Two Trees, thus resulting in the Darkening of Valinor.
