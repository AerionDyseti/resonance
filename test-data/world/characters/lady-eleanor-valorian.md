**History:** Born into the prestigious Valorian family of Hyria, Lady Eleanor spent her early years learning the intricacies of noble politics and governance. She came of age during the tumultuous Human Expansion War, where countless kingdoms fought for sovereignty and territory.

She established the Winners' Circle, a prestigious salon that serves as neutral ground for negotiation among the nobility. As hostess and major tournament sponsor, she exercises quiet political influence through cultural prestige and carefully curated events.

Recently, she has taken a particular interest in the preservation of ancient Hyrian artifacts and lore, believing they hold crucial lessons for maintaining harmony in the present day.
