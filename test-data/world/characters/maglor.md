# Maglor

**Maglor** was the second son of Fëanor and Nerdanel. He was the greatest poet and minstrel of the Ñoldor and was said to have inherited more of his mother's gentler temperament.

Among the seven brothers, only Maglor, Caranthir, and Curufin were married, but nothing is known of their wives. This oath took the seven brothers to Middle-earth during the late First Age where they established realms in exile, waged war against the armies of Morgoth, fought their own Elven kind, and eventually brought ruin upon themselves.

Maglor took part in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, and he made the lament *Noldolantë*, the Fall of the Noldor, in memory of the terrible event.

Maglor and his brothers traveled toward the east of Beleriand. Maglor founded the area between the hills surrounding Himring and Blue Mountains, called '''Maglor's Gap'*. Years later, the dragon Glaurung passed Maglor's Gap and destroyed the lands about. Maglor and his people fled to Himring to join Maedhros before the Dagor Bragollach took place.

After the Dagor Bragollach, the peoples of Bór and Ulfang came into Beleriand. They and their sons swore allegiance to Maedhros and Maglor.

Maglor and his brothers learned when Dior, the new King of Doriath, possessed a Silmaril and refused to give them the jewel that had been won by Beren and worn by Lúthien. In the Sack of Doriath, Maglor's younger brothers Celegorm, Curufin and Caranthir were killed, and the Silmaril was not recovered.

Afterwards, Maglor and his surviving brothers dwelt on Amon Ereb in East Beleriand. Hearing that Elwing, the wife of Eärendil, had escaped from Doriath with the Silmaril and was now living at the Havens of Sirion, the brothers did not act at once, repenting against their destruction of Doriath. But after a time, remembering their oath, they sent messages to the Havens of Sirion that offered friendship while demanding that the Silmaril be returned to them. And when these demands were refused, they mounted an attack on the Havens with their remaining followers, thus perpetrating the Third Kinslaying that resulted from the accursed Oath of Fëanor.

Though they won the fight, after spilling much of their kin's blood, they did not obtain the Silmaril for Elwing escaped over the Great Sea with it. After the carnage of the cruel bloodletting, Maglor and his brother Maedhros came upon the two young sons of Eärendil and Elwing, Elrond and Elros. With so much blood already on his hands, Maglor took pity on them and would not allow them to be slain. So, in the absence of their parents, he took them into his household and raised them as if they were his own children.

After the War of Wrath, Maglor and his last surviving brother Maedhros stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the Valar from Morgoth, even though initially Maglor tried to dissuade his older brother from doing this. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned in Maglor and Maedhros's hands. Unable to bear the suffering, Maglor cast his Silmaril into the sea. Thereafter, as the legend claims, he wandered along the shores of the world singing laments over the loss of the Silmaril, until he faded from memory.

## Etymology
His father-name was **Kanafinwë**, which meant "Strong-voiced Finwë" or "Commanding Finwë" from *kano* ("commanding"). His mother-name was **Macalaurë**, meaning "Gold-cleaver" from Quenya words *mak* ("cleave") and *laurë* ("gold"), possibly alluding to the power of his voice. ***Maglor*** is a Sindarin rendering of his Quenya mother-name.

### Other names
Maglor's Old English name is **Daegmund Swinsere**. Christopher Tolkien cannot explain the origin of the name Daegmund, but the Old English *mund* means "hand" and "protection". The word Swinsere means "musician" or "singer".

## Other versions of the legendarium
He was counted among the greatest minstrels of the Elves, along with Daeron, Ivárë, and Tinfang. In the earliest drafts for , Maglor and the fate of the Silmarils have three different version:
- In the first draft, labeled "S" by Christopher Tolkien, it is said that Maglor alone steals the two remaining Silmarils from Fionwë's keeping. He later casts his Silmaril into a pit, knowing that he no longer has right to it, while Maedhros breaks the retrieved Silmarils and restores the light of the Two Trees of Valinor.

- In the second draft, dubbed "QI", both brothers steal the Silmarils and it is Maedhros (not Maglor) who's persuaded to submit. Maedhros is captured by Eönwë and slays himself. Maglor throws his Silmaril into a fiery pit and wanders singing in sorrow by the Sea.

- In the third and last version, "QII", Maglor and Maedhros share the same fate as is told in *The Silmarillion*, but here it is Maedhros who finds and saves Elrond.
