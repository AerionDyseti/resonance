# Gothmog (Balrog)

__NOTOC__
**Gothmog** was the primary Lord of Balrogs during the First Age, and the greatest Balrog ever to walk Middle-earth. He was High-captain of Angband, being Morgoth's front-line lieutenant as well as one of his most important servants. He fought many battles in the name of his master, and was personally responsible for killing two of the High Kings of the Ñoldor.

Gothmog, like the rest of his kind, carried a fiery whip into battle, but was also known for wielding a great black axe, feared by Elves across Beleriand.

## Biography

Gothmog was initially one of the Maiar who gave their allegiance to Melkor. Prior to the revolt of the Ñoldor, he was High Captain of Angband, given the title "Lord of Balrogs." Fëanor pressed on to Angband with just a small company, and in that hour, the Balrogs issued forth. Gothmog was among them. Fëanor came even within sight of Angband, but was ambushed with few Elves about him. Soon he stood alone, but long he fought on alone against all the Balrogs. But at the last Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, smote him to the ground, inflicting a mortal wound, and the High King of the Ñoldor fell. The Sons of Fëanor arrived and carried the body of their father away, but Fëanor had passed. Gothmog reappeared as a general of Angband in several more major conflicts, including the Dagor Aglareb and the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. During the Nírnaeth, Gothmog engaged the High King of the Ñoldor, Fingon, in battle. Gothmog separated Fingon from the main host but was unable to kill Fingon (in earlier versions) until the second and lesser Balrog lord Lungorthin appeared behind the Ñoldorin king and "cast a throng of steel about him". This allowed Gothmog to slay Fingon and beat the body to dust. Thereafter, he captured Húrin, father of Túrin Turambar, and dragged him back to Angband.

In FA 510, Gothmog and the forces of Angband besieged the Hidden City of Gondolin. They breached the northern gates and were later confronted by Ecthelion of the Fountain, whom Gothmog dueled. Knocking Ecthelion's sword out of his hands, Gothmog prepared to strike at him, but, as he raised his axe, Ecthelion ran forward at the Balrog lord, ramming his pointed helmet into the beast's chest and forcing both of them into the Fountain of the King. The waters quenched the flames of Gothmog and drowned both him and Ecthelion, ending the Battle of Gondolin.
## Etymology
***Gothmog*** is a Quenya name, of the terms *gos* or *goth* ("dread") and *-mbaw* ("compel, force, subject, oppress").

Gothmog's Quenya name was **Osombauko**.

## In other versions
Gothmog was briefly conceived as an offspring of Melkor and Ulbandi, an ogress, and went by the name of **Kosomot**. The root of the name *moko* translated to "hate".
