# Ecthelion

**Ecthelion** was an Elf-lord of Gondolin, leader of the People of the Fountain and slayer of Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs. He was also at one point the Warden of the Great Gate of Gondolin. Ecthelion had the most beautiful voice and greatest musical talent with the flute of all the people of Gondolin.

## History

In the year , Ecthelion fought alongside Turgon in the battle Nirnaeth Arnoediad, leading a wing of Gondolin's forces. Upon the defeat of the Noldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated. Surviving the disastrous battle, Ecthelion returned towards the Hidden City where he next appeared as Warden of the Great Gate.

Twenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Tuor and Voronwë traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by Elemmakil through the Seven Gates, Ecthelion appeared before them. He is portrayed as great and lordly, all clad in silver and having a bright glance. Upon his helm there was a spike with a diamond point, and he bore a shield which shimmered as "a thousand studs of crystal". At first denying passage for Tuor, he allows it after the latter shows the arms of Vinyamar and mentions Ulmo, saying that the Lord of the Fountains should not oppose the Lord of the Waters.

In the year , Morgoth attacked the city. Ecthelion battled there against Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs in the Place of the Fountain, where they slew each other. The battle was well detailed in *The Fall of Gondolin*, and long remembered by the elves.

## Etymology

With the development of the Elvish languages, the name *Ecthelion* had its own evolution. 

The early Gnomish conception meant "Lord of the Fountains", from *ecthel* ("issue of water, spring"). Its Qenya cognate was ***Ektelion***.

In the Noldorin stage of the name, it is composed from *ehtë* ("spear") and *thela* ("point" of spear). Put together they could be translated as "Spear-point" or "Spear-head".

The Sindarin version should have been ***Ægthelion***, derived from *aeg* ("sharp") + *thel* ("intent, resolve") + *-on* (masculine suffix). However, Tolkien wrote that the early *Ecthelion* sounded good and it had already been used in publication (with the name of two ruling stewards in *The Lord of the Rings*), so he let it as a late colloquial form of the archaic Sindarin name *Ægthelion*

## Other versions of the legendarium
### The Book of Lost Tales
The most detailed text about Ecthelion and his deeds during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter "The Fall of Gondolin", in *The Book of Lost Tales*. There it is told that he is the lord of the house of the Fountain, one of the twelve houses of the Gondothlim. Its people found delight in diamonds and the silver of their arrays was most beautiful to the sight. 

During the siege of the city, Ecthelion led his folk into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes, and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.

### A note from *The Nature of Middle-earth*
In a very late note dated c. 1972-3, Tolkien seemed to imply that Ecthelion and Egalmoth were of royal lineage, since some Ruling Stewards of Gondor were named after "*renowned heroes in the **royal lines of old***".
