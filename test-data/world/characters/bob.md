# Bob

**Bob** was a Bree-lander (either a Man or a Hobbit) who worked in The Prancing Pony.

## History
Bob worked alongside Nob for Barliman Butterbur, primarily as an ostler in The Prancing Pony at the end of the Third Age. Bob was the one who located the last pony left in Bree when all others has bolted following the Nazgûl's attack. Later when Merry's ponies found their way back to Bree (thanks to Tom Bombadil) it was Bob who cared for them; he put them to work but treated them well.

After the Ruffians entered Bree, Bob stopped working evenings, so that he could be home before nightfall.
