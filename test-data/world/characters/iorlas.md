# Iorlas

**Iorlas** (b. TA 2990) was a man who lived in Minas Tirith. He was the uncle of Bergil.

During Peregrin Took's first stay in Minas Tirith, Bergil mentioned that the hobbit was as old as his uncle, Iorlas. 

## In adaptations

In , Iorlas is Beregond's brother and is first found  on the seventh level of pre-battle Minas Tirith. During the siege of the city he is struck by a fallen stone, but is protected by his helmet, suffering only what he calls a "dizziness".
