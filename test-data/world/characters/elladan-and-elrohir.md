# Elladan and Elrohir

**Elladan** and **Elrohir** were the twin sons, and eldest children, of Elrond and Celebrían.

They were descended from the royal Houses of the Eldar through both their father and mother, but also from the noble Houses of the Edain through their father.

## Description
The brothers were tall, dark-haired and grey-eyed, and so much alike that only those that knew them well could tell them apart. To Meriadoc Brandybuck, their fair elven faces seemed neither old nor young. While in the Grey Company, they wore cloaks of silver-grey over bright mail. In the Redhorn Pass, she was captured by Orcs of the Misty Mountains, and tortured. The twins rode to rescue her, but by the time they reached her, she had received a poisonous wound. Though their father healed her, she would not remain in Middle-earth, and sailed into the West the following year. they saw Arathorn II killed by orcs while hunting with him.

### War of the Ring

In the early part of the War of the Ring, the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the Fellowship. Around November of , they were sent by Elrond on a secret errand. They passed down the Silverlode into a "strange country" and were the last to return to Rivendell in December.

Later, they took a more active part. When Halbarad rode to Aragorn's aid with the Grey Company, Elladan and Elrohir accompanied them and Elrohir gave counsel from his father to Aragorn to "remember the Paths of the Dead". They followed Aragorn through the Paths of the Dead, fought with him at Pelargir, and took part in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where they fought with stars bound to their brows. Both were present at a council of Aragorn and his captains, and then accompanied the force that fought in the Battle of the Morannon.

After the celebrations and the coronation of Aragorn, the brothers departed Minas Tirith on 8 May. On 14 June they met with the escort of their sister on her way to Gondor to marry Aragorn, and together they went to Edoras. They stayed there for two days before setting out for Gondor. They arrived to the City on 1 Lithe and the brothers held a silver banner.

### Later fate
After the War, little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at Rivendell and remained there even after their father had passed across the Sea. Like their sister Arwen, the sons of Elrond Half-elven were granted the choice of whether to leave Middle-earth for the Undying Lands, or remain there and become mortal as Men. They chose, for a time at least, to stay in Middle-earth for reasons unknown. However, due to the fact that shortly before Aragorn died in , he said to Arwen that 'none now walk' in the garden of Elrond, indicating that the last of the Eldar had departed to Valinor, and that Celeborn dwelt in Rivendell for a while before he eventually departed over the Sea,

### Elrohir
- Elrohir* is Sindarin for "Elf-man" or "Elf-knight", from *el* ("elf") + *rohir* ("horse-lord").
