# Erkenbrand

**Erkenbrand** was one of the Rohirrim. He was the Lord of Deeping-coomb and of much other land in the Westfold during the War of the Ring.

## History
Erkenbrand had been an officer in the King's Riders in his youth. At the time of the War of the Ring Erkenbrand was Lord of Deeping-coomb and much other land in the Westfold. As such, he was the chief lord in the West-mark. He was the uncle of Dúnhere. He gave the command in the field to Grimbold until he could come himself to the battlefield. Erkenbrand did not immediately go to the battlefield due to the fact that he was occupied for three days gathering all those able to bear arms and stores of food to defend the Hornburg.

On 2 March, , the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen was fought, and the defences on the Isen were driven back by Saruman's forces. The survivors, led by Grimbold and Elfhelm, were retreating from the fords of the river Isen when they came across Gandalf. Gandalf told them Théoden sought the refuge of the Hornburg, and that they should join Erkenbrand to attack the besiegers. They arrived with a thousand men at dawn of March 4,  and turned the tide of the Battle of the Hornburg. 

Erkenbrand did not come to Minas Tirith to fight in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. King Théoden gave him the command of the forces that were left behind to defend Rohan because of Erkenbrand's dignity and authority.

After the funeral of King Théoden, which took place on 10 August,  , King Éomer appointed Erkenbrand to the post of Marshal of the West-mark.

## Appearance
Erkenbrand was said to have been tall and strong with a red shield and a great black horn. King Théoden said that the valour of Helm Hammerhand lived again in Erkenbrand.
