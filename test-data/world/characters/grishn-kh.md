# Grishnákh

**Grishnákh** was a captain of Orcs from Mordor. He was described as being a short, crook-legged creature, broad, with long arms hanging almost to the ground.

## History
On 26 February  Grishnákh was part of a raiding party that captured Merry and Pippin at Parth Galen. He was the captain of a group of Mordor-orcs which had joined Uglúk's forces on the plains of Rohan during the War of the Ring. When Pippin awoke and heard the Orcs arguing he noted that Grishnákh's voice sounded softer but more evil than the others. Grishnákh threatened to report the doings of the mountain-orcs and of Uglúk to Lugbúrz (Barad-dûr).

## Portrayal in adaptations
