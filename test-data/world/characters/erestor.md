# Erestor

**Erestor** was an Elf of Rivendell, and the chief counsellor of Elrond.

## History
Erestor, being the chief counsellor of Elrond's household at the time of the War of the Ring, took part in the Council of Elrond. He did not support the idea of destroying the Ring, and preferred instead the notion of guarding it from Sauron, perhaps with the aid of Iarwain ben-adar. His suggestion was countered by Glorfindel, as well as Galdor, as they did not believe that Iarwain had the power to defy Sauron's. 

Erestor accompanied Arwen to her marriage with Aragorn in Gondor in .

## Etymology
The name *Erestor* is in Sindarin, but its meaning is unclear.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest introduction of Erestor, he was one of three counsellors of Elrond's (the other two being unnamed); all three were kinsmen of Elrond's, "of that half-elvish folk whom the Elves named the children of Lúthien". In a further update, the other two were made into unnamed Elf-lords of Rivendell, with Erestor being the sole remaining half-elf and kinsman of Elrond. However, Erestor is never called a half-elf in the finished text. 

In the initial selection for the Nine of the Company of the Ring, Erestor was to represent the half-Elves.

Originally, only Elrond, Galadriel, and Celeborn accompany Arwen to her wedding.
