# Duilin (son of Duinhir)

**Duilin** was one of the two sons of Duinhir, the lord of Blackroot Vale.

## History
With his brother Derufin, Duilin followed his father to Minas Tirith in the War of the Ring, and there they fought in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. The Men of the distant valley of Morthond had great skill as bowmen, and so Duilin and Derufin led their archers against the mûmakil, attempting to shoot out the beasts' eyes. Brave as they were, both the brothers were lost in that battle, trampled by their gigantic foes.

## Etymology
The meaning of *Duilin* is unclear. Both in Gnomish and in the later Noldorin the name meant "swallow", but in Sindarin it could be "Singer by the River" or "Spring-Singer", containing the same element *duin* "river" as in the name of his father.
