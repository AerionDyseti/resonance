# Aragorn II

**Aragorn II**, son of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also known as **Strider** and **Elessar**, was the 16th and last Chieftain of the Dúnedain of the North; later crowned **King Elessar Telcontar** (March 1, 2931 - FO 120), the 26th King of Arnor, 35th King of Gondor and first High King of Gondor and Arnor since the short reign of Isildur. He was a great ranger and warrior, and bore, as Isildur's heir, the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed Andúril ("Flame of the West") in the War of the Ring.

## Biography
### Early years

Aragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur through the line of the Lords of Andúnië to Elendil, High King of Arnor and Gondor. Like all of the kings before him, he was Elrond's kin through the House of Elros.  His ancestor Arvedui was wedded to Fíriel, descended from Anárion, who bore their son Aranarth, making Aragorn the last descendant of both Isildur and Anárion.

When he was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing Orcs. Aragorn was afterwards fostered in Rivendell by Elrond. At the request of his mother, his lineage was kept secret, as she feared he would be killed like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed "Estel" and was not told about his heritage until 2951.

Elrond revealed to "Estel" his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, giving him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil, but withholding the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he "came of the right" to possess the item. It was also around this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond's daughter, newly returned from her mother's homeland of Lothlórien where she had been visiting her grandmother Galadriel.

Later in 2980, he visited Lothlórien, and there once again met Arwen. He gave her the heirloom of his House, the Ring of Barahir, and, on the hill of Cerin Amroth, Arwen pledged her hand to him in marriage, renouncing her Elvish lineage and accepting the Gift of Ilúvatar: Death. Gollum, however, escaped some time later with the aid of Sauron's Orcs.

### War of the Ring

#### Escorting the hobbits
Aragorn returned with Gandalf in the spring of TA 3018, and then went away on his own journey, and was not able to help when Gandalf discovered the Nazgûl were seeking for Frodo and the Ring in the Shire. After Frodo left Hobbiton, Gildor Inglorion informed Aragorn that the Nine were looking for him and Gandalf was missing. Aragorn continued to watch the Great East Road until Tom Bombadil and the four hobbits came from the Barrow-downs. Following them to Bree, he met Frodo at the Inn of the Prancing Pony under the name "Strider," as the Men of Bree called him. Though originally the hobbits were suspicious of him, Barliman Butterbur brought a letter from Gandalf that made them trust him. Aragorn was aged 87 at that time, nearing the prime of life for one of royal Númenórean descent.

After the raid on Bree, Aragorn led the Hobbits out of Bree-land and through the Midgewater Marshes. While there, he saw Gandalf's battle with the Nazgûl on Weathertop from a distance. When they themselves came to Weathertop, they discovered five of the Nazgûl had followed them, and during the later attack he fought off the Ringwraiths. After attempting to heal Frodo with athelas, he led them across the Lone-lands towards the Trollshaws. They met with the Elf-lord Glorfindel who led them to the Ford of Bruinen. When the Nazgûl caught up with them and Elrond released a flood, Aragorn and the Hobbits kindled fire and flushed out those Nazgûl that had remained on the western bank. He then accompanied Frodo to Rivendell.

During the feast of victory, Aragorn was gathering news from Elladan and Elrohir, and later helped his friend Bilbo compose his Lay of Eärendil. During the Council of Elrond, he revealed himself to Boromir as the heir of Isildur and described his capture of Gollum. After Elrond decided that the Ring must be destroyed in Mordor, Frodo took the burden upon himself. There, Aragorn chose to join Frodo, thus forming the Fellowship of the Ring, tasked with accompanying Frodo in destroying the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom. Besides Aragorn, Gandalf, and Frodo, the company included Frodo's cousins Pippin and Merry, his best friend Samwise Gamgee, Legolas the Elf, Gimli the Dwarf, and Boromir of Gondor. Aragorn then led the company to Lothlórien, where he visited Cerin Amroth for the last time. At their parting, Lady Galadriel gave him the Elfstone.

After Lórien, Aragorn and the Fellowship sailed down the River Anduin to the Falls of Rauros. Aragorn attempted to catch Gollum several times. Though his original plan was to set out for Gondor and aid its people in the war, he felt responsible for Frodo after the loss of Gandalf and was conflicted about what path to take.

While Frodo continued his quest with Samwise Gamgee, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli went to Rohan to free Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by the Uruk-hai in Saruman's service.

#### The Three Hunters
Aragorn ran from Parth Galen across the width of Rohan in just four days. As they approached Fangorn Forest, the "Three Hunters" Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli encountered Éomer, who had recently pursued and routed an Orc-band in the area. From Éomer, Aragorn learned that the Orcs who had kidnapped Merry and Pippin had been destroyed and that the Hobbits had not been found. Dejected, he led Legolas and Gimli to the site of the battle. Clues led Aragorn to believe that the Hobbits might still be alive, and he led the Three Hunters into Fangorn Forest. They did not find the Hobbits, but they did find Gandalf the White, sent back to continue his struggle against Sauron. Gandalf told the Three Hunters that the Hobbits were safe with the Ents of Fangorn.

#### The Battle of Hornburg
Together, Gandalf and the Three Hunters travelled to Edoras, where Gandalf freed Théoden from Saruman's enchantment and helped him organize the Rohirrim against Saruman. He allied with Théoden and joined the king's Éored, journeying to Helm's Deep.

Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli then helped the people of Rohan in the Battle of the Hornburg, in which they conclusively defeated Saruman's army. Afterward Aragorn went with Gandalf to Isengard, only to find it in ruins by the work of the Ents. Aragorn, being present with Gandalf, Théoden, Éomer, Legolas and Gimli, negotiated in a final parley with Saruman. Saruman attempted to bend Théoden to his will, and at first the king was almost swayed, but mastering his will he refused to join with Saruman. Saruman also attempted to sway Gandalf, but failed in this also, and even so Gandalf offered his counterpart the opportunity for forgiveness. Saruman refused to repent out of pride and to avoid seeming a rebel to Sauron, and thus Gandalf broke Saruman's staff and banished him from the Order of Wizards and the White Council. After Saruman crawled away, Gríma Wormtongue threw the palantír of Orthanc at Gandalf as he and the others were leaving. He missed, however, unable to decide if he hated Saruman or Gandalf more, and thus ended the Battle of the Hornburg and the destruction of Isengard. After Pippin revealed himself to Sauron in the stone, Gandalf gave the palantír to Aragorn.

Not long after the Grey Company of Rangers arrived from the north, dispatched by Galadriel. With them rode Elladan and Elrohir and Halbarad, bearing a standard made for him by Arwen. When Aragorn returned to Helms Deep, he decided to draw Sauron out and used the palantír to show himself and Andúril to the Dark Lord, wrenching the Stone to his will after a long struggle with the Dark Lord. However, this led Sauron to swiftly send out the forces he had long prepared to attack Minas Tirith.

#### Return of the King

In order to defend the city, Aragorn travelled the Paths of the Dead, and summoned the Dead Men of Dunharrow who owed allegiance to the Heir of Isildur. It had been prophesied by Isildur and Malbeth the Seer that the Dead would be summoned once more to pay their debt for betraying Gondor an age before. With their aid the Corsairs of Umbar were defeated at the Battle of Pelargir.

Aragorn, a small force of Rangers, and a large contingent of men and soldiers from the southern regions then sailed up the Anduin to Minas Tirith. When they arrived at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Aragorn unfurled a standard that Arwen had made for him which showed both the White Tree of Gondor along with the jeweled crown and seven stars of the House of Elendil. With the help of the southern forces the armies of Gondor and Rohan rallied together and defeated Sauron's army.

The Steward Denethor II declared that he would not bow to a descendant of Isildur (years before, he had seen "Thorongil" as a rival to his father's favor and soon discovered his true identity) and burned himself to death during the battle, despairing of final victory. Aragorn healed Faramir, Denethor's last heir, Éowyn and Merry, who together slew the Witch-king as well as many others. This won him the immediate recognition of Faramir as rightful heir to the throne; his humility and self-sacrifice gained him the hearts of the inhabitants of Gondor's capital city. Aragorn's healing abilities, moreover, were a sign to the people of Gondor of the identity of their true king; as Ioreth said, *"The hands of the King are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known."* The people hailed him as King that same evening.

Despite his immediate success and popularity, however, and despite his claim to the throne through raising the royal banner, Aragorn decided to lay aside his claim for the time being. He knew that if he aggressively promoted his claim, rival claimants or debates as to his legitimacy were not out of the question, and this could be a fatal distraction for Gondor at a time when the West needed to be united against Sauron. So, to avoid conflict, after he had healed people during the following nights of March 15–16, he left Minas Tirith and symbolically refused to enter it again until he was crowned King on May 1.

#### Captain of the West
Aragorn then led the Host of the West to Mordor as per the advice of Gandalf and Elrond, to divert Sauron's attention from Frodo and Sam. They marched over the Anduin river and came to Minas Morgul, and set fire to the fields there. Leaving a guard at the Cross-roads of the Fallen King, they began to march north along the North Road of Ithilien, and Aragorn won a skirmish against some Orcs and Easterlings that tried to ambush them. They then reached the desert before Mordor, and Aragorn allowed those who were afraid to depart to retake Cair Andros. The Army of the West then reached the Black Gate, and Aragorn along with Gandalf, Éomer, Imrahil, Pippin, Legolas and Gimli rode up to it and called for Sauron to come forth. He then watched as the Mouth of Sauron revealed Sauron knew about Frodo and Sam, and saw Gandalf's rejection of Sauron's terms. The Host of the West was then encircled by Sauron's forces, a vast army of Orcs and Men. Aragorn then arranged the Army of the West defensively on two Slag-hills and the Battle of the Morannon began.

After the destruction of the Ring and the defeat of Sauron, Aragorn freed the slaves of Núrn and gifted them the entire land in southern Mordor.

### As King of Reunited Gondor and Arnor

Upon Sauron's defeat, Aragorn was crowned as **King Elessar**, a name given to him by Galadriel and adopted by the people of Gondor because of the Elfstone he wore. He became the **twenty-sixth King of Arnor**, **thirty-fifth King of Gondor**, and the first **High King of the Reunited Kingdom**, though it would be several years before his authority was firmly re-established in Arnor. His line was referred to as the House of Telcontar (Telcontar being Quenya for "Strider"). Aragorn married Arwen shortly afterwards, and ruled the Kingdom of Gondor and Arnor until 120 of the Fourth Age. His reign was marked by great harmony and prosperity within Gondor and Arnor, and by a great renewal of cooperation and communication among Men, Elves, and Dwarves, fostered by his vigorous rebuilding campaign following the war. Aragorn led the forces of the Reunited Kingdom on military campaigns against some Easterlings and Haradrim, re-establishing rule over all the territory that Gondor had lost in previous centuries.

During his coronation, Aragorn spoke Elendil's Oath: ''"Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!"'' ("Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. In this place, I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.")

### End of Reign and Death

When in the year 120 of the Fourth Age, King Elessar realised his days were at an end, he went to the House of the Kings in the Silent Street. He said farewell to his son Eldarion and his daughters and gave Eldarion his crown and sceptre. Arwen remained at Aragorn's side until he died. A year after Aragorn's death, Arwen died in Lothlórien of a broken heart. Eldarion began his reign as the second King of the Reunited Kingdom after his father's death.
***Longshanks** - Used by Samwise Gamgee and some of the Men of Bree

### Titles
As king, Aragorn had many titles:
***The Dúnadan**
***Chieftain of the Dúnedain** or **Lord of the Dúnedain of Arnor**
***Heir of Isildur**
***Heir of Elendil**
***King of all the Dúnedain**
***King of the West**
***Envinyatar** - "the Renewer"

Quite soon Tolkien finally settled on the Mannish identity of Trotter, from the beginning introducing him as a "descendant of the ancient men of the North, and one of Elrond's household", as well as the name Aragorn. While the history of Númenor and the descendants of Elros and Elendil were not fully developed, the terms of it were in existence, and would come to be connected with *The Lord of the Rings* as the character of Aragorn developed. Thus the evolution of the history of the Second and Third Ages was dependent on the bringing of Trotter to association with them.

#### Further development
The development of Aragorn's connection to Gondor was long and complex, as was his association with Boromir. Initially it is said that Aragorn's forefathers were the exiles of Númenor who ruled over the people of Ond (the early name of Gondor), but were driven out by the Wizard King "when Sauron raised a rebellion". The story of the two branches of Elendil's descendants ruling over two kingdoms of Men through many generations only emerged gradually; at one time, Tolkien even seems to have conceived only three generations between Isildur and Aragorn.

One significant feature which was not established until late stages was Aragorn's relationship with Arwen. When Tolkien first introduced Éowyn, the interest which she showed towards Aragorn was not one-sided, with suggestions in notes that they would marry at the end of the story. Another proposal was done soon, that Éowyn would die to save or avenge Théoden, and Aragorn would never marry after her death.

The first mention of Elrond's daughter, named Arwen Undómiel, was in reference to the banner which she made for Aragorn, but Tolkien did not give any hint whether she had any further part to play. The references to her marriage with Aragorn were made later, but it was explicitly stated only near the completion of the book. It is only in his working on the appendices for *The Lord of the Rings* that Tolkien recorded the published version of *The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen*.

A passing idea was that Galadriel gave her Ring to Aragorn, and that he would accordingly be titled the "Lord of the Ring".

#### Rejected names
The original nickname **Trotter** was retained for a long while, and Tolkien decided to change it to Strider only after the story was completed. There were also several experimental translations of Trotter to Sindarin: Padathir, Du-finnion and Rimbedir, with Ecthelion possibly being equivalent to Peregrin (Boffin). Instead of the latter title "the Dúnadan", Quenya Tarkil ("Noble Man") was first used, synonym with Númenórean.

Tolkien hesitated for some time about Trotter's "real" name. Although Aragorn was the first suggestion when the Mannish descent was settled, it was changed a number of times. At one point Tolkien decided that an Elvish name does not suit a Man, and thus altered it from Aragorn via Elfstone to Ingold, where the last one is an Old English name with ing- representing "west". Later, however, a new plot element was introduced: Galadriel's gift of a green stone, and Tolkien reverted the usage to Elfstone in order to make an additional connection. This was retained into the final version of the legendarium as a side name and a translation of Elessar.

Among other names to be used instead of Elfstone Tolkien considered Elfstan, Elfmere, Elf-friend, Elfspear, Elfwold and Erkenbrand, with various Elvish forms: Eldamir, Eldavel, Eledon, and Qendemir. The name of Aragorn's father also passed through many transient forms: Tolkien intended Aramir or Celegorn to go in pair with Aragorn before settling upon Arathorn; Elfhelm and Eldakar with Elfstone and Eldamir; and Ingrim with Ingold.

## History and mythology
Richard J. Finn presented a paper entitled "Arthur and Aragorn - Arthurian Influence in LOTR at the Forty-First International Congress on Medieval Studies". The are additional similarities between Aragorn and Arthur beyond those pointed out by Finn. Arthur is descended from Kings of Goddodin - Coel Hen, Aragorn becomes King of Gondor. Kings of the period in Goddodin lived at both Traprain Law and Din Eidyn (Edinburgh, still known as *Dùn Éideann* in Scottish Gaelic) remarkably similar to Dúnadan. For "Men of the North", Goddodin was a far northern kingdom. Arthur was crowned by St. Dubriticus, who wore a long grey robe for which he was called "His Grey Eminence" - Gandalf the White also wore a grey robe at Aragorn's coronation to indicate he at one time was Gandalf the Grey.

## In adaptations
### *The Lord of the Rings* film trilogy

In  (2001 – 2003) directed by Peter Jackson, Aragorn is played by Danish-American actor Viggo Mortensen, who took over the role from Stuart Townsend after a month of rehearsals. In these movies, Aragorn must overcome his self-doubt to claim the kingship. This specific element of self-doubt is not present in Tolkien's books, where Aragorn intends to claim the throne all along. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the role, but declined. Russell Crowe was also offered the role, but likewise declined.

In , Aragorn takes on a greater role as the main protagonist. The movie sees him accept his title as king by inspiring, assisting and commanding his subjects, alongside Legolas and Gimli. Aragorn aids Théoden and Rohan in the campaign against Saruman and Isengard. He risks his life to inspire and save the world he had rejected; commanding Men and Elves in the Battle of Helm's Deep to battle Saruman's army of Uruk-hai. At the end of the film, Aragorn encourages Théoden King to ride out and meet the enemy head on. With Gandalf's intervention, the Uruk-hai are overwhelmed and slayed. He is last seen watching over Isengard. 

In the film, Théoden's niece, Éowyn, develops romantic feelings for him, but he takes her lightly, as he loves Arwen. After the battle, Éowyn is overjoyed to see that Aragorn has survived, and embraces him. 

In order to ensure safe passage across Mordor for Frodo to fulfill his quest, Aragorn then led the Army of the West out from Minas Tirith to make a diversionary feint on the Black Gate of Mordor itself in the Battle of the Morannon. Gandalf had been given supreme command of the war effort after the Pelennor Fields, and acted as chief spokesman in the parley with the Mouth of Sauron; but Aragorn commanded the Allied troops during the battle and its aftermath.

#### Non-canonical weapons
In the film adaptation, Aragorn never carries the shards of Narsil as he did in the books, and only receives the reforged Andúril before entering the Paths of the Dead. Up until this time, Aragorn uses a different, more basic sword that is never given a name. Attached to the scabbard of this sword is a small utility knife that Aragorn uses in the wild country. 

Aragorn also uses a long, curved dagger in battle, though a lot less frequently than his sword. This dagger is used for close combat and as a last resort if the sword is useless in a particular situation, such as when Aragorn is knocked down or assassinating Sauron's servants. He received a curved dagger from Celeborn in the movie, upon leaving Lothlórien. In  video game, Aragorn uses his dagger as a finishing blow for his Final Judgment and Warrior Bane combos. 

Near the end of the first movie *The Fellowship of the Ring*, in the scene where Aragorn fights the Uruk-hai Captain Lurtz, Aragorn uses his sword to deflect his Elvish dagger, which Lurtz threw at him after he stabbed him in the leg with it. This was not meant to happen as in the original script the knife was supposed to miss and hit the tree behind Aragorn, though the mask Lurtz's actor was wearing restricted his vision, causing him to miss his mark and throw the knife directly at Aragorn. Luckily he was able to use his sword to deflect the knife just in time. Peter Jackson decided to keep that scene rather than the one originally planned. 

-  Bow and arrows

Aragorn's next weapon in his arsenal is his bow. This bow is rarely used at all. Aragorn only uses it in Moria, shooting Goblins in the beginning of the Battle of the Bridge of Khazad-dûm and while fleeing the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. During these few scenes, Aragorn shows that, though he does not have the expert bow skill and speed that Legolas possesses, he is still an effective shooter when he successfully brings down two goblins through small cracks in the door.

In  and *The Return of the King* video games, Aragorn's missile weapon is his bow and arrows. In each case, Aragorn has 30 arrows.

-  The Black Stone
Aragorn's final weapon is the Black Stone. He uses it once in *The Return of the King* to summon the Oathbreakers and defeat the Corsairs of Umbar. He is not shown using it in the movie adaptation.

In , Aragorn's special, heavy attack is to summon the Army of the Dead.

In , Aragorn's most powerful ability is to summon the Army of the Dead, which appears as four abnormally large, invincible ghost units, who can kill infantry almost instantly, though they are weak against buildings. The only units capable of doing any sort of damage to the Dead are heroes, which even then get immediately wiped out.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy
While not appearing physically in Peter Jackson's , he is alluded to by Thranduil to Legolas in . In a departure from the books, he is stated to already be a Ranger and well known among his people, rather than a ten year old child. Thranduil only told him that the Ranger's name was Strider and that he was the son of Arathorn, telling him that he would have to find out Strider's true name for himself.

Given that Aragorn was 87 in *The Two Towers*, he would have been 27 during *The Hobbit* film series, since the original trilogy omitted the 17 year gap between where Gandalf leaves Frodo and finds out about the Ring's origin.

### Ralph Bakshi version of *The Lord of the Rings*
Aragorn was voiced by John Hurt in Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film version of . Bakshi's Aragorn, unlike all other portrayals that were to follow to date, has no beard. This actually conforms to a statement appearing in  that implicitly says that Aragorn was not supposed to have one, due to his Elvish ancestry (Elves did not grow beards). In a note written in 1972 or later, among the last writings of my father's on the subject of Middle-earth, there is a discussion of the Elvish strain in Men, as to its being observable in the beardlessness of those who were so descended (it was a characteristic of all Elves to be beardless. However, Tolkien actually wrote elsewhere that Elves *did* have beards; in *The Lord of the Rings* itself Círdan is described as having a beard. Also, some viewers and critics have said that this version of Aragorn looks Native American though not necessarily to the detriment of the film.

### In Rankin/Bass' *Return of the King*

Aragorn was voiced by Theodore Bikel in the 1980 Rankin/Bass animated version of , made for television. He first appears at the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, leading the reinforcements from southern Gondor.

### On stage
:Also see the Wikipedia stage article: *The Lord of the Rings* (musical)

Aragorn was portrayed by Evan Buliung in the three-hour production of , which opened in 2006 in Toronto, Canada. A scaled down revival, , also featured Aragorn.

In the United States, Aragorn was portrayed by Josh Beshears in the Cincinnati, Ohio production of *The Return of the King* (2003) for Clear Stage Cincinnati. At Chicago's Lifeline Theatre, Aragorn was played by Robert McLean in the 1999 production of *The Two Towers*.
