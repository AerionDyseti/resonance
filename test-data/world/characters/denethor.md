# Denethor

**Denethor II** was the twenty-sixth and last Ruling Steward of Gondor. He succeeded his father Ecthelion II at his death in . Denethor was described as appearing noble and powerful, even to rival the lordliness of Gandalf. He was proud, tall, wise, far-sighted, and valiant; "more kingly" than any of his predecessors for a long time. He proved a masterful lord and a great ruler, seeing to all things large and small under his command. During the War of the Ring,  however, his good judgement became tainted by "pride and despair," resulting from recent military losses at Osgiliath, the use of a palantir, the death of his son Boromir, and the threat to his Stewardship represented by Aragorn's impending arrival in Gondor.  During the siege of Minas Tirith, Denethor set himself ablaze after wrongly believing Faramir, his only other living child (whom he also attempted to burn), was killed in the battle.  

## History
### Early life
Denethor was born the third child and first son of Ecthelion II, Ruling Steward of Gondor, in .

### Early stewardship
Eight years after Denethor's marriage, Ecthelion died and he became Ruling Steward. Denethor was not viewed very highly in the eyes of his people in comparison to Thorongil, but Denethor proved a masterful ruler. He listened to counsel, said little, and followed his mind, holding everything in his own hand.

Only four years after the death of Ecthelion, Finduilas died as well. Denethor was grief-stricken, and became more grim and silent. Moreover he anticipated Sauron's assault during his time and desperately needed knowledge. Being proud and overconfident in his willpower, Denethor looked into the long-forbidden Anor-stone to seek knowledge. But he became blind to all struggles save that of him and Sauron, his people and Sauron's Orcs. He mistrusted all his allies who were not under his own rule, and though he cared for his nation, his concerns were largely political; he feared and opposed any potential rivals in the nobility, regardless of their intent, and despised lesser men. He wore mail under his robes, to prevent himself from getting soft in his old age.

### Stirring of trouble
Faramir, his younger son, began to have dreams, speaking of Imladris and Isildur's Bane. Boromir convinced his father to send him instead of his brother. Boromir did not return from his quest; he was shot by Uruk-hai on Amon Hen. Faramir and Denethor both heard the horn of Gondor. Several days later his horn was found by watchers below the Entwash, cloven in two. It was then brought to Denethor. Desperate after the death of his heir, he looked into the *palantír* more often than usual and so it grew his despair.

Thirteen days after Boromir's death, Mithrandir arrived with the hobbit Peregrin Took. Denethor openly vented his rage at first, but at the same time was curiously attracted to the hobbit, a witness of his son's death, questioning him closely and suspiciously. When Peregrin offered his service in return for Boromir's sacrifice, Denethor was pleased and amused. After examining Pippin's barrow-blade, he accepted the hobbit's service courteously. He then confronted Gandalf. While they supped, Gandalf told of the fall of Isengard. Denethor hinted at his own abilities to see what happened in the world. He racked the hobbit with questions for an hour, and then gave his guests lodging. The decision was not taken by Denethor himself, but by the Council, led by Denethor but to which Faramir took part, agreeing in the end with his father's will.

Faramir recovered the lost ground all the way back to the Anduin, but soon faced fresh troops from Minas Morgul and Harad, led by the Witch-king, a master strategist and one of terrible presence. Faramir was driven back to the Causeway Forts, but these fell, and Faramir was forced to retreat, having lost a third of his men. The retreat was dogged by the Nazgûl, and Faramir was almost killed by a wound from a southern arrow, thought to be a poisoned dart.

### Afterwards
Faramir did survive, and the city did not fall due to the timely appearance of the Rohirrim and the Dúnedain with Aragorn II. Faramir kept the title of Steward, but not of Ruling Steward, for he recognised Aragorn's right to take the throne. Using Athelas to save the lives of Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry, Aragorn was first acknowledged as King by the people of Minas Tirith before he could actually claim the title. Faramir's reaction to his father's death is not recorded, but it is said that the news of his death wasn't given to him during the first days of his recovery, in order not to grieve him.

## Etymology

For the meaning of his name refer to Denethor - Etymology. It is possible that Denethor II was named after the Nando chieftain of the Laiquendi of the First Age.

**1980: *The Return of the King* (1980 film):*'
:William Conrad is the voice of Denethor. His role is essentially reduced to presaging the doom of the arrival of the Black Ships (as he has seen in the *palantír*) to Gandalf and Pippin, and then calling for his own execution.

:Denethor is played by Heinz Schimmelpfenig.

**2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers*:*'
:Denethor, played by John Noble, appears in a flashback in the film's Extended Edition. He appears at Osgiliath shortly after Boromir completes his successful defence of the city against Sauron's forces and tells Boromir of the One Ring being found, urging his son to go attend the Council of Elrond in Rivendell and try to persuade them to bring it back to Gondor so as to use it in defence of their homeland against Sauron. Denethor also makes known his preference of Boromir over Faramir, which would further play out in the next film.

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*:*'
:Denethor appears almost entirely devoid of hope and highly irrational after learning of Boromir's death. He demands his remaining son go on essentially a suicide mission to reclaim enemy-captured Osgiliath and stubbornly refuses to light the warning beacons of Gondor to call for the aid of Rohan (Pippin lights it instead at Gandalf's behest). Denethor then claims Théoden betrayed him when Sauron's armies begin attacking Minas Tirith). In the book, the danger of his madness is that it seems to follow a certain logic; Sauron *does* have vastly superior forces, all of which he has surely shown to the Steward in the *palantír*. His actions, however, do not immediately proclaim his insanity; the Osgiliath mission is less obviously suicidal, as the city has not yet been overrun, and the warning beacons have indeed been lit, although Denethor expects little help.

:When Faramir is brought back from Osgiliath on his horse into the throne room, seemingly dead, Pippin attempts to stop Denethor from cremating his son (and himself with him), who he is sure is still alive. After Denethor throws Pippin out, the Hobbit rushes back to the battle to find Gandalf and stop the wanton murder of Faramir. When Gandalf and Pippin return astride Shadowfax, Denethor snatches a torch and (after a cynical monologue about Sauron's power in the extended edition) lights the pyre himself. Gandalf rides in, throwing Denethor off the pyre. Pippin jumps in to pull Faramir off and douses the flames on his body. A maddened Denethor attacks Pippin, but just then, Shadowfax kicks him back onto the pyre. And it's from there that he sees Faramir showing signs of life. Consumed by madness and flames, Denethor screams and flees to the precipice of the citadel, throwing himself off it and plummeting to his death.

'*2003: *Pán prsteňov* (2001-2003 Slovak radio series):**
:The voice of Denethor is provided by Marián Slovák.

**2015: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Denethor's role in the game is relatively minor, as, by the time the player reaches Minas Tirith, Faramir already lies wounded and the Steward's will is failing. One notable change is his betrothal of Boromir to Lothíriel of Dol Amroth.
