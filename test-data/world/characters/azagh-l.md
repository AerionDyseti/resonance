# Azaghâl

__NOTOC__

**Azaghâl** was king of the Broadbeam Dwarves, one of the seven Dwarf clans, and Lord of the Dwarven realm of Belegost in the Blue Mountains in the First Age.

## Biography
The Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin was originally made for him by Telchar, the great smith of Nogrod. Azaghâl had given the helm to Maedhros after he saved his life when Azaghâl was waylaid by Orcs upon the Dwarf-Road in East Beleriand.

He was slain by the dragon Glaurung after severely wounding him during the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. After his death, his kin bore him away from the battlefield ignoring the rest of their enemies and singing a frightening dirge that allowed them to leave without further incident.

As Belegost was the founding stronghold of the Broadbeams it is possible Azaghâl was the Father of the Broadbeams in the same manner that Durin was King of Khazad-dûm and Father of the Longbeards.
