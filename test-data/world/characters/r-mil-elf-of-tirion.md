# Rúmil (Elf of Tirion)

**Rúmil** was a knowledgeable loremaster of the Ñoldor living in the city of Tirion, in Valinor.

## Biography

Rúmil was possibly born in Valinor, or was perhaps one of the firstborn Elves. He thrived in Valinor, being the first to invent the art of writing down words with pen or brush on many different mediums: he invented the alphabet called Sarati (each letter being a *Sarat*). This alphabet was later expanded and perfected by Fëanor as the Tengwar. Rúmil was also a skilled linguist, and when the Teleri finally arrived in Valinor he was first to discover just how the Telerin language had changed from Common Eldarin compared to Quenya. He became part of an Elvish culture of loremasters known as the Lambeñgolmor.

When the Ñoldor determined to return to Middle-earth in pursuit of Morgoth, Rúmil was among those who refused the summons of Fëanor, remaining in Tirion as one of the Ñoldor of Finarfin.

## Etymology

***Rúmil*** is a Quenya word. Its origin is not clear - it is possibly derived from *rum*, meaning 'a secret'.

## In other versions

In  series, Rúmil is additionally given as the original author of much of the work which is included in *The Silmarillion*: the *Ainulindalë*, *Valaquenta* and ''Annals of Aman* are by his hand. He is also given as the author of the *Lhammas* and *Lhammasethen*, as well as the *Ambarkanta''. He knew many languages, that he had 'picked up'  while working in Melko's mines, to lighten the time. When Eriol first met him, he was in a poor mood; for he did not understand what one of the birds was saying.

He once narrated the story of the Music of the Ainur (when that account had not yet developed into the final version, named *Ainulindalë*) to Eriol in Tol Eressëa - the first time any Man had been told the tale - during the week of Eriol's arrival and stay at the Cottage of Lost Play.

- The War of the Jewels* attributes to him a collection of sayings called *i Equessi Rúmilo*.

Pengolodh of Gondolin later continued and completed much of his work.

## In adaptations
In *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*, Rúmil is said to be a drunkard.
