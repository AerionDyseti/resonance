# Thorin II

**Thorin II** "**Oakenshield**", eventually called **King under the Mountain** or **Mountain King**, was the son of Thráin II, the older brother of Frerin and Dís, the grandson of King Thrór and the uncle of Fíli and Kíli. Thorin was best known for his deeds as leader of a company that infiltrated the lost Kingdom under the Mountain to take it back from Smaug and for leading an alliance of Men, Dwarves, and Elves in the Battle of Five Armies.

## Biography
### Early life

Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to the Dwarf prince Thráin II in Erebor. Early in his youth, Thorin and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug, in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew into a capable warrior. This was demonstrated at the Battle of Azanulbizar, near Moria, in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath Moria's East-gate, and at some point in the battle, his shield broke, and, using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which remained with him even in death.

Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850, after his father went missing and died in the dungeons of Dol Guldur.

### Quest for the Lonely Mountain
In TA 2941, Gandalf the Grey found Thorin in The Prancing Pony at Bree and set in motion a scheme to retake the mountain. He gave Thorin a map and key that he had received from Thráin in Dol Guldur before he died. Thorin then took a contingent of twelve Dwarves to visit Bilbo Baggins in order to hire him as a burglar for their mission. Thorin intended to infiltrate the Lonely Mountain and retake the treasure from Smaug.

The Dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf encountered many dangers on their journey to the Lonely Mountain, surviving Trolls, Orcs, Wargs, and Spiders. He found the legendary sword Orcrist in a troll-hoard, along with Glamdring. In Rivendell, the Company rested and Elrond translated the Moon-letters on Thrór's Map. During their journey through Mirkwood, Thorin and his Company encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil. They escaped in barrels and traveled down to Lake-town.

Thorin and Company were greeted warmly by the people of Lake-town and hailed as the return of the King under the Mountain. They soon reached the Lonely Mountain and the Dwarves sent Bilbo inside, who conversed with a newly awakened Smaug. Realizing that the Lake-men must have helped the intruders, an enraged Smaug flew towards Lake-town to take revenge. There he was killed by Bard the Bowman, who pierced the bare spot on Smaug's left breast with his black arrow.

Following the death of Smaug, the people of Lake-town asked Thorin for a share of the treasure, as they wanted recompense for the destruction of their home, a part of Smaug's treasure originating from their former city, and because a man of Lake-town who shot the fatal arrow that killed Smaug. Thorin, overwhelmed by greed after recovering his family's riches, and enraged by the presence of Thranduil, refused to share any part of the treasure. Instead, he sent a Raven to seek aid from his relative, Dáin Ironfoot, who sent a force of Dwarven soldiers on the move to secure the reclaimed mountain city. Meanwhile, Thorin charged his companions with looking for the Arkenstone of Thráin within the hoard of treasure, and gifted Bilbo a Mithril Coat for his bravery. However, Bilbo had already found the Arkenstone, and subsequently, brought it to Bard and Thranduil in secret to use as a bargaining counter.

The growing conflict over the treasure between Dwarves, Elves, and Men, likely to result in bloodshed, was suddenly averted by the approach of goblin and warg armies, so they instead joined forces to defeat their common enemies in what was later called the Battle of Five Armies. During the battle, Thorin led an assault that proved his strength as a leader, striking out from the mountain and providing vital aid as the goblins threatened to overwhelm his allies. He fought courageously, but was mortally wounded in the battle, requiring Beorn to take him to safety.

## Personality
[[File:Thorin king under the mountain by gravity zero-ddur2td.jpg|thumb|200px|left|© by [https://www.deviantart.com/gravity-zero gravity-zero] ]]
Thorin was smart, proud, brave, intelligent, vengeful, and a bit stubborn. He was sophisticated and noble but tended to treat his allies as equals. He was respected by many throughout Middle-earth.

While he initially shared the greed of his family and had an extensive love for gold, he valued the welfare of others as well. He was immensely brave and was willing to give himself up for a just cause, until dragon-sickness came over him.

After succumbing to Dragon-sickness, he seemed to be cruel, stubborn, and vain, and overvalued the treasure of Erebor. He was obsessed with possession of the Arkenstone, since it was the heirloom of his family and part of the Mountain itself. However, in his last moments after the battle, his true noble self returned, and he asked Bilbo for forgiveness. His death had a profound effect on Bilbo, as he had considered Thorin a great friend and brother.

## Weapons
Thorin fought using typical Dwarven axes, a bow, and swords, as well as an Elven blade called *Orcrist*, which was given to him by Gandalf the Grey (Gandalf had found it in a Trolls' lair). Under Thranduil's imprisonment, the blade had been confiscated by the Wood-elves. 

At Thorin's burial, Thranduil decided it was more appropriate to place it on Thorin's tomb, and did so, along with the Arkenstone.

Ľubomír Roman voiced the character in the 1989 Slovak two-episode radio miniseries adaptation of *The Hobbit*.
