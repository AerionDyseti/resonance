# Éothain

**Éothain** was a rider of Rohan.

## History
Éothain was a member of Éomer's éored that overran the orcs who had captured Merry and Pippin at the fringe of Fangorn Forest, and encountered Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli on 30 February, . Éothain scoffed at the idea that Hobbits even existed, believing them to be nothing but a child's tale, and argued against the gift of horses to the three companions.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In one of the last drafts of The Riders of Rohan, Éothain was Éomer's squire, whereas in a later draft of The Ride of the Rohirrim, he was the captain of Éomer's household éored. No reference to Éothain's rank in Éomer's éored is made in *The Lord of the Rings*.

## Etymology
- Éothain* contains the Old English elements *Éoh* ("warhorse") and *thegn* ("warrior, chieftain"). It was a rendition of a Rohanese name that was never recorded, though the first element is likely translated from *lô*/*loh*, "war-horse".
