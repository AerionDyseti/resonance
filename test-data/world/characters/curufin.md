# Curufin

**Curufin** was a Noldorin prince and one of the seven sons of Fëanor. Along with the other sons of Fëanor, he swore the Oath of Fëanor, joined the Exile of the Noldor, and settled in East Beleriand.  

He was Fëanor's favorite son, and resembled him greatly in skill, temperament, and appearance. He was also the father of Celebrimbor, master jewel-smith of Eregion, who forged the three Elvish Rings of Power. 

Curufin was almost always in the company of his brother Celegorm, and the pair are most notable for their role as antagonists in the story of *Beren and Lúthien* where they made foiled attempts to usurp the kingdom of Nargothrond, force Lúthien into marriage to coerce a political alliance with the kingdom of Doriath, and even attacked Beren and Lúthien directly. 

Their misdeeds resulted in the weakening of the Union of Maedhros, which contributed to the disastrous outcome of the fifth battle of Beleriand, Nirnaeth Arnoediad (*Battle of Unnumbered Tears*).

Curufin, alongside his brothers Celegorm and Caranthir, was eventually killed when he and the rest of his brothers attacked Doriath in an effort to reclaim the Silmaril held there.

## History
### Life in Valinor

**Curufin** was a Noldorin prince, one of the seven sons of Fëanor and Nerdanel, born in Valinor during the Time of the Two Trees. He was Fëanor's favorite son, and he greatly resembled Fëanor in temper, talents, and appearance. At some point he married and had a son, Celebrimbor.

Fëanor and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but travelled far and wide upon the confines of Valinor, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the Outer Sea, seeking the unknown. Often they were guests in the halls of Aulë. 

During the unrest of the Noldor and the strife between Fëanor and his half-brother Fingolfin, Fëanor was banished from Tirion and took up residence in Formenos; he was followed by his father, King Finwë, and his sons.

Along with Finwë, the sons of Fëanor did not attend the high feast and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by Melkor and Ungoliant after the pair had killed the Two Trees. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses and lay upon their faces, blind and without strength. Once the cloud passed and they could move again, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen.

They then sped to the Ring of Doom where Maedhros informed Manwë and, unknowingly, also Fëanor who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Fëanor reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Fëanor followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.

Fëanor and his sons soon returned to Tirion where during a great speech by Fëanor, they took a terrible and blasphemous oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dares to claim any part or right in the Silmarils, and led most of the Noldor into exile.

To obtain the ships needed to pursue Morgoth into Middle-earth, Fëanor's host seized them from the Falmari, killing many when they resisted, and thus came under the Doom of Mandos.

After a long march northwards, the Noldor drew close to the Helcaraxë, a land bridge deemed impassable, and the narrow strait between Aman and Middle-earth they intended to sail. With too few ships remaining to ferry all the Noldor at once, and the fear of treachery between their houses, Fëanor and his sons stole away in them, abandoning the host of Fingolfin.

While Curufin's son Celebrimbor joined him in exile, his wife had refused to take part in the rebellion of Fëanor and remained in Aman with the people of Finarfin.

### Return to Middle-earth

After landing at the Firth of Drengist, and burning the ships to prevent any from sailing back, Fëanor's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim where they were attacked unaware by a host of Morgoth. In the battle that followed, Fëanor's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the Mountains of Shadow into Ard-galen.

Though Morgoth's assaulting forces were destroyed, Fëanor recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant orcs, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of Dor Daedeloth. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Maedhros was taken captive after feigning to treat with Morgoth. 

The hatred between the houses began to be assuaged in , when Maedhros was rescued by Fingolfin's son Fingon, and two years later the Noldor held a great common council where Fingolfin was chosen to be overlord of the Noldor. Maedhros subsequently waived his claim to the title, and shortly after relocated the House of Fëanor to East Beleriand. In , Fingolfin held the great Feast of Reuniting where the Elven houses, both Noldor and Sindar, pledged common cause against Morgoth.

### Establishment in Himlad
Curufin and his brother Celegorm held and fortified the realm of Himlad, including the Pass of Aglon. This was situated between King Thingol's realm of Doriath, Maedhros' realm at Himring, and Eöl's realm of Nan Elmoth.

Curufin had a good relationship with the Dwarves, and he bore the knife Angrist, made by the dwarf Telchar of Nogrod, which he wore sheathless by his side. 

Eöl, however, Curufin loved not at all. Curufin was aware of Eöl's resentment towards the Noldor, and that Eöl was using his friendship with the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains, which Curufin was jealous of, to stir up unfriendliness against them. Regardless, Eöl was still allowed to cross through East Beleriand, though a constant watch was placed on Nan Elmoth as they mistrusted his doings and goings.

### Encounters with Aredhel and Eöl

In , while Celegorm and Curufin were riding with Caranthir in Thargelion, their cousin Aredhel, daughter of Fingolfin, arrived at Himlad. The people of Celegorm welcomed her and bade her stay among them with honour until their lord’s return. 

She expressed to Curufin, and later to Celegorm of whom she was most fond, that she escaped from Gondolin of her own will and was glad to dwell with them and be free. The brothers considered sending a message to her brother King Turgon to inform him, but delayed as the route was extremely perilous, she was happy, and Turgon would have demanded her immediate return. Before they could make up their minds though, Aredhel disappeared, having unknowingly crossed into Nam Elmoth during her restless wandering. It was a long time before they knew what happened to her, but they eventually learned once their scouts starting sighting her visiting the borders of Nan Elmoth, or straying beyond them. They chose not to report this to Turgon to avoid his wrath. and the Pass of Aglon was taken, though with great cost to the hosts of Morgoth. Celegorm and Curufin hardly escaped, and passed westward along the north borders of Doriath, with such mounted following as they could save, and came at length to the vale of Sirion. 

Shortly after, Celegorm and Curufin also had to withdraw, and they were harboured in Nargothrond gratefully, the griefs between the House of Finarfin and House of Fëanor now forgotten. and Celegorm and Curufin grew to strong power, leading many of them. Beren arrived at Nargothrond seeking aid on his quest to retrieve a Silmaril from Morgoth to present to King Thingol of Doriath; this was the bride-price named by Thingol for Beren to wed his daughter, Lúthien. Finrod's life had previously been saved by Beren's father, Barahir, and in gratitude he had sworn an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Barahir and his kin. Among Finrod's people only his ten most faithful companions remained willing to join him, and he left his crown to Orodreth to govern in his stead.

Sometime after, evil wolves started to cross the river Narog and entering the Guarded Plain, leading Celegorm and Curufin to hunt them, joined by their riders and Huan, Celegorm's great hound of Valinor. While on the hunt, Curufin secretly spoke to Celegorm of Orodreth being a "dullard slow" and laid out a plot where they could usurp the throne of Nagrothrond in the event of Finrod's death. With no rumour or tidings of Finrod, Curufin suggested that Celegorm should feign another hunt, but with the actual intent to seek out Finrod; through this they would then either confirm his death, or, if by some grace he was alive and bearing a Silmaril, they could kill him and reclaim it before he returned. Either way, the throne would then be theirs as the eldest house among the Noldor. Celegorm listened, but said nothing.

On the third day of their hunt, they had reached near their borders to the west of Doriath and Huan discovered Lúthien and brought her before Celegorm and Curufin. She revealed who she was and of her escape from Doriath in order to rescue Beren, whom she had learned from the visions of her mother Melian was being held prisoner in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Finrod's former fortress of Minas Tirith now occupied by Sauron. Celegorm, immediately enamoured by her beauty, and Curufin both listened, and gave no indication of their awareness of Beren or his quest. Once Lúthien finished, she besought them for their aid. In private counsel, Curufin explained to Celegorm that they now knew that Finrod had been taken prisoner, where the wolves were coming from, and what answer he should give to Lúthien. Celegorm then addressed Lúthien and told her that their hunting party wasn't adequate to assault such a fortress, but that if she came back with them to Nargothrond, they would then devise aid to rescue Beren. Thingol in wrath had sent their letters back by his own servants to Orodreth. 

Though Celegorm attempted to still the clamours of the people, they grew to calls for the brothers to be slain. Brought before Orodreth, Celegorm stood unbowed with scorn and a menacing anger, while Curufin smiled, though wary-eyed and hand on the haft of his knife. Curufin then laughed and, addressing Orodreth as "Sir Steward", noted that they were not accustomed to standing in his hall and requested to know what he sought of them. Orodreth, speaking coldly, stated that they now stood before the king and that they were banished from Nargothrond, and there would never again be love between the realm and the sons of Fëanor. Celegorm and Curufin soon departed and they went alone as none of their people would any longer follow them; even Curufin's son, Celebrimbor, repudiated his fathers deeds and remained behind. Huan, however, still followed his master Celegorm. Additionally, the wounding of Beren caused only half of the House of Haleth that dwelt in Brethil to come forth, and they joined Fingon and Turgon in the west instead of Maedhros. In retaliation, Celegorm and Curufin vowed openly to slay Thingol and destroy his people if they were victorious and the Silmaril (now in Thingol's possession) was not then freely surrendered to them.

## Characteristics
Curufin was Fëanor's favorite son and resembled Fëanor very much in face. He alone showed in some degree the same temper and talents, and was the chief inheritor of his father’s skills. He was known to be of perilous mood,

At the burning of the ships in Losgar, Curufin is the only specifically named individual of the "few of those most close to Fëanor in obedience" who was aroused by Fëanor in setting them aflame. Of all the sons of Fëanor, Curufin is the only one noted as not preferring to use his mother-name. A margin note on the passage of their wolf-hunt states that ''"it is Curufin who put evil into Celegorm's heart"*.

## Other names
Curufin had the sobriquet of "the crafty". ("Skillful Finwë"), the same father-name given to Fëanor. Because Curufin was Fëanor's favorite son, he chose to give him the same name. The short form of this name was ***Curvo***.

His mother-name was ***Atarincë*** ("Little Father"), referring initially to his physical resemblance to his father, and later also found in his mental likeness.

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
In the earliest version of the legendarium in *The Book of Lost Tales*, in the tale of *The Nauglafring*, Curufin goes as a representative of the sons of Fëanor to Dior to bid him to turn over the Silmaril, set within the Nauglafring, in his possession. Dior refuses on the grounds that he could not endure such a despoiling of the Nauglafring, to which Curufin then states that the Nauglafring unbroken must then be given over.  This rises Dior to anger, who bids Curufin to be gone and to instead seek the other two Silmarils still with Melko (Morgoth). As in *The Silmarillion*, the sons of Fëanor then attack Dior's realm, but instead of Celegorm, Caranthir, and Curufin being killed in the battle, here it is Maglor, Dinithel (Amras), Celegorm, and Cranthor (Caranthir).

In third volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, there are many differences in both the events and portrayals of Celegorm and Curufin from the published *Silmarillion*. 
-  In *The Lay of the Children of Húrin* Christopher Tolkien summarizes the multiple shifts of the founding of Nargothrond of which include Celegorm and Curufin founding it after the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and another where they found it after they are routed when Morgoth breaks the Leaguer of Angband, and continue to remain in the east after their host is defeated in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.
-  In *Lay of Leithian Canto VIII* when Curufin and Celegorm come across Lúthien, it is Curufin instead of Celegorm who is enchanted by her. and through that love were even uniquely granted passage to sail with the House of Fëanor after the ships were seized.

In *Maeglin*, from the eleventh volume of *The History of Middle-earth*, Celegorm and Curufin more directly assist Aredhel and Maeglin in their escape from Eöl: Celegorm first provides them with swift horses, and the brothers then waylaid the East Road and its ford over Aros, denying its use to Eöl and delaying him until he escaped them that night in the darkness.

In *The Tale of Years* from the same volume, it was Celegorm and Curufin instead of Beren who intercepted and defeated the Dwarves of Nogrod at the Battle of Sarn Athrad, and were greatly angered to find that a desired Silmaril was not within their treasure looted from the battle in the Thousand Caves. However, Christopher Tolkien comments that this idea was evidently abandoned by his father, since the older idea of Beren fighting the Dwarves and being aided by the Ents appeared again in the Letter 247.

While in the published *Silmarillion* Curufin is recorded as the fifth son of Fëanor, in *The Shibboleth of Fëanor* he is the fourth.
