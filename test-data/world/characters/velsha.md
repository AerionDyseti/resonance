## Overview

Coldscale Shifter Grave Cleric, one of the player characters in the Heroes for Hire campaign. A member of the Ghral-Varin people whose Circle was destroyed by temporal poison.

## Time Pool Visions (Session 9)

### Past (Slow Pool)

Saw themselves with their Circle, back when they were happy—before their death by the explosion's poison gas.

### Present (Medium Pool)

Saw the Glen; learned the Shifters are only just now discovering the death of their Circle.

### Future (Fast Pool)

Saw themselves worn and tired, covered in memory-tokens of dozens of people with strange names—a Coldscales tradition honoring those they couldn't save. This is foreshadowing of their life if they return to the Age of Enlightenment.

## The Circle's Death

Vel'Sha's entire Circle was killed by noxious fumes from an explosion that hasn't happened yet. The poison gas from the coming green star catastrophe traveled backward through time and killed them in the past. Vel'Sha's quest for answers is directly tied to uncovering the source of this disaster.
