# Tar-Palantir

**Tar-Palantir** was the twenty-fourth King of Númenor.

## Biography
Though Tar-Palantir's father, Ar-Gimilzôr, was an opponent of the Valar and the Elves, his mother Inzilbêth taught Tar-Palantir to be an admirer of the Elves. Even by his enemies he was recognized to be a true seer, prophesying that the fate of the White Tree, Nimloth, was tied to that of the House of Elros.

Ar-Inziladûn took power during a time of great darkness in Númenor; ever since Tar-Atanamir, many kings had spoken against the Valar and turned instead to greed and empire building in Middle-earth. Tar-Palantir, however, sought to repent the actions of his predecessors; he took his regnal name in Quenya, once again tended to the White Tree and followed the ancient practices honoring Eru Ilúvatar. However, there was no response from the Valar, and the view of Tol Eressëa from Tar-Minastir's tower was shrouded.

His daughter, Tar-Míriel was his heir and would have followed his policies, but her rightful place as Queen of Númenor was usurped when she was married forcibly by her cousin, Ar-Pharazôn.

## Etymology
His name in Quenya was written in the Scrolls, as it was with the ancient practices. ***Palantir*** in Quenya means "far sighted", as Palantir indeed saw the destruction that would come to Númenor if it continued down its path of disobedience to the Valar. His Adûnaic name was **Ar-Inziladûn**, which means "Flower of the West".

## In adaptations
In , set in an alternate Second Age, Tar-Palantir was forced from the throne for his attempts to return Númenor to its former ways of honoring the Valar, and remains king while his daughter Míriel rules in his stead as Queen-regent. By the time Galadriel is brought to Númenor, he is quite ill and confined to his bed in the King's Tower; Míriel warns him that Galadriel has arrived and attempts to send the Elf back to Middle-earth alone. However, when the leaves of Nimloth begin to fall, Míriel decides instead to involve Númenor in the affairs of Middle-earth, and Tar-Palantir suddenly feels that something fateful has occurred. He advises Míriel against going to Middle-earth, warning her that darkness awaits her there. After she ignores this warning, this prophecy holds true for Míriel when she is blinded by Orodruin's eruption.

Before Míriel's return, Tar-Palantir's health declines further, leading Pharazôn to bring draftsmen from across Númenor to design a tomb for him. A number of apprentices are given an hour each alone with the king to sketch his likeness, and during Eärien's allotment, Tar-Palantir mistakes her for Míriel and unlocks the high tower chamber, warning her of the palantír there. He dies soon afterwards, causing Pharazôn to ponder his next move.
