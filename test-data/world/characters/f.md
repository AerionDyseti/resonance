# F

In a manuscript by J.R.R. Tolkien, a Nazgûl simply labeled "**F**" accompanied Khamûl in tracking the Shire-hobbits during the Hunt for the Ring.

## History
Like the other Nazgûl, "F" By  "F" and the other eight Men who had received rings of power first appeared as Ringwraiths.

In , when Sauron declared himself openly to his enemies, "F" was probably one of the two Ringwraiths under Khamûl's command that were sent to Dol Guldur.

In the evening of 23 September, after the Nazgûl approach near the Three-Farthing Stone in the Shire,

On 25 September, "F" was summoned by Khamûl with cries after failing to find Frodo Baggins on the ridge above Woodhall. Together, they ride east over the fields and visit Farmer Maggot. After leaving Farmer Maggot, "F" was sent off by Khamûl to head down the Causeway in the direction of the Overbourn Marshes. "F" reached the Bucklebury Ferry at night soon after Khamûl arrived too late to the catch the Hobbits before they crossed the Brandywine River.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In an early draft of *The Lord of the Rings* labeled "Scheme D", Tolkien identified each Nazgûl by letters between A and I. It is not known which of these early draft labels correspond with "F". The Nazgûl trailing "the hobbits in the Shire" were labeled "**D**" and "**E**" respectively.
## Portrayal in adaptations
'*1987: *Middle-earth Role Playing—Lords of Middle-earth: Vol. II*:*'
:Adûnaphel is mentioned in the supplement as one of the Ringwraiths sent to Dol Guldur, as well as being the only of that group to accompany Khamûl in the Shire, which would likely make her "F".
