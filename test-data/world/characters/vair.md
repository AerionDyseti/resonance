# Vairë

**Vairë** (Quenya; IPA:  or  - "Weaver") was an Ainu and Vala responsible for the weaving of the story of Arda.

## Biography
Vairë was counted among the Valier, the Queens of the Valar, though she was not as great in power or prestige as some. Her "storied webs" covered the Halls of Mandos, where she apparently lived with Mandos, her husband.

## Etymology
In Quenya, ***Vairë*** means "Weaver", and was derived from the Primitive Quendian *weirē*, which derives from the root *wey* ("weave, wind"). Her Ñoldorin name is **Gwîr**, from *gwi* ("net, web").
