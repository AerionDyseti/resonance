# Radagast

**Radagast** (Adûnaic: "Tender Of Beasts")** the Brown** was one of five Wizards sent to Middle-earth to contest the will of Sauron. Originally a Maia of Yavanna, Radagast mainly concerned himself with the well-being of the plant and animal worlds, and thus did not participate heavily in the War of the Ring.

## Biography
### Years of the Lamps

Originally named **Aiwendil** (Quenya: "Friend to birds"), Radagast was a Maia created before Time who descended into Arda to serve the Valar. Aiwendil served the Valië Yavanna, Queen of the earth.

When the Undying Lands were separated from Arda after the Downfall of Númenor, Manwë was still concerned for the fate of the peoples of Middle-earth. Though Sauron had been overthrown, he had not been permanently vanquished. In time, his shadow began to emerge again. A council of the Valar was summoned, and it was decided that they would send emissaries to Middle-earth. These messengers should be "mighty peers of Sauron, yet forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh," as they were intended to help Men and Elves unite against Sauron. These emissaries themselves, the wizards, did not match the Dark Lord in power. Aulë chose Curumo (Saruman), Oromë chose Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards), and Manwë chose Olórin (Gandalf). Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him.

### Third Age
#### Arrival in Middle-earth
Around the year TA 1000, the Maia arrived at the Grey Havens in the west of Eriador, having the form of old Men, whom the peoples called Wizards. Curumo arrived first and alone, and Aiwendil arrived at the same time as Olórin. When the Wizards took their mission, they roamed Middle-earth. In this period, Aiwendil was renamed "Radagast" by the Ñoldor and became known for both his protection of the great Forests and his zeal for the animals, worrying little with the affairs of Men and Elves, but was far more knowledgeable in plants, birds and beasts in the forest. He also turned away from Saruman during this period, unaware that the White Wizard despised him and considered him a fool.

In general, Radagast was never much of a traveler. There is little told of his early journeys, but by the late Third Age, he had settled down and dwelt for a time at Rhosgobel, somewhere between the Carrock and the Menn-i-Naugrim. 

#### War of the Ring
In TA 2851, the White Council met once more, after which Saruman began to search the Gladden Fields for the One Ring. Radagast decided to aid his search, with birds and beasts acting as spies, hoping that Saruman's actions would help keep watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's true ambition to acquire and keep the Ring for himself.

By the War of the Ring, Radagast no longer dwelt in Rhosgobel. In summer of TA 3018, Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to help Gandalf and sent the Brown Wizard to seek Gandalf at once. Radagast knew little of Eriador but sought for the Shire, knowing that he would find Gandalf nearby. His fate after the War of the Ring is untold, The similarity to Old English *rudugást* meaning "red-brown spirit" has also been noted by fans.

## Character

Tolkien's writing does not shed much light on Radagast's personality. In the books, little is known about Radagast apart from certain defining characteristics. Saruman was the chief of the Order of Wizards and Gandalf came next in the order; Radagast meanwhile held much less power and wisdom.

Radagast displayed some qualities of innocence and naivety, making him an ideal accomplice of Saruman's plans, seen in providing his services to help the White examine the Gladden Fields. Saruman in turn considered him simple (minded) and a fool and can be heard saying that he (Radagast) acted in a manner contrary to how an Istari should behave. However, he was fundamentally good and honest and therefore did not fall to the shadow, but did fail in his appointed task. In , Tolkien writes that "indeed of all the Istari, one only remained faithful," referring to Gandalf.

## Abilities
In the books, during the Council of Elrond, Gandalf referred to Radagast as "*master of shapes and changes of hue*", but the meaning of this is open to question. He was wiser than any man in all things concerning herbs and animals. It is said that he spoke many languages of birds and was a friend to them and all animals.

## Behind the scenes
It is unknown if Radagast left Middle-earth. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote that he forsook his mission as one of the Wizards by becoming too obsessed with animals and plants, so presumably failing, perhaps being disallowed to return to Valinor with honour.

Early in the process of writing , it is clear that Tolkien envisaged some role for Radagast in the tale. He eventually decided that he would use Radagast as the means of getting Gandalf to Isengard.

Initially Gandalf describes Radagast as his 'cousin', In the final version Gandalf merely says that Radagast is 'one of my order'.

When Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on the future story development; therein he considered handing over Isengard to Radagast.

## In adaptations
### BBC Radio's *The Lord of the Rings* (1981)
Donald Gee provided the voice of Radagast in the BBC . He is introduced much earlier than in the book because his meeting with Gandalf is given chronologically.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

The character Radagast and virtually all references to him were not used in the theatrical release of  directed by Peter Jackson. The character is also absent from the  of the same name.

Radagast does appear in Peter Jackson's , although no scene involving him is corroborated by Tolkien's writings. In the , Radagast is mentioned only once in passing, as Gandalf's cousin. In the films, he is portrayed by actor Sylvester McCoy of *Doctor Who* fame.

Radagast is portrayed as having an eccentric personality, but is also selfless and brave, as when seen healing the hedgehog Sebastian and when waylaying an Orc pack so that Thorin and Company could go to Rivendell. He is also highly intelligent, being a Wizard, having an adept understanding of nature and ability to perform healing spells and magical blasts. Radagast's fidgety and slightly hyperactive speech pattern is somewhat of a trademark of actor Sylvester McCoy, who has a history of playing eccentric and comedic characters.

#### *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*
Radagast is first mentioned in  when Bilbo Baggins inquires of Gandalf whether there are any other wizards within Middle-earth. Gandalf responds that there are five wizards, of whom Radagast is one. Gandalf says that Radagast is a great wizard in his own particular way, also calling him a kind-hearted individual enjoying the solitude of standing guard over the Greenwood forest and preferring the company of animals to that of Men.

Radagast is then seen investigating the Greenwood, noticing that much of the vegetation is beginning to decay and much of the animal life is sick or dying. Radagast brings one of them, a hedgehog he calls Sebastian, back to his woodland house at Rhosgobel where he is able to nurse the hedgehog back to health. Radagast comes to the realization that a type of powerful witchcraft has caused the decay of the Greenwood and its transformation into what would now become known as Mirkwood. After Rhosgobel is swarmed by Giant Spiders and he manages to save Sebastian, Radagast investigates and identifies the origin of the evil as the supposedly abandoned fortress of Dol Guldur.

Radagast makes his way to Dol Guldur aboard a sled pulled by Rhosgobel rabbits. While Radagast is investigating Dol Guldur, he is attacked by the spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar. Radagast is able to ward off his attacks and forces the Witch-king to drop his Morgul-blade and retreat. But before Radagast could take a moment to breathe, he immediately senses another danger and turns to see a shadowy figure within the fortress, whom he believes to be the Necromancer. Without hesistation, Radagast grabs the Morgul-blade before fleeing out of the ruins. Sensing the danger as well, Radagast's sled of Rhosgobel rabbits take off without their master, forcing the wizard to run on foot to catch up before eventually grabbing the reins. Fighting off the resident bats, Radagast manages to make a difficult escape.

He immediately goes on the search for Gandalf to inform him of the newfound threat within Mirkwood and is able to locate him within the Trollshaws accompanying Thorin and Company. Radagast tells Gandalf of the threat the Necromancer poses to Middle-earth from within Dol Guldur and presents the Morgul-blade as evidence. Shortly afterwards, the company is attacked by a battalion of Warg-riders led by Yazneg. Radagast volunteers to create a diversion with his sled of Rhosgobel rabbits, drawing the Warg-riders away from Thorin and company, who are able to reach the safety of the Hidden Valley of Rivendell. Radagast's rabbit sled's superiority in speed and maneuverability allows him to escape the Warg-riders before they are driven off by Elven horsemen led by Elrond.

At the White Council meeting in Rivendell, Gandalf backs Radagast's claim that the Necromancer poses a serious threat to Middle-earth. But the head of the White Council, the white wizard Saruman, remains skeptical and claims there is no evidence to support such a theory despite Radagast's finding of the Morgul-blade. Saruman sneers in contempt and suggests that excessive consumption of mushrooms has addled Radagast's judgement and reduced his reliability.

#### *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug*
In , Radagast meets Gandalf inside the High Fells of Rhudaur and they find the tombs (or cells) of the Nazgûl broken into by 'dark spells'.

Radagast is sceptical of Gandalf's beliefs that the Necromancer summoned the Nazgûl to Dol Guldur, believing that no human sorcerer could accomplish this. However, Gandalf reminded him that the Nazgûl only answer to their one true master, Sauron, whom he suspects is the true identity of the Necromancer. Realizing that Sauron plans on attacking the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf attempts to leave to rejoin Thorin and Company, but Radagast insists that they investigate Dol Guldur themselves assuming what Gandalf believes is true. Upon arriving at the seemingly abandoned fortress, Gandalf guessed that a spell of concealment had been erected over the place, suspecting that their enemy has not regained his full strength. Gandalf sends Radagast to take a message to Lady Galadriel while Gandalf continues his own investigation of the 'abandoned' fortress. Before Gandalf goes in, he has Radagast swear not to save him should anything happen, especially believing it to be a trap.

#### *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*
In the , Radagast is seen chanting an incantation, seemingly a telepathic communication to support Gandalf as he attempts to break free from his cage. Later, he arrives at Dol Guldur where he takes Gandalf to his sled, by the order of Galadriel. Radagast provides Gandalf a horse to ride to Erebor and his Wizard's staff to replace his old one. Gandalf tells Radagast to summon every bird and beast to join in the battle for the Lonely Mountain. Radagast leads a charge of the Great Eagles at the end of the battle to assist the Dwarves, Men, and Elves. He rides one of the eagles (possibly Gwaihir) along with Beorn.

Evil men then captured some of the Beornings and tortured the secret out of them, creating two distinct tribes of people: the Gauredain, Men of the Wolf, and Ungoledain, Men of the Spider. Radagast regretted what had happed and used every opportunity to take the art back from the people who stole it against his will, but both tribes persisted in the untamed wilderness. During his stay in Rhosgobel, Radagast had come across Gollum who was stealing and eating the babies of the Woodmen and banished him from the Vales of Anduin, causing Gollum to crawl inside the caverns of the Misty Mountains.
