# Fíli and Kíli

**Fíli** and **Kíli** were Dwarven brothers and were also the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly Bombur, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's *The Hobbit* than the rest of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.

## Biography
Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother, Dís. They were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes, and were often sent scouting or searching. It was they that found the Front Porch while in the Misty Mountains.

With the other Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli encountered spiders and were later imprisoned by the Elvenking Thranduil. They escaped the cells thanks to Bilbo, traveling down the river in barrels until they reached Lake-town. The brothers accompanied Thorin and Bilbo to Lake-town while the others rested by the river.

At the feet of the Lonely Mountain, Fíli and Kíli scouted Ravenhill and found the Front Gate with Balin and Bilbo. Also, with Bilbo, they found the side-door leading into the mountain.

Both brothers were killed while defending the mortally wounded Thorin Oakenshield in the Battle of Five Armies, and all three were later buried with honor.

## Talents & equipment

While on journeys, Fíli and Kíli both wore blue hoods, and played fiddles. They each carried a spade, presumably to forage, and to aid in building firepits, barriers, and traps. While the books make no mention of Kíli carrying a bow, it is presumed by some readers that he was skilled with it.

## Behind the scenes

Though Fíli is described as the youngest in Chapter 8 of *The Hobbit*, in Appendix A of  his birth year is given as TA 2859 whereas Kíli's is given as TA 2864.
## In adaptations

### Rankin/Bass films
In the animated version of *The Hobbit*, their roles are relatively minor compared to the book and have few lines; both brothers are voiced by Don Messick.thumb|250px|Fíli and Kíli at Bag End

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy, Fíli is portrayed by Dean O'Gorman and Kíli by Aidan Turner. While in the book they both have yellow hair and beards, in the films, only Fíli has golden hair, while Kíli has dark brown, almost black hair (an Orc refers to him as "the black-haired archer"). The following is from information released by the studio:

- Younger brother to Fíli, Kíli is a loyal nephew to Thorin Oakenshield. Carefree and somewhat reckless, Kíli has led a charmed and untroubled life to this point. Handsome and physically able, Kíli possesses the invincible courage of youth. He is a skilled fighter and expert archer, having been trained with weapons from an early age. As one of the youngest of the Company of Dwarves, Kíli is determined to make his mark and prove his worth.*

As in the books, Fíli and Kíli serve as the scouts of the Company. It is they who discover the ponies have gone missing in the Trollshaws and investigate the Trolls with Bilbo. Kíli is distinguished as the only member of the Company who carries a bow (unlike in the book, which implies more than one Dwarf had a bow), and he is shown to have proficient aim, taking out several Wargs when the Company are attacked on their way to Rivendell.

Fíli and Kíli are also shown as being some of the more adept fighters of the company. They, along with Dwalin, charge to the defence of Bilbo and attack Azog's wargs when cornered on the clifftop. Kíli also kills Grinnah in the fight in the caves where Goblin-town is located.

In *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug*, a romantic subplot develops between Kíli and Tauriel, a Silvan Elf who is a captain of Thranduil's guard in Mirkwood. When Kíli is surrounded by several Spiders and is left with no weapons to defend himself, Elves, led by Legolas and Tauriel, arrive and rescue Kíli from the spiders. Later, Tauriel notices Kíli holding a small talisman and inquires about it. He tells her that the talisman reminds him of the promise to return he made to his mother, Dís. They begin to talk, with Tauriel telling of her Elven love for the stars, and Kíli telling of the time he saw a great blood-moon (presumably a lunar eclipse), while Legolas listens unobserved from the shadows.

Soon the Company is rescued by Bilbo, using barrels from the wine cellars to escape. In the river they are stopped by the Elven-guard, who swing shut a portcullis across a narrow place in the river to block their passage, when suddenly both Elves and Dwarves are attacked by Bolg and his Orc troops. Kíli climbs up to operate the mechanism for opening the portcullis and is injured by an arrow to the leg. Tauriel saves him once again, Kíli is able to open the portcullis, and he continues down the river with the rest of the Company. Later Tauriel, having learned from an Orc captive that the arrow wounding Kíli was poisoned, follows the Dwarves (accompanied by Legolas) in order to save him.

In Lake-town, Kíli becomes gravely ill from the poisoned arrow and Thorin orders him left behind. Óin stays behind to tend him, and, when Fíli fails to change Thorin's mind, he defies his uncle in order to stay behind as well to be with his brother. Bofur is also left behind, having waken up too late after the Dwarves drunken celebration the night before. The Dwarves take refuge in Bard's home. Óin asks Bard if there is any kingsfoil and Bard says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so Bofur sets off to get some. Meanwhile, Bolg arrives and attacks the place, searching for Thorin. Legolas and Tauriel arrive just in time to kill the Orcs. As Legolas runs after the escaping Bolg, Tauriel stays and uses the kingsfoil Bofur has brought back (which she recognizes as athelas) to tend to Kíli's wound. Kíli, half in delirium, watches Tauriel as she heals him, speaking aloud of her beauty (to himself, as though believing himself to be in a dream) and wondering whether she could ever love him. Tauriel seems quite touched, and they hold hands.

In *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, Fíli and Kíli survive the attack on Lake-town by Smaug, and proceed to Erebor along with Bofur and Óin. During the Battle of Five Armies, Thorin takes Fíli, Kíli, and Dwalin to pursue Azog. Thorin sends Fíli and Kíli to scout, not knowing they are about to be overrun by a second army of Gundabad Orcs. Bilbo comes to warn them, but it is too late. Fíli is the first one to be captured, and is later impaled by Azog in front of Thorin, Bilbo, and Dwalin, much to the horror of the latter three. Kíli, who is hiding underneath, sees the body of Fíli drop down. He attacks the Orcs in rage, and is later confronted by Bolg. He saves Tauriel from being attacked by Bolg, but is mortally wounded during the fight. Kíli dies with Tauriel by his side. Bolg is eventually killed by Legolas while Azog is killed by Thorin himself avenging the brothers.

#### Non-canonical Weapons

As shown in *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug* film, Fíli wields various weapons and hides them in his person. His most commonly used weapons are dual swords, knives, throwing axes, and a war hammer. Kíli, on the other hand, is the Company's archer, but is also shown using a sword.

### Voice dubbing actors

### Video games
- In *The Hobbit: Armies of the Third Age*, Kíli appears as the first hero in the Dwarf faction.
