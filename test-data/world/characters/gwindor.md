# Gwindor

**Gwindor** was an Elf of Nargothrond in the First Age. He was the son of Guilin and a Prince of Nargothrond.

## Biography

Gwindor was credited with beginning the Nírnaeth Arnoediad when, at the sight of his brother Gelmir's brutal murder at the hands of Orcs, he rashly charged the hosts of Morgoth on the plains of Anfauglith by his own will. He was ultimately captured when Morgoth's reserves were set forth from the fortress and the armies of Men and Elves were overrun. He was enslaved and put into one of the stone-gangs of Angband for seventeen years (FA 472 -489).

Gwindor later escaped Angband, but his hand was cut off in a fight with a guard. The injury devastated Gwindor and he fell into despair in the wilderness, and nearly died of the wound. He was rescued by Beleg and his will to live returned. He later helped Beleg free Túrin and, after Beleg's tragic and accidental death, Gwindor found himself trying to rouse Túrin as Beleg had roused him. He brought Túrin to Nargothrond, and in time would counsel against Túrin's policy of open warfare against Morgoth, but was ignored. He loved the Elf Finduilas, but found himself unfit to wed her, and an engagement between them was broken. He grew jealous of Túrin since she loved him more, and felt Túrin had gained respect from the council at his expense. He warned Finduilas that Túrin was cursed and would bring doom to the people he loved. Nevertheless, Gwindor pitied and loved him.

He was mortally wounded in the Battle of Tumhalad, the last battle of Nargothrond. Túrin abandoned the battle and bore him to safety, but his wounds could not be healed. Gwindor died reproaching Túrin for his pride and pleading him to save Finduilas, who alone stood between Túrin and his doom.

## Etymology

***Gwindor*** consists of the Ñoldorin word *gwind* ("pale blue"), or in Quenya, *vinya* ("young"). *Dor* has several meanings ("high, lofty, noble, king, or master").

## In other versions

In *The Book of Lost Tales Part Two*, **Flinding** was Gwindor's name; and he was the son of Fuilin. He first appears when Túrin kills Beleg by accident.
