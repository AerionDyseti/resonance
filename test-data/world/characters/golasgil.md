# Golasgil

**Golasgil** was the lord of Anfalas during the War of the Ring.

## History
Golasgil led a long line of men to Minas Tirith before the Battle of Pelennor Fields.  All that he commanded - hunters, herdsmen, and villagers - were scantily equipped save for his own household. However, since he was not mentioned among the fallen in the Song of the Mounds of Mundburg it appears that he did survive the great battle.

## Portrayal in adaptations

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Golasgil is first met on the second level of Minas Tirith, overlooking the training of his soldiers before the battle. He participates in the defence of the city during the siege and later fights in the Battle of Pelennor Fields. During the battle he is separated from his allies, but is able to fend off a party of orcs by himself and survives. He joins the Army of the West and follows Aragorn's command to the Black Gate of Mordor. During the Battle of the Morannon Golasgil is killed by a large Olog-hai. He is survived by his wife, Lady Marra, and his young son Orgolas.
