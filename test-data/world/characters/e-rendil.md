# Eärendil

**Eärendil the Mariner** was one of the Half-elven, and an important figure in the legends of the Elder Days. Descended from all Three Houses of the Edain, he was the first known person to reach Aman in the First Age after the Noldor went into exile. He was crucial in the War of Wrath and the patriarch of the line of the Kings of Númenor through his son Elros. 

## History

The son of Tuor and Idril, daughter of King Turgon, Eärendil was raised as a child in Gondolin. Eärendil was seven years old when Gondolin fell, and narrowly escaped death at the hands of his kinsman Maeglin during the battle. He was borne out on the shoulders of Idril's house-carle Hendor. As they rested in Nan-tathren, the waters of Ulmo awoke the sea-longing in both father and son.

He lived afterwards in Arvernien by the Havens of Sirion. Eärendil later became the leader of the people who lived there, and married Elwing, daughter of Dior, the son of Beren and Lúthien. They had two sons, Elrond and Elros.

With the aid of Círdan the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship, *Vingilótë* (or *Vingilot*), and sailed around the seas west of Middle-earth for two purposes: to seek after Tuor and Idril who did not return, and to perhaps find Aman and so bring the message of Elves and Men to the Valar in the West before he died - resulting him leaving his wife behind in Arvernien. At this time Elwing had in her possession the Silmaril that Beren had wrested from Morgoth. News of this came to the remaining sons of Fëanor, and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, killing most of them. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself and the Silmaril into the sea. The Silmaril was not lost, however:

Hearing of the tragedy that had befallen in Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after Valinor, and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil then went before the Valar, and asked them to aid the Men and Elves in Middle-earth and fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea.

Because Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, Manwë forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due. Because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the Half-elven). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves.

The Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth and overthrew Morgoth, binding him with a chain forged by the smith Aulë. Eärendil took part in the battle. His ship Vingilótë was blessed by the Valar, filled with a shining white flame, and sent to the skies. He sailed at its helm with the Silmaril bound upon his brow. Alongside Thorondor and the Eagles, he slew the great dragon Ancalagon the Black and cast his body down onto Thangorodrim, the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the War of Wrath, led to the Ruin of Beleriand.

## Legacy

Eärendil lived in Valinor, and the gleaming of the Silmaril upon his brow could still be seen in the skies of the distant West as the bright Evening Star. Those who remained in Middle-earth called it **Gil-Estel** (S. "Star of High Hope").

In the Second Age, the descendants of the Edain followed the Star of Eärendil to reach Elenna. When Númenor fell under the Shadow, Tar-Atanamir mentioned Eärendil's fate to argue about immortality to the Messengers of the Valar. The Messengers responded that his was a fate apart as a Half-elven, and he was bound to the sky, unable to return, whereas the Númenóreans demanded the liberties of both Elves and Men.

Bilbo Baggins wrote the *Eärendillinwë* and the legend of Eärendil also inspired the poem *Errantry*.

## Etymology

- Eärendil* was his given father-name. *Eärendil* is a Quenya name, meaning "Devoted to the Sea", literally "Sea lover". It is a compound of *eär* and *-ndil*.

Tolkien used the original Old English name ***Eärendel*** for his early Legendarium, which he envisioned as Elvish, derived form the Qenya words *ea* ("eagle") and *earen* ("eyre"); the exact meaning of the name remained unclear.

## Other names
The Sindarin cognate for *Eärendil* was ***Gaerdil***, with variations like *Gaerdilion* and *Gaerennil*. There are also experimental Sindarized forms, such as *Aerendil* and *Aerennel*, as well as a direct translation: *Seron Aearon*.

- Eärendil* was translated as ***Azrubêl*** in Adûnaic, from *azar* ("sea") and the stem *bel-*.

Eärendil was known by many epithets: Half-elven, the Blessed, Bright,

## Genealogy

## Other versions of the legendarium
### Early poems
Before conceiving any story for his mythology, Tolkien wrote some poems that dealt with Eärendel. The earliest was *Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast*, which would set the foundations for *The Book of Lost Tales* as Tolkien "tried to find out" what it was about. The other poems were *The Bidding of the Minstrel*, *The Shores of Faëry* and *The Happy Mariners*, all written between 1914-1915. The four poems tell in a lyric way about the coming of Eärendel to Valinor, the rising of his boat as the morning star and his everlasting travel in the edge of the world. 

- The Bidding of the Minstrel* is associated with a noted page, which outlines the travels of Eärendel to the North, visiting Island, Iceland, magic lands and seeing Kôr from afar; then he goes South, travelling through the Mediterranean or Atlantic sea, full of strange creatures. Then he travels to the western lip of the world and sails upon the sky, never coming back. *The Shores of Faëry* has a short preface in prose, which, as in the former text, conceives Eärendel as an old man when travelling to the firmament. Years later, the wishes of the Valar were fulfilled when Eärendel was born from Tuor and Idril in Gondolin:

Now Eärendel was still of tender years when the Fall of Gondolin began. The red lights of the enemy appeared in the walls of his room, which made him cry, as his nurse Meleth had told him dark stories about Melko. His mother Idril came and arrayed him with a tiny coat of mail, which cheered him up greatly.

- Earendel* is also mentioned in The Notion Club Papers, where Tolkien finally changed the name to *Earendil*, and remained so.

## Inspiration
right|thumb|100px|One of the three heraldic devices J.R.R. Tolkien designed for Eärendil
While *Eärendil* is a Quenya name inside the legendarium, Tolkien created the name based on Anglo-Saxon *éarendel*. He says that he was struck by the "great beauty" of the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as "entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language."

Tolkien was also aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse *Aurvandill*, Lombardic *Auriwandalo*), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in *The Notion Club Papers*. The Old Norse together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun (in *Crist* christianized to refer to John the Baptist).

Tolkien was particularly inspired by the lines in *Christ*, which became the title of his first poem about Eärendel:

This first line is paralleled by Eönwë when Eärendil reaches Aman: "*Hail Eärendil, of mariners most renowned, [...] Hail Eärendil, bearer of light before the Sun and Moon!*". which translates as "Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!". Frodo's exclamation was in reference to the "Star-glass" he carried, which contained the light of Eärendil's star, the Silmaril he wore upon his brow.
