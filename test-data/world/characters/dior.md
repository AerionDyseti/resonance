# Dior

**Dior** was the son of Beren and Lúthien, and the grandson and heir to the throne of Elu Thingol, King of Doriath. Dior was the first of the Peredhil. 

## History
Dior was born on the island of Tol Galen in East Beleriand. When he was 27, he married Nimloth of Doriath, and took her back to live by the Lanthir Lamath waterfall at the base of the Blue Mountains. There, they had three children: Elwing, Eluréd, and Elurín. 

After Thingol was slain by the Dwarves who coveted the Nauglamír, Dior with his father and a host of Green-elves of Ossiriand journeyed swiftly north to the river Ascar and fought the Dwarves of Nogrod in the Battle of Sarn Athrad.

In , he and his family went to Menegroth and restored the realm of Doriath. After the death of his parents, a lord of the Laiquendi came to Doriath bringing the Nauglamír, which was worn by his mother. After mourning, he decided to wear it himself. When he placed the Nauglamír on himself, it sat lightly and he appeared as the fairest of three living races: Maiar, Elves, and Men. This news came to the Sons of Fëanor, who came to Doriath with their followers, consumed by the Oath of Fëanor.

## Etymology
In the *Etymologies*, the name *Dior* is said to mean "successor" in Doriathrin. The name derives from Primitive Quendian *ndeuro* ("follower, successor"), from root NDEW.

## Other names
Dior was first called ***Aranel***, probably Sindarin for ("Elf King"). Later he was called ***Eluchíl*** ("Heir of Elu") and **the Fair**.

## Genealogy

### Dior's Fate

Christopher Tolkien interprets it as that Dior would inherit his father's mortality, irrespective of his mother's nature and choice:
