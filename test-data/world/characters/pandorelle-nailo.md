## Overview

Pandorelle Nailo was a half-elven bard and the Dragonmarked of Atheros (Light) during the Darkness Wars (730-738 MR). Known among his fellow Dragonmarked as the "moral pet" of the party, he served as the conscience and emotional anchor for heroes who often dealt in shades of gray. A devoted follower of Sol (Ahnas), he brought hope and light to the darkest moments of the war.

He is credited with designing the **Coalition sigil**—the modified symbol of Sol that unified the multinational alliance against the encroaching darkness.

## Background

Pandorelle traveled with the other Dragonmarked throughout the eight-year war, chronicling their deeds in song and verse while providing moral guidance when the weight of their choices threatened to overwhelm them. His half-elven heritage gave him perspective on both human urgency and elven patience, making him uniquely suited to bridge the diverse peoples united under the Coalition banner.

As a bard, he was a collector of stories, songs, and keepsakes. He maintained a journal throughout the war, documenting not just events but his observations about his companions—their struggles, their hopes, and his worries for them.

## Death

During a mission against a Vampire Lord, Pandorelle was captured and turned into a vampire as an act of vengeance against the Dragonmarked. Rather than exist as a monster—the antithesis of everything he believed in—**Pandorelle walked into the sun and met his death on his own terms.**

His primary belongings were with him when he was turned. However, before the final assault, he had left personal effects at a Coalition waystation in the Solaar Desert, intending to retrieve them on the return journey.

He never came back.

## Personal Effects (Waystation Cache)

Pandorelle's effects remained sealed in a chest at the Coalition waystation for over 800 years, undiscovered until the present day. The chest bears Sol's symbol and contains:

**Journal**

A leather-bound book containing:

- Sketches and iterations of the Coalition sigil design
- Songs about the Dragonmarked (some finished, some fragmentary)
- Personal observations about his companions
- Entries expressing worry for Lianaaniel and her bond with her dragon Karasi
- A final entry expressing hope for victory and plans to return

**Unfinished Song: "The Shadow and the Sea"**

A half-completed composition about an elven sorceress and her dragon. The melody notation stops mid-phrase.

**Secondary Instrument**

A well-crafted lute, not his primary performance instrument but one he treasured.

**Small Keepsakes**

Personal tokens that those who knew him would recognize.

## Journal Excerpts

### On the Coalition Sigil

> *"Must represent all nations. No one above another. Unity without submission."*
> 

### On Lianaaniel

> *"Lia frightens me sometimes. Not because of the shadows—I've made peace with what she can do. It's how much she loves Karasi. I've never seen devotion like that. It's beautiful. It's terrifying.*
> 

> 
> 

> *What happens to someone who loves that completely, if they ever lose it?*
> 

> 
> 

> *I hope I never find out. I hope she never has to."*
> 

### Final Entry

> *"Waystation secured. Leaving my things here—traveling light for the assault. The Vampire Lord won't expect us coming from the south.*
> 

> 
> 

> *Strange to feel hopeful. We've lost so much. But I think we're going to win this. I think we're going to see the other side.*
> 

> 
> 

> *I'm looking forward to coming back. To finishing the song. To seeing what the world looks like without all this darkness.*

> *Sol willing, I'll be back in a fortnight."*

## Legacy

The Coalition sigil Pandorelle designed flew over the united armies of Enym throughout the Darkness Wars and continues to be found on artifacts, documents, and equipment from that era. His songs about the Dragonmarked survive in fragmentary form, passed down through bardic traditions.

His journal, if discovered, would provide invaluable insight into the Dragonmarked heroes and the war that shaped modern Enym—as well as a deeply personal connection to someone who chose death over darkness.

## Relationships

- **Lianaaniel** — Fellow Dragonmarked (Karasi/Water). Pandorelle worried deeply about the intensity of her bond with her dragon.
- **Isis of Sol** — Fellow Dragonmarked (Temnis/Order). Approved his Coalition sigil design.
- **Other Dragonmarked** — Served as moral anchor for the party, documenting their struggles in song and verse.
