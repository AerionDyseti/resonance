# Gwaihir

**Gwaihir** was the greatest of the Eagles of the North Middle-earth  and the swiftest of the Great Eagles at the time of the War of the Ring.

## History
Gwaihir was the mightiest of the descendants of Thorondor and the brother of Landroval.

During the War of the Ring, Radagast rode in the direction of Mirkwood where he had many old friends. The Eagles set off and gathered news: wolves and Orcs gathering and mustering, the movements of the Nine Riders, and the escape of Gollum from Mirkwood. After Gandalf recovered, he sent Gwaihir to watch the Anduin and gather tidings.

Gwaihir, Landroval and Meneldor and other great eagles helped the Free peoples in the Battle of the Morannon by stooping down on the Nazgûl who flew on winged beasts. After the destruction of The One Ring Gwaihir, Landroval and Meneldor flew into Mordor to search for Frodo and Sam and carried Frodo and Sam out of Mordor to safety.

## Genealogy

## Etymology
***Gwaihir*** is a Sindarin name, which probably means "Windlord", because he is often referred to as "Gwaihir the Windlord". The first element of the name is *gwae(w)* ("wind").

## Other versions of the legendarium
Eagles named "Gwaihir" and "Landroval" (or, in even earlier texts, "Gwaewar" and "Lhandroval") appeared in an early version of *The Silmarillion*, as vassals of Thorondor who helped to bear Beren and Lúthien from Angband.

In the whole *Lord of the Rings* Gwaihir carries Gandalf twice, and by the end of the book Gandalf says that Gwaihir had carried him twice. This can be interpreted to imply that Gwaihir never carried him before, but it is also possible that Gandalf only referred to the number of times that Gwaihir carried him in the recent past in the events that took place in *The Lord of the Rings*.

Robert Foster implies that Gwaihir is the Lord of the Eagles of *The Hobbit* although Tolkien never made a connection nor mentioned that Gwaihir was the Lord of the Eagles. Douglas Anderson and Anders Stenström (Beregond) reject that Gwaihir is the Lord of Eagles of *The Hobbit*.
