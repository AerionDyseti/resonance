# Estë

**Estë** (Quenya; IPA: ) was an Ainu and the Vala responsible for the healing of the hurt and weary.

## Biography
Estë lived with her husband Irmo in Lórien. She did not walk by day; instead, she slept upon an island of the tree-shadowed Lake of Lórellin. All those who dwelt in Valinor drew refreshment from the fountains of Estë and Irmo in Lórien. In like manner, the Valar themselves often came to the fountains and would find easing and reposing there from the burdens of Arda.

Melian had formerly served both Estë and Vána. She dwelt long in Lórien, tending to the trees that flowered in the Gardens of Lórien, before departing for Middle-earth.

When the Elves dwelt in Valinor, Finwë, the King of the Ñoldor, was grieved that his first wife Míriel no longer had strength to carry on. Afterwards, Manwë surrendered the care of Míriel to Irmo. Estë and her maidens still tended Míriel's body, and it remained unwithered though she never returned to the living.

It was said that Estë did not attend the Councils of the Valar. Thus, she was not reckoned among the Valier and was counted instead as the Chief of the Maiar.

She was dressed in grey.

## Etymology
***Estë*** is a Quenya word that meant 'rest'.).
