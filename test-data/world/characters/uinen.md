# Uinen

**Uinen** (Sindarin; IPA: ) was a Maia spirit known as ***The Lady of the Sea*** and the wife of the Maia Ossë. She was a matron to all mariners. Uinen was third greatest of all the Maiar.

## Biography
### Before the Sun and the Moon
Uinen loved all creatures that lived in the saltwater streams of the world and the weeds that grew in them. Her love calmed the violent tidal waves and storms created by Ossë her husband by keeping him in line and not going too far. Her hair spread throughout waters and lies on their surfaces. During the early days Arda, Ossë rebelled against his Lord Ulmo (*Lord of All Waters*) and served Melkor instead, being carried away by the false promises that Melkor gave to him. For a while, there rose great tumults in the sea that wrought great ruins to the lands. Because of this, and because of the prayers of Aulë who created those lands, Uinen helped bring Ossë back to the allegiance of their lord Ulmo by restraining her husband and bringing him before Ulmo. Following that, Ossë was pardoned and gave his allegiance back to the Valar. To the Maiar Uinen and Ossë, Ulmo gave them the task of the governing of the waves and the movements of the Inner Seas. Ever afterwards, Uinen was the one who restrained Ossë's bouts of violence in the seas and on the coasts.

Eventually, when the Teleri remained on the coast of the western seas, awaiting Ulmo to take them to Aman, Uinen and Ossë came among the Teleri and befriended them. After the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, where Fëanor and his host of exiled Ñoldor attacked the Teleri and stole their ships, Uinen wept for the Telerin mariners who had been wickedly slain and tossed into the sea. The sea also rose in great wrath against the Ñoldorin slayers, so that many of the stolen Telerin ships were wrecked and the Ñoldor in them were drowned.

When the Hiding of Valinor took place, Ossë raised the enchanted Isles. Then next, Uinen enchanted those who ever managed to reach the Isles by weaving them in her hair before Irmo (*Master of Dreams & Desires*) put them to age-long sleep.

### Second Age
In the Second Age, the mariners of Númenór would cry to Uinen for help, because she was the only one capable of calming Ossë who loved to create tumults in the seas. And the Númenóreans lived under her protection while their respect for the Valar endured. Therefore, the Númenóreans held the Maia Uinen in reverence as equal to the Valar.
