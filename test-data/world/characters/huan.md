# Huan

**Huan**, the **Hound of Valinor**, was a great Wolfhound of the First Age. He was given by the Vala Oromë the Hunter to his friend Celegorm, one of the Sons of Fëanor. Huan was as large as a small horse, and accompanied Celegorm on his huntings. When the Ñoldor under Fëanor rebelled, Huan went with his master to Middle-earth.

Huan had been granted special powers by the Valar, and was allowed to speak three times before he died. It was also prophesied that he could not be killed unless it was by the greatest wolf that ever lived.

## Biography
left|thumb|261x261px|Huan with Celegorm, by :Category:Art by Mathia Arkoniel|Mathia Arkoniel
Huan was originally a Hound of Oromë in Valinor and was eventually given to Celegorm, Fëanor's third son. He went into exile with his master during the Flight of the Ñoldor. He might have stayed with his master in Himlad and later fled with him to Nargothrond after their defeat in the Dagor Bragollach.

He became involved with the Quest for the Silmaril. When Beren had left Lúthien and gone with Finrod Felagund to Angband but had been captured in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, Lúthien set out to rescue him. She was intercepted by Celegorm and Curufin, who were living in Nargothrond at the time and were hunting. Huan smelt Lúthien and captured her, and she was brought before Celegorm. Celegorm and Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death by the hand of Sauron, and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, "for her own protection", secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father Thingol. and then accompanied her to Tol-in-Gaurhoth where, with the help of Lúthien's magic, he killed all of Sauron's werewolves until Sauron himself came out; knowing of the prophecy about Huan's death, he took the shape of the greatest wolf that had ever lived up to that point. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat him, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while Lúthien and Beren went on their way back to Doriath; they came across Celegorm and Curufin once more, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by Orodreth when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien, but Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien. deriving from the Sindarin *hû* ("hound").

In Quenya, Huan also means "hound", from the word *khugan* or *hunen*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In earlier texts, Huan was described as "Captain of Dogs", and a rival to Tevildo (later Sauron), Prince of Cats. Huan met Tinuviel (Lúthien), who was initially afraid and fled from him. With his speed, Huan overtook her in two leaps and spoke "soft and deep the tongue of the Lost Elves".

There is mention in  of Huan being a possible Maia, along with Sorontar (Thorondor).

## Inspiration
Although his appearance is never described, he may have been seen as one of the Wolfhounds of Irish tradition (i.e. an Irish Wolfhound). There is also a certain allegory in The Quest of the Silmaril to *The Divine Comedy: The Inferno* by Dante Alighieri, as Dante's path to Heaven is blocked by a wolf. This Wolf will only be challenged by a Grayhound, who will drag it back to Hell. However, in illustrations, he resembles an ordinary dog/wolf mix.
