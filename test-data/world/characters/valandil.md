# Valandil

**Valandil** was the third High King of Arnor.

Valandil was the youngest of Isildur's four sons, he was only a child at the time of the War of the Last Alliance, in which his grandfather, Elendil, was killed. Due to this, he remained in Rivendell when his father and brothers went into the south, and was thus the only one of Isildur's sons to survive the Disaster of the Gladden Fields. He received the Shards of Narsil as an heirloom of the Heirs of Isildur when he came of age. Because the Elendilmir had been lost with his father, the Elven smiths of Rivendell created a copy for Valandil, which came to be known itself as the Elendilmir.

Although Valandil was by right High King of Arnor and Gondor, Valandil never made an attempt to assert suzerainty over his cousin Meneldil in Gondor and thus the two realms were sundered. Valandil continued to use the title High King of Arnor, possibly to assert his rights as head of the House of Elendil.

Valandil took up the Sceptre of Annúminas in TA 10 and ruled Arnor for two-hundred and thirty-nine years, which was longer than any King in the north or south, and he lived for two-hundred and sixty years dying in TA 249.

He was succeeded by his son Eldacar.

## Etymology
