# Soronto

**Soronto** was a Númenorean nobleman of the royal lineage of Númenor or House of Elros, the grandson of Tar-Meneldur and son of Ailinel, sister of Tar-Aldarion. He lived in the later years of the first millennium of the Second Age. His father was Orchaldor, a descendant of the House of Hador.

## Biography
Before the change in Númenor's law that turned the order of succession into cognatic primogeniture, Soronto may have been presumptive heir to the throne. (J.R.R. Tolkien intended to write a story about Tar-Aldarion's daughter Tar-Ancalimë and her cousin Soronto, and how she married only to prevent Soronto from inheriting the throne.)

## Etymology
The name ***Soronto*** apparently means "Eagle", "Eagle-friend", or perhaps "Man of the Eagle" in Quenya, from *soron* ("eagle").
