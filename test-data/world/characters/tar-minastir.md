# Tar-Minastir

**Tar-Minastir** was the eleventh King of Númenor. He was king during the War of the Elves and Sauron in the mid-Second Age, he helped defeat Sauron by sending a relief force to the aid of Gil-galad who was under siege in Middle-earth.

## Biography

Tar-Minastir was the son of Isilmo and succeeded his aunt, Queen Tar-Telperiën, when she died. He was the grandson of King Tar-Súrion. His heart yearned for the west as did many in his time and loved the Elves but envied them. At some point during his rule, he had a great tower built on Oromet so that he could gaze upon the west and dream.

During his rule, Sauron invaded Eriador from Calenardhon in SA 1695 and the realm of Eregion fell. Sauron advanced to Lindon and Rivendell. In SA 1700, Tar-Minastir sent a naval force under the command of Ciryatur to save Lindon. Ciryatur's forces drove Sauron's army back from the Grey Havens and then pursued him to Tharbad, where further Númenórean forces helped defeat Sauron at the Battle of the Gwathló. Battered but not utterly defeated Sauron retreated back to Mordor in SA 1701 swearing revenge.

From Tar-Minastir's reign, the Númenóreans began establishing permanent settlements in Middle-earth.

He abdicated the throne in SA 1869, possibly not entirely willingly, dying peacefully four years later. He was succeeded by his son, Tar-Ciryatan. He reigned for 138 years.

## Etymology

The name ***Minastir*** name means "Tower-watcher" in Quenya, which could be translated as "The Vigilant".

## Behind the Scenes

There is a significant discrepancy in Tolkien's writings regarding Tar-Minastir. Tolkien wrote that his reign started in SA 1731, yet he is also clear that it was Minastir that sent the fleet to the aid of the Elves in SA 1700. Either the date of Tar-Telperiën's abdication or the date of the Númenórean intervention is therefore an error.
