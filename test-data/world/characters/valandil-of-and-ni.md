# Valandil of Andúnië

**Valandil** founded the line of the Lords of Andúnië in the western region of Andustar on Númenor.

## Biography

Valandil's father was Elatan of Andúnië, and his mother was Silmariën, eldest child of Tar-Elendil of Númenor. The laws of Númenor at that time would not allow Silmariën to rule as queen, so Valandil and subsequent Lords of Andúnië were not in line for royal succession.

By the end of the Second Age, however, Valandil's descendants would become kings in Middle-earth, beginning with Elendil, the last Lord of Andúnië and first High King of Arnor and Gondor.

Valandil was also the name of the youngest son of Isildur and the grandson of Elendil, who eventually became High King of Arnor.

## Etymology

***Valandil*** means "Devoted to the Valar", from *Vala* and *-ndil* ("friend, devoted to"), in Quenya.
