# Ibûn

**Ibûn** was a Petty-dwarf and was the son of Mîm and brother of Khîm.

## Biography

He was captured with his father and brother by Túrin's outlaw band in the First Age. During the Sack of Amon Rûdh, he was missing in action. He might have been killed by an Orc or might have died of an accident, like his brother. But, after the destruction of Amon Rudh, Ibûn was never seen again, and would have died, as Tolkien states that Mîm was ultimately the "last" of the Petty-dwarves.

## Background
In *The Children of Hurin* and *Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth*, Ibûn is last mentioned being held hostage by the Orcs that Mîm had aligned himself with, but he is never mentioned again.
