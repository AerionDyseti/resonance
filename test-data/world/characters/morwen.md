# Morwen

**Morwen** was an Adan of the House of Bëor, the daughter of Baragund, wife of Húrin Thalion, and mother of Túrin Turambar.

Morwen was tall, dark-haired, bright-eyed, majestic, and the most beautiful mortal woman of her time - so beautiful, in fact, that people called her **Eledhwen** ("the Elven-fair"). She was also a proud and stern woman of few words.

## Biography
Morwen was born in Ladros in the northeast of Dorthonion to Baragund and an unnamed wife. She married Húrin of the House of Marach. After the Dagor Bragollach, she and her folk moved northeast through the Ered Wethrin and after enduring great losses and finally came to Dor-lómin in Hithlum and were well received by the folk there. It was here that she and her husband had their three children, Túrin, Niënor Níniel, and Urwen.

Húrin went off to fight in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad but never returned as the battle was lost. After the defeat of the Union of Maedhros, the savage Easterlings came to Hithlum to claim their new land as a reward for fighting for the Dark Lord. The Easterlings were cruel and took many slaves including the young and old. Morwen resisted the new Easterling lords that took over Húrin's land, and sent Túrin away to Doriath and the court of King Thingol, to prevent him from being taken as a slave. However, none of the Easterlings dared take Morwen's home, for her incredible beauty led them to believe she was a magical witch and in league with Elves, although she had neither such power nor intimate connections. After most of the danger had passed, she went to Doriath looking for Túrin. Niënor followed her against her commands, but she was accepted by Thingol.

Morwen was alarmed at not finding her son in Doriath, and after staying for a while, she and Mablung left to search for Túrin. Niënor followed against Morwen's will for a second time. While they sought for Túrin in the forest, Glaurung the dragon came upon them. He gave Niënor amnesia with his dragon magic and left. When Mablung found Niënor, she ran off into the woods, and was not seen by Morwen again. Morwen returned to Doriath after this sad incident.

Their graves remained after the drowning of Beleriand at the end of the First Age on the isle of Tol Morwen off the coast of Forlindon, which was named after her.

## Etymology
The name ***Morwen*** is Sindarin for "Dark Maiden", from *mor* ("dark") and *-gwenn* or *-wen* ("maiden"). Her epithet **Eledhwen** means "Elf-maiden", from *eledh* ("elf"). Eledhwen is interpreted as "**Elfsheen**".

## In other versions
In *Turambar and the Foalókë* Morwen and her daughter Niënor are respectively called **Tirannë** and *Vainóni*. In this earlier version of the tale of  the memories of both women are wiped out by the evil magician Kurúki. At the end of the account, exhaling his last breath the dragon Glorund restores Vainóni's memories inducing her to threw herself off of a waterfall.

In another of earlier versions of Tolkien's legendarium, Morwen was known as **Mavwin.**
