# Baragund

**Baragund** was an Edain of the House of Bëor in the First Age.

## Biography
Baragund was the son of Bregolas and a direct descendant of Bëor the Old. He was the father of Morwen, and he was thus the grandfather of Túrin Turambar. He and his family lived peacefully in Dorthonion before the Dagor Bragollach. He survived the battle and lived as an outlaw with his uncle Barahir and other companions for nearly five years. They were eventually betrayed to Sauron by the unhappy Gorlim and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
