# Amrod

**Amrod** was the second-youngest of the seven sons of Fëanor, son of Finwë.

## Biography

Amrod and his younger brother, Amras, were born during the Years of the Trees in Valinor. In the rebellion of the Ñoldor, Amrod and his brothers swore the Oath of Fëanor. Before they left for Middle-earth, Nerdanel Amrod's mother begged Fëanor to leave her two youngest son with him or at least one of them. Fëanor refused her, and Nerdanel prophesied that one of them will not set foot on Middle-earth. In fact, Amrod died during the Burning of the ships at Losgar.

In accordance to , Amrod and his six brothers rescued their father during the Dagor-nuin-Giliath. He had also held the lands of Estolad with his brother. In FA 538, Amrod and Amras died during the Third Kinslaying at the Havens of Sirion.

## Etymology
Amrod's father-name was **Telufinwë**, meaning "Last Finwë", most likely from Quenya *tella* ("hindmost, last"). The short form of this name is **Telvo**. Originally, his mother-name was **Ambarussa**, "Top-russet", from *amba* ("upwards"). When Fëanor insisted on different names for the twins, Nerdanel named Amrod **Umbarto**, "the Fated". Fëanor later changed it to **Ambarto**, "Upwards-exalted", from *amba* and *arta* ("exalted, lofty"). eventually a name for someone else.

In Old English, Amrod's name is ***Deormod*** "the Brave-hearted".

## Other versions of the legendarium
In , when arriving in Middle-earth, Fëanor had roused his sons to burn the ships. Yet in the morning, Amras noticed the absence of his twin brother Amrod and asked for him. Amras explained to his father Fëanor that Amrod did not sleep on the ground in great discomfort but slept instead in one of the ships. Then in great dread, Fëanor perceived that his son Amrod had wished to sail back and rejoin his mother Nerdanel in Valinor but the ships had all been burnt now with his son in one of them. Thus sadly, Amrod perished there in Losgar when the ships had been set to fire by the command of his father. And none dared to speak to Fëanor about this matter afterward.

It was mentioned that Amrod and his twin brother Amras remained alike, but eventually Amrod, the elder of the two, grew darker in hair. It was also said that among his twin-sons, Fëanor held Amrod to be more dear to him.
