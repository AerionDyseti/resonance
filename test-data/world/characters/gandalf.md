# Gandalf

**Gandalf** was one of the five Istari sent to Middle-earth by the Valar in the Third Age. In Valinor he was known as Olórin. Gandalf was instrumental in bringing about the demise of Sauron in , chiefly by encouraging others and dispensing his wisdom at pivotal times. He was originally robed in grey, and second to Saruman in the Order of Wizards. After his fall in Moria, Gandalf returned to Middle-earth as head of the Order, robed in white. He was noteworthy for his keen interest in Hobbits.

## History
### Early history

The wisest of the Maiar, Gandalf was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur. At the beginning of Time, he was amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä. In his "youth" he was known as ***Olórin*** and lived in Lórien. Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience. He became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda.

After the Valar discovered the primeval Elves at Cuiviénen, Olórin was sent there as one of the Five Guardians to guard the Elves from the forces of Melkor. It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the Eldar on the Great Journey. But it is said he loved the Elves, and throughout his early life, he walked Unseen among them, or wore a Fana that appeared like an Elf, and he sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, taking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and lifting out of despair those who listened to him. It is possible that this was just after the year 1200, but it is said that "only those Wise could say who are now gone" could attest to the truth of this conversation.

### Third Age
#### Arrival in Middle-earth
During the Third Age, while Sauron's 'dark spirit of malice' was increasing over Middle-earth, the Valar chose the Istari, missionaries from among the Maiar, to go to Middle-earth and help the peoples. Manwë selected Olórin, who, at first, did not wish to go, as he feared Sauron. However, Manwë said that it was all the more reason why he should go. Furthermore, the One Ring, the location of much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere in Middle-earth. 

Olórin submitted to the will of Manwë and departed Valinor to Mithlond in the year .

Gandalf then began his sojourn in Middle-earth, going about as a wanderer and counsellor. Unlike Saruman, Gandalf did not take up a single permanent residence. Gandalf never went to the east and apparently restricted his activities to the Westlands of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the Dúnedain and the Eldar remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he remained in Middle-earth: Elves named him *Mithrandir*, the Grey Pilgrim, while the men of Arnor named him **Gandalf**, which became his most common name. He was also known as *Incánus* in the south, and *Tharkûn* to the Dwarves.

#### Early vigilance
Around ,

Over the next two hundred years the evil continued to grow, as well as the source directing it. Orcs were multiplying in the Misty Mountains and elsewhere. The Witch-king, the mightiest of the Nazgûl, had built a fortress in Angmar in the Northern wastelands and waged unending war against the Kingdom of Arnor. Meanwhile Moria and Minas Ithil fell under a shadow, while other wars, plagues, and catastrophes occurred across Middle-earth. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur in  to discover its secret.

In , his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy. Most importantly, Gandalf found that the Necromancer was no Nazgûl, but was Sauron himself, and he had taken the last of the Seven Rings from the Dwarf King. Sauron was gathering the remaining Rings of Power and possibly searching for his lost One Ring.

Gandalf escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the White Council. Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. Gandalf was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through the Shire on his way to the Ered Luin), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon Smaug with Thorin.

Ultimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a "burglar" of Gandalf's own choosing.  Gandalf had a feeling that a Hobbit should be involved, and he remembered Bilbo Baggins. At first he found only Holman Cotton as Bilbo had left on the occasion of the Elven new year, something that persuaded Gandalf that Bilbo was the right person for the job. In the end Gandalf convinced the reluctant Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin. 

Gandalf accompanied Thorin and Company to Rivendell. Gandalf saved them from a trio of Stone-trolls, and later obtained the legendary sword Glamdring from their Troll-hoard; Gandalf bore it thenceforth. He also helped Thorin and Company through the Misty Mountains. When they unknowingly camped in the Front Porch of the Goblin-town, the Goblins captured the whole company except Gandalf, who surprised them much later by killing the Great Goblin and then rescuing the Dwarves and leading them to the exit. It was during this time that Bilbo obtained a "magic ring". The hobbit initially claimed he "won" it from the creature "Gollum" while the company was under the Misty Mountains, and he kept it secret from Gandalf for some time. 

On their escape out, the Company was saved by the Eagles of the Misty Mountains; Gandalf once had healed the Great Eagle from a poisoned wound, The White Council had met under the gravest of circumstances: Sauron's vast power was returning, even without his Ring. Gandalf at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Saruman agreed (as by now he feared Sauron as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Ring). Gandalf joined his peers in assailing Dol Guldur, ridding Mirkwood of the Necromancer's presence, who fled to Mordor. When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Thorin's Company in Mirkwood reached him, and he realised that the instructions he gave them did not help; they had lost their way, and then vanished from the imprisonment of the Wood-elves, who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.

Meanwhile Thorin's quest was successful: Erebor was retaken and Smaug was killed, but when Gandalf finally arrived to the area, he found the Dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills preparing for an attack by the Lake-men and the Elves of Mirkwood. He was with Bard and Thranduil and revealed his presence trying to reason with Thorin. When the attack was beginning, Gandalf halted them, to warn that the Orcs and Wargs were coming to claim the treasure. He invited Dáin Ironfoot for council, and soon Dwarves, Elves and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the Orcs of the Misty Mountains in the Battle of Five Armies. 

King Thorin was mortally wounded and after his funeral and the reestablishment of Erebor under Dáin, Bilbo and Gandalf left Erebor for the Shire; on the way, they celebrated Yule at Beorn's, and then returned to Rivendell, where Gandalf discussed with Elrond the events of Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Smaug, who could have been used to disastrous effect by Sauron. A large number of Orcs and Wargs also were killed in the North, removing threats to Rivendell and Lothlórien.

As Gandalf and Bilbo passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-trolls, they recovered the gold of the troll-hoard they had buried.

During this period Gandalf visited the Shire frequently, especially his friend Bilbo Baggins, and his younger cousin, Frodo Baggins. He noted Bilbo's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious "magic ring" that Bilbo had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Gandalf recalled the deceit Bilbo used in originally claiming it for his own — Bilbo had later admitted to stealing it from Gollum. Gandalf could see that Bilbo was very preoccupied with the ring. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions. In  he organised Bilbo's Farewell Party, and before leaving the Shire, he convinced Bilbo to leave the Ring for Frodo. He then emphatically warned Frodo not to use it; Gandalf had begun to suspect that the "magic ring" was indeed a Ring of Power. Around that time, Gandalf became unpopular in the Shire; he was blamed for Bilbo's disappearance, and was even accused of plotting with Frodo to get a hold on Bilbo's wealth.

#### War of the Ring

Gandalf returned to the Shire on 12 April  and proved to Frodo that Bilbo's ring was the ancient One Ring which the Dark Power of Mordor was looking for. He told Frodo that he gathered much of this information by interrogating the creature Gollum. Frodo exclaimed that Gollum should have been killed, however Gandalf speculated that perhaps Gollum would have a part to play before the end, and in any case, it was not for Frodo to decide who should live and who should die. during which time, on 1 May he went to Sarn Ford and met again Aragorn, informing him of Frodo's plans. He had a sense of foreboding and heard disturbing news about war in Gondor and a Black Shadow. These phenomena were seen by Aragorn and the hobbits from afar, although they were unaware that Gandalf was involved. Before leaving Weathertop, he marked some stones with the certh G for them to find. The next day he escaped to the north, followed by four Riders. When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm, he decided to take the Fellowship through the ruins of Moria, where the remains of the great Dwarven city of Khazad-dûm were now a labyrinth of tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loath to enter the maze, as it was now the lair of orcs and something known only as "Durin's Bane".

At the Doors of Durin on the west side of the mountains, Gandalf, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Moria on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the Chamber of Mazarbul, where Gandalf read the Book of Records, which revealed the fate of Balin, the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Moria. Soon after, the party was attacked by orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then, Gandalf was well aware of their location and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.

However, Durin's Bane caught up to the group at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm. Gandalf and Legolas immediately realised what it was: a Balrog of Morgoth. Gandalf faced the demon and broke the bridge upon which they both stood, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm.  But the Balrog's whip lashed out, and grasped Gandalf by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Gandalf shouted "Fly, you fools" and vanished into the abyss.

Yet Gandalf did not die; he and the Balrog fought long in the bowels and deep places of Arda. After restless pursuit over the course of eight days, Gandalf and the beast finally came to the summit of the Endless Stair upon the peak of Celebdil. There, he fought the demon for two days and nights. The Balrog had burst into flame anew when it exited the stairs; ice, wind, and smoke swirled about them as they duelled. Gandalf used his last measure of strength to slay the Balrog, throwing him down the mountainside in ruin. Gandalf's spirit then left his body, having sacrificed himself to save the Fellowship.

##### Gandalf the White
But Gandalf's spirit did not depart Middle-earth forever. As the only one of the five Istari to stay true to his errand, Olórin was sent back to mortal lands by Eru, and he became Gandalf once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth, he was granted the power to "reveal" more of his inner Maiar strength. This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in Middle-earth, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succour those who opposed Sauron. Nevertheless, when Gandalf's wrath was kindled his "unveiled" strength was such that few of Sauron's servants could withstand him.

As he lay on the mountaintop, the great eagle Gwaihir came up and bore him to Lothlórien, where he was clothed and replenished, and given a new staff by Galadriel. Gandalf soon learned that Frodo had left the Fellowship and was travelling to Mount Doom. As Frodo was beyond his assistance now, Gandalf promptly went south to Fangorn Forest, where he met the Three Hunters: Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli, and gave them messages from Galadriel. From them, he learned that Sam went with Frodo, and he was pleased with this.

The city was soon besieged by a vast force from Mordor, led by the Witch-king. An ill-advised counterattack resulted in Faramir receiving a wound from a poisoned dart; he lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Gandalf encouraged the men of Minas Tirith to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Ringwraiths by his very presence.  But Sauron's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Denethor then lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death. He abandoned his leadership of the city, and Gandalf then took it upon himself to direct the defence of the city. When the gigantic battering ram Grond destroyed the ancient entrance to the city, Gandalf placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Witch-king then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Gandalf with death; but Gandalf did not move — seated upon Shadowfax he defied the mightiest of Sauron's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Rohirrim. Hearing the horns of the Riders of Rohan, the Witch-king departed.

However, Gandalf did not pursue his foe, for Pippin brought him news that Denethor was about to burn himself and his son Faramir to death on a pyre like the heathen kings of old. Gandalf rushed to stop this, and was able to save Faramir, but not Denethor, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Gandalf then learned how it was that Denethor's will had been broken: the Steward clutched a palantír in his hands as he burned.

Nevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. Éowyn of Rohan and Merry defeated the Witch-king, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Aragorn arrived with a large host of men from the southern fiefs upon a captured pirate fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Sauron's attack against Minas Tirith, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Gandalf's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the Elder Days, had defeated Sauron's first move.

##### Last battle
But the attack against Minas Tirith was only a part of Sauron's plan to devastate the West and make himself the ruler of Middle-earth. Other armies moved in the north against Erebor and the Kingdom of Thranduil, as well as against Lothlórien and other points along the Anduin. Still commanding vast armies of orcs and men, the Dark Lord soon would move against Gondor again; the remnants of the Edain and their allies had little hope against his almost limitless resources. 

In Minas Tirith, Gandalf was selected by Aragorn, Imrahil, and Éomer (the remaining lords of the west) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Gandalf's efforts in Middle-earth. Fully aware that the West would stand or fall on the outcome of Frodo's mission, he advised the lords to drive north to the Morannon, thereby drawing Sauron's eye away from Frodo's likely location. This plan would likely result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Frodo a chance to achieve the quest of Mount Doom.

Led by Gandalf and Aragorn, the army of the West crossed the Anduin and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming, and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Black Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul Mouth of Sauron rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Frodo's Mithril-coat and Barrow-blade and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Sauron then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Gandalf however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Sauron's offer. In shock, the Mouth of Sauron turned back towards the Black Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of orcs and trolls advancing on the lords of the west. Sauron's trap was sprung.

Yet Sauron himself became the victim of Gandalf's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Frodo and Sam had succeeded in scaling Mount Doom. Even as the Battle of Morannon began, Frodo stood at the Crack of Doom. But the power and lure of the Ring finally overcame his will and he placed the ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Nazgûl were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realised his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his Ring.

But Gandalf's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Gollum, who had been doggedly following the Ring-bearer, seized the Ring from Frodo, and, while celebrating his reunion with "his precious," unwittingly fell into the fires of Orodruin. The ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of Barad-dûr and the Towers of the Teeth began to collapse, their foundations crumbling. The Ring-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Sauron was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again.

With Sauron gone, his forces scattered; the Men of the West now set upon them with fury. Gandalf announced the success of the Ring-bearer and the end of Sauron; the quest had been fulfilled.  Seeing that victory was achieved, Gandalf then mounted Gwaihir the Eagle for the third time, and set out for Mount Doom in search of Frodo and Sam. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Orodruin, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions. The great quest was over.

#### End of the Order
In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and the remaining members of the Fellowship reunited. At the coronation of King Elessar, Gandalf, at Aragorn's request, set the crown upon the King’s head, and declared "*Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the Valar endure!*". Thus Gandalf ushered in the new age of men.

After the coronation and wedding of Aragorn to Arwen, Gandalf left with the rest of the remaining Fellowship on the journey home. For Gandalf, it was his last long journey in Middle-earth. His errand to Arda had been fulfilled; Sauron had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Hobbits remained at his side. At the borders of the Shire he, too, turned away. He left the Hobbits to settle the affairs of the Shire themselves, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to Tom Bombadil.

What Gandalf did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his "*long talk*" with Bombadil was just that. At any rate, on 29 September , he met Frodo at Mithlond, ready to take the White Ship over the sea to Aman.  He wore Narya openly on his finger, and Shadowfax was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to Samwise, Merry, and Pippin (the later two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, and Galadriel. The ship passed west upon the sea, and then took the hidden straight path to Valinor. Gandalf became Olórin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of Irmo. Olórin, the wisest of the Maiar and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the free peoples of Middle-earth to overcome the evil of their time. 

## Characteristics
### Personality
left|thumb|The Grey Pilgrim relaxing. Art by Roger Garland
Gandalf is often described in *The Lord of the Rings* as quick to anger, and equally quick to laugh. He had great pity and patience, even extending to the servants of his enemies. He is said to have learned both from Nienna in Valinor. He was alternately affectionate and brusque; he often surprised others with his bluntness when time was of the essence. Gandalf consistently upbraided foolish behaviour, but also richly rewarded those who acted with good intentions.

Hobbits appealed to him more than to the other Wizards, and he often went to the Shire for respites from his errands. It may be that he was amused by their nature. It may also be because they were untouched by the great evils of the world, and were more in touch with nature than Men; perhaps their agrarian lifestyle appealed to Gandalf's innate spirit and reminded him of the gardens of Valinor.

Círdan the Shipwright divined in him "the greatest spirit and the wisest" out of all of the Wizards that came from the West, and so he entrusted the care of Narya, one of the Three Rings of the Elves, to Gandalf rather than to Saruman. He also prevented Sauron's Eye from locating Frodo.

He frequently used his powers for entertainment. He blew glowing smoke rings that moved around the room at his direction, and was known among Hobbits for his fireworks displays,

When he arrived in Middle-earth, Gandalf received the Elven ring Narya from Círdan.

The Men of the North called him so because they incorrectly thought that he was of Elven-kind and because they knew his alliance and friendship with Elves well.

Gandalf is also the name of a dwarf in the Völuspá, one of the poems of the Poetic Edda, from where Tolkien got many of the Dwarven names used in his books.

## Other names

***Greyhame**: Used in Rohan, it was the equivalent in Rohanese of ""Greycloak" which would have been *grēg-hama*.

****Incánus***: Gained during his long travels "in the south" (likely meaning no further south than Gondor or the Near Harad
**A possible Westron invention meaning "Greymantle". It is a modernized form of Old English *lad-spell* ("a painful grievous story") from *lad* ("causing hate, evil, injury") and *spell* ("story", "message"). In earlier drafts, it is actually Théoden who refers to Gandalf as Láthspell.

****Mithrandir***: His Sindarin name (), used in Gondor and meaning "Grey Pilgrim" or "Grey Wanderer", from *mith* ("grey") + *randir* ("pilgrim, wandering man").

****Olórin***: His original name in Valinor. It is Quenya, and its meaning is associated with the Quenya word  *olos* or *olor*, meaning "dream" or "vision / of mind". In a draft manuscript of *The Lord of the Rings*, occurs the spelling *Olórion*.

***Stormcrow**: The name given to Gandalf by King Théoden in Rohan, a reference to his arrival being associated with times of trouble. or "Staff-man". In a draft manuscript of *The Lord of the Rings*, occurs the spelling *Sharkûn*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In early manuscripts of *The Hobbit*, the name *Bladorthin* was used by Tolkien for the character who later would be named *Gandalf*. The name *Gandalf* was instead used for the character known as Thorin in the published works.

## Inspiration

left|thumb|*Der Berggeist* by [[Josef Madlener]]

- Gandalfr*
appears in the list of dwarves in the *Völuspá* of the Elder Edda, the name means "Cane-elf". Tolkien took the name along with the other dwarves' names when he wrote *The Hobbit* in the 1930s. He came to regret the creation of this "rabble of eddaic-named dwarves [...] invented in an idle hour", since it forced him to come up with an explanation of why Old Norse names should be used in Third Age Middle-earth. He solved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that Old Norse was a *translation* of the language of Dale. The figure of Gandalf has other influences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation as "the Wanderer", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff: Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an *"Odinic wanderer"* in a letter of 1946.

Tolkien had a postcard labelled *Der Berggeist* ("the mountain spirit"), and on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote "the origin of Gandalf" at some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure, sitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a wide-brimmed round hat and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling his upturned hands.
Humphrey Carpenter in his 1977 biography said that Tolkien had bought the postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred Zimmerman discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef Madlener and dates to the late 1920s. Carpenter concluded that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself. Tolkien must have acquired the card at some time in the early 1930s, at a time when *The Hobbit* had already begun to take shape.

### Films
'*1967: *The Hobbit* (1967 film):*'
:Gandalf's role is drastically reduced. He lives in a tower, where Thorin, the princess and the guard meet him to discuss the killing of Slag. He introduces them to Bilbo, but does not go on the quest.

'*1971: *Sagan om Ringen* (1971 film):*'
:Gandalf is present at the Bilbo Baggins' 111th birthday party and dines with Frodo, Sam Merry, and Pippin. Later, Frodo recieves Bilbo's ring as a birthday present and asks Gandalf about its purpose, having previously seen Biblo disappear with it. Gandalf tells Frodo of the forging of 20 magical rings and asks whether there are any marks on Bilbo's. Gandalf throws it into the fireplace, which reveals text on the ring, confirming Gandalf's suspicion that Bilbo's ring is indeed The One Ring. He encourages Frodo to bring the ring to Rivendell and participate in the Council of Elrond. He was imprisoned by Saruman the Whute on his highest tower and was able to escape by sending a message to the birds and being rescued by the Eagle Gwahir. He flys to Rohan and is dropped off. Gandalf is given permission by the king to take a horse for himself. When looking for one, he discovers a a majestic white horse, named Shadowfax by the Men of Rohan. Gandalf notes his beauty, speed and the fact that that no man had ever rode him. Gandalf tames him and rides him to the Shire. He narrowly misses the Hobbits who are in the Old Forest. Gandalf, unable to meet with the Frodo, and his Hobbit friends who agree to accompany him, at the *Prancing Pony Inn*, writes Frodo a letter, confirming that the man known as Strider is called Aragorn and is a man to be trusted. Finally arriving at the Prancing Pony, he hears word that Frodo had set off and he spends the night. The next day, Bree is stormed by Black Riders and Gandalf pursues them on Shadowfax to Weathertop. He arrives at Rivendell 3 days before Frodo. When Frodo arrives, he is comatosed by his encounter with the Black Riders. He greets Frodo when he recovers, 4 days after the Hobbit's arrival in Rivendell. He reunites with the Hobbits at the Council in Rivendell and tells the Council members of his journey. He agrees to join the Fellowship of the Ring, which aims to bring the Ring to Mordor and destroy it. The Fellowship sets off with Gandalf leading the group.

When that road fails, the Fellowship goes back and travels through Moria. In Moria Gandalf and the other member of the Fellowship are separated. After finding Frodo, Aragorn and Gimli the fellowship is attacked by a Cave-troll and Goblins. After Gandalf defeats the Cave-troll the Fellowship has to flee for the Balrog. When they reach the Bridge of Khazad-dûm a cutscene is shown, in which Gandalf destroys the bridge and falls with the Balrog in the depths. After the fall Gandalf has to follow the footsteps of the Balrog through the depths of Moria and the Endless Stair until he reaches Durin's Tower, where he has to defeat the Balrog.

**2004: *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth*:*'
:In non-storyline skirmishes Gandalf is the hero of the Gondor faction, who possesses several magical abilities. At first, he appears as Gandalf "the Grey", and becomes "Gandalf the White" after reaching level 5 (out of 10). Gandalf also narrates the prologue scene, repeating almost word for word the lines said by Galadriel in the *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*.

:His involvement in the storyline is notable for major differences from the original tale. First of all, Gandalf survives his encounter with Balrog, defeating him at the Bridge of Khazad-dum and continues the journey with the Fellowship - by the time of arrival in Lothlorien he already appears as Gandalf the White. He is present during the ambush at Amon Hen, where thanks to his involvement Boromir is saved from certain death. Merry and Pippin are captured regardless and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir give chase, while Gandalf departs them to see to dealings in Rohan, including freeing of King Théoden from the spell. Following the Battle of Helm's Deep he travels to Minas Tirith along with both Pippin and Boromir, where they participate in the Siege of the city.

**2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Gandalf is a non-playable character voiced by Harry Chase, who narrates cutscenes and instances throughout the original game, before the first expansion. He first meets the Dwarven characters in Ered Luin in , shortly before the Quest for Erebor. Later, characters of all races meet him in Bree in October of , but he is too busy with concerns for Frodo and the Ring and merely sends them away to find Radagast. Finally, the players have a chance to have a proper conversation with him in Rivendell, following the Council of Elrond. During that time, Gandalf is involved in several quests, including helping the player wreck havoc among the Goblins stirring at the High Pass. After the Fellowship leaves Rivendell, players are able to retrace many of their steps, including the marks left by Gandalf such as the Burnt Top in Eregion and the remains of his fire at the pass of Caradhras. Later, Lady Galadriel bids the player to find the signs of Gandalf following his fall from the Bridge of Khazad-dum - said signs include his burnt hat at the Foundations of Stone in Moria and the signs of his struggle with the Balrog at the Endless Stair - those allow Galadriel to discern that Mithrandir is not truly dead. Players later meet him as Gandalf the White in Caras Galadhon shortly after the Fellowship has departed Lothlorien. During that time, he engages into a spiritual battle with a Gaunt-Lord Gortheron the Doom-Caller; his display of his new abilities encourages the band of Free People players and allows them to defeat the servant of Sauron.

:Gandalf is also present in several historic "session plays", during which players witness the important events their characters were not present for. Such events include Gandalf infiltrating Dol Guldur with the help of an Elf named Raddir, first meeting between Gandalf and Aragorn on the outskirts of Lothlorien and Gandalf's imprisonment atop Orthanc by Saruman.

In the good campaign he appears at the end of the Isengard mission, where he has to kill Saruman in Orthanc. In Moria he can be played to destroy the Balrog and in Minas Tirith he has to defend the gates of the second ring. He is also one of the four playable heroes in the last mission, the battle of the Black Gate. He appears as well at the end of the last mission, the Shire, of the evil campaign, in which he is defeated by Sauron.
:He is also playable in the Shire, Isengard, Minas Tirith and Moria with the *Conquest* Mode, in Isengard and Minas Tirith in the *Team Deathmatch* mode, the citadel of Minas Tirith in *Capture the Ring* mode, and at the Black Gate, Minas Morgul, Mount Doom and the Shire during *Hero Team Deathmatch* mode.

'*2011: *The Lord of the Rings: War in the North*:**
:Gandalf is voiced by Tom Kane, who also narrates the introduction of the game. He tells that heroes like "Aragorn the King", "Frodo the Ringbearer" and "**Gandalf the Wizard*'" are rightly honoured, but that without a few heroes - Eradan, Andriel and Farin - the north of Middle-earth would have been lost.
:He also appears in Rivendell later in the game. Players can interact with him and learn of various important events, yet the conversations do not unlock any side-quests and do not affect the main story in any way.

'*2012: *Guardians of Middle-earth*:*'
