# Dúnhere

**Dúnhere** was the chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale, and a valiant captain who fought in the First Battle of the Fords of Isen and the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

## History
Dúnhere was a nephew of Erkenbrand. He was the chieftain of the folk of Harrowdale and the lord of Harrowdale.

He served under Grimbold in the Battles of the Fords of Isen. Grimbold placed all the riders for whom horses were available under the command of Dúnhere to cover the retreat of his forces to the south in the night after the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen.

Dúnhere did not accompany Gandalf and Erkenbrand to the Battle of the Hornburg, but went to Edoras instead. Gandalf counselled him and the other captains to assemble the riders of Rohan in Harrowdale and to await King Théoden there, rather than in the open fields around Edoras, and to light as few fires as possible. Several days later, Théoden and the rest of the riders mustered there for the ride to Minas Tirith.

## Etymology
The name *Dúnhere* means "hill warrior" in Old English, consisting of *dūn* ("hill") + *here* ("army, host").

:Dúnhere is the Lord of Dunharrow and a nearby small village of Underharrow. He left his wife Ellen Fremedon in charge before departing with Erkenbrand for the Fords. The player sees Dúnhere shortly before the battle of Helm's Deep but not does get a chance to interact with him. They do not meet properly until the Druadan Forest on the day before the Rohirrim army arrives to Minas Tirith. Dúnhere is slain by an arrow during the battle of the Pelennor Fields.
