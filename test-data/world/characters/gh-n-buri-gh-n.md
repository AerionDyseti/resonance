# Ghân-buri-Ghân

**Ghân-buri-Ghân** was the great headman of the Drúedain who inhabited Drúadan Forest in the late Third Age. with whom he shared his name, and became the great headman of his people. The great headman of the Woses revealed the existence of the Gondrant, an old route running through the Stonewain Valley from the quarries beneath Min-Rimmon to Minas Anor. During the next day, Ghân-buri-Ghân guided the Rohirrim along the road to avoid the Orcs blocking the main road so they could reach Minas Tirith. This allowed the Rohirrim to arrive in time to fight the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. In return, Théoden promised that the people of Rohan would no longer trouble the Drúedain and would drive away the *Gorgûn* that hunted them.

## Etymology
- Ghân-buri-Ghân* means "Ghân son of Ghân" in the language of the Drúedain. It is a compound of the name *Ghân*, the element *buri* ("son of") and the name *Ghân*. In this draft, some of his physical appearance is omitted.

In an early draft of the chapter "The Steward and the King", Ghân-buri-Ghân visits Minas Tirith with two headmen "clad in garments of green leaves" where they bow before King Elesser, who grants "them the Forest of Druadan". While writing an early draft of the chapter "Many Partings", Tolkien decided to move Aragorn's interaction with Ghân-buri-Ghân from the previous chapter. In the draft, Ghân-buri-Ghân "stood by the eaves of the trees, and did them homage as they passed".
