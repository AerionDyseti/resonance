# Beregond (Captain)

**Beregond**, son of Baranor, was the first Captain of the White Company, the guard of Faramir, Prince of Ithilien, and previously, a Guard of the Citadel in Minas Tirith. He is best known for rescuing Faramir from the madness of Denethor during the Siege of Gondor.

He had two sons, Bergil and Borlas, with an unnamed wife.

## Biography
At some point in his life, Beregond became a Guard of the Citadel, serving in the Third Company. He never left Minas Tirith during his service in the guard before the War of the Ring. He was also a great admirer of Faramir, son of Denethor II, and perhaps one of his friends as well.

When Peregrin Took came to the city in March 3019, Beregond and his son Bergil served as his guides in Minas Tirith.

During the Siege of Gondor, Beregond received news from Pippin that Denethor intended to kill both himself and the seemingly-dead Faramir. Leaving his post, he fought the door guards of the place where Denethor had taken Faramir in order to reach him, until the arrival of Gandalf and Pippin, whereupon Faramir was saved. After protecting Faramir, he carried him to the Houses of Healing and stood guard over him until he awoke.

Beregond traveled with Aragorn's army to the Black Gate of Mordor to challenge the forces of Sauron. They served under Prince Imrahil, and during the Battle of the Black Gate Beregond was nearly killed by a Troll.

After the War of the Ring, Beregond was brought before the newly crowned King Elessar to answer for the abandonment of his post, as well as the murders of those who stood in his way as he raced to rescue Faramir. Recognizing that what he did was out of love for his lord, he did not impose the death penalty upon him; the newly-crowned king's largesse allowed for Beregond to simply be banished from Minas Tirith but this was under old Gondor law which left the punishment non and void but he was encouraged to live in Ithilien to serve Faramir, for whom he had broken the laws to rescue. He was also promoted to the rank of Captain of the White Company.

## In adaptations

### Lord of the Rings film trilogy
In the *Lord of the Rings* movie trilogy however, he is not included, and his deeds are transferred to Peregrin and Gandalf. Beregond was actually written into the screenplay for a brief scene, with the line "It is as the Lord Denethor predicted. Long has he foreseen this doom." In this scene, Ian Hughes played Beregond. During post-production, the filmmakers decided to change this character's name to Irolas, who does not appear in the film, but is identified by Bergil as being his uncle, thus, presumably, Beregond's brother.

Beregond is featured in *The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game* (based on Jackson's trilogy). He is prominent in many scenarios of the *Siege of Gondor* supplement.

### Video games
In , Beregond is first met in the seventh circle of Minas Tirith, shortly before the Siege of Gondor. He is having an argument with his brother Iorlas, who believes Beregond spends too much time with the Halfling Peregrin Took and is neglecting his own son and brother. After the tensions cool, the players assists both brothers with their duties around Merethrond and the guest houses. For his actions in killing two guards while saving Faramir's life, King Elessar banishes Beregond from residing in Minas Tirith, although he and his wife Gilithel are still permitted to attend Aragorn and Arwen's wedding. After King Elessar charges Steward Faramir with cleansing the evil of Minas Morgul and the Morgul Vale, Beregond joins the White Company and can be found in a camp outside the Dead City.
