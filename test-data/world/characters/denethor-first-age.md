# Denethor (First Age)

**Denethor** was the Nandorin Elf and son of Lenwë. He lived during the Years of the Trees and was the first and last King of the Laegeldrim of Ossiriand.

## Biography
Hearing of the power of Thingol, Denethor led many of his people over the Blue Mountains to Beleriand. They settled in Ossiriand, renaming it Lindon, in the east of Beleriand, and Denethor became their king. They called themselves *Laegeldrim*, or Green-elves. Sometime later, after his return from Aman, Morgoth loosed an army on Beleriand beginning the First Battle. The lightly armed Laegeldrim were driven back to the great hill of Amon Ereb, where Denethor was slain. The Laegeldrim became a reclusive people, seldom taking up arms, and never again naming a king.

## Etymology
The name *Denethor* comes from the Nandorin words dene ("strong, lithe") and thara ("tall, slender"), and gives the name a meaning of "Lithe and lank".
