# Elendur

**Elendur** was the eldest son and apparent heir of Isildur, who fell along with two of his brothers at the Gladden Fields at the beginning of the Third Age.

## Biography
Elendur was born in Númenor and followed his father and his grandfather Elendil in the fleet that was blown to Middle-earth after the Fall of Númenor. Elendur probably lived with his father within the Realms in Exile, likely in Minas Ithil.

He was the only son of Isildur to serve in the army of the Last Alliance, fighting in the Battle of Dagorlad and accompanying his father into Mordor during the Siege of Barad-dûr. His younger brothers were sent to man Minas Ithil, so Sauron could not escape westward by that route. As the eldest son of Isildur, Elendur was high in the confidence of his father; he alone of the sons knew the existence of the One Ring in his father's possession and counselled Isildur to turn over the One Ring to the Keepers of the Three Rings. He was slain in the disaster of the Gladden Fields with his father and younger brothers Aratan and Ciryon. He had a squire named Estelmo who survived the massacre. His brother Valandil, who was still a child, had remained in Imladris and so lived to rule Arnor.

Aragorn is stated to have resembled this son of Isildur "in body and mind", even though he was not descended directly from him. Elendur himself was noted to have borne a striking resemblance to his grandfather Elendil.

## Etymology
The name ***Elendur** *has two possible meanings: the first being "Elf servant" and the second being "star servant". It appears to be made of the Quenya words *elen* ("star") and *-ndur* ("follower, servant") or *-ndil* ("friend"). The name may have also come from *Elendil* (meaning "devoted to the stars").

## Portrayals in adaptations
In , the three elder sons of Isildur appear during an extended flashback set during the Siege of Barad-dûr in the year SA 3440. However, because the game's license does not cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Elendur uses the name "Meldaran" as his alias.
