# Fredegar Bolger

**Fredegar "Fatty" Bolger** was a Hobbit of the Shire. He was one of the close friends of Frodo who knew that he had the Ring and helped him with his mission to leave the Shire. 
## History
### Ancestry
Fatty was a descendant of Hildibrand Took ( - ), one of the many sons of the Old Took. He was the son of Odovacar Bolger and Rosamunda Took. Fatty was born in  and his family was from Budgeford in Bridgefields of the Eastfarthing. He also had a younger sister, Estella Bolger (b. ), who would eventually marry Meriadoc Brandybuck. 

Fredegar was a good friend of Frodo Baggins. In  he was a guest at Bilbo's Farewell Party. 

Frodo eventually came to his house, along with Sam and Pippin. It was there when the conspirators revealed themselves to Frodo, and expressed their will to follow him in his mission. Fatty however was a typical hobbit who had never left the Shire and was unwilling to do so, but would play his role; he stayed behind to keep up the pretence that Frodo was there, by wearing his clothes and keep the house occupied, and deal with any "inquisitive folk". 

After hearing that Frodo was pursued by the Black Riders, Fatty was given the option to flee with the others into the Old Forest, but that didn't seem any more inviting to him despite Merry's attempts to persuade him that the Riders were far more terrifying than the stories about the Old Forest. Fredegar opted to remain behind as a decoy for the Nazgûl and as a messenger for Gandalf in case he showed up.

The Ringwraiths did eventually come in the night of 30 September to Crickhollow for Frodo and the Ring. But Fatty, though frightened nearly witless, escaped to raise the alarm of Buckland, causing the Brandybucks to sound the Horn-call of Buckland. This caused the Nazgûl to flee, but they had learned that the Ring was gone.

### Resistance
During Saruman's rule of the Shire, Fatty led a group of partisans fighting against the Ruffians in the Brockenbores around the hills of Scary before eventually being captured. He was imprisoned in the Lockholes and starved, (and could no longer be called "Fatty") but was rescued after the victory of the Battle of Bywater.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In early versions of the text (cf. *The Return of the Shadow*), his name was **Hamilcar Bolger** and was rescued by Gandalf from Black Riders before reaching Rivendell, narrating to the protagonists Gandalf's adventures. His larger role was later abandoned.

His role survives as a minor anomaly in the published *The Lord of the Rings* - before the four Hobbits go into the Old Forest, they have *six* ponies prepared (Fatty was originally supposed to go with them). The number was corrected to *five* in the 50th Anniversary Edition.
