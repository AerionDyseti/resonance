# Erellont

**Erellont** was a faithful friend of Eärendil and one of three mariners that accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of Middle-earth.

## Biography

Like Eärendil's other two companions, Erellont's origins were not known; he probably lived in Arvernien in the Havens of Sirion with other exiles from the friendly realms.

When Eärendil was resolved to sail to Aman to plea for help from the Valar, Erellont (along with Aerandir and Falathar) went with him. When they reached the shores of the Blessed Realm, he and the others remained aboard while Eärendil sought the Valar. After Eärendil's embassy was complete, Eönwë, the herald of Manwë, came to him and the others and set them upon another ship. Manwë then set a great wind to blow them east back to Middle-earth.

His fate afterwards is unknown.
