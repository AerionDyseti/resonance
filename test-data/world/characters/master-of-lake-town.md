# Master of Lake-town

The **Master of Lake-town** was the title given to the leader of Lake-town during the late Third Age.

## History
According to the Master who held this title at the arrival of Thorin and Company in Lake-town in TA 2941, the masters had always been elected from among the old and wise.

During the Quest of Erebor in TA 2941, when the company of Thorin arrived in Lake-town, they were taken by the captain of the guard through the marketplace to the Great House where the current Master was feasting. Subsequently, Thorin declared the return of the King under the Mountain. This news quickly spread throughout the town and the people began to shout, sing, and rejoice. The Master doubted that there ever was a 'King under the Mountain', and doubted even more so that it was Thorin, but he had to take heed of the clamour. Therefore, he pretended to believe Thorin's story, and the Master yielded his own great chair to him. The Master figured that the Dwarves would stay without fulfilling their promises, and then he could comfortably boot them out. The Master accommodated the Dwarves and Bilbo Baggins for two weeks before they thought about departing for the Lonely Mountain. The Master was shocked that Thorin would dare to approach Smaug and he wondered whether he really was who he said he was. All the same, he was more than willing to let them go because they were expensive to keep, and their arrival had caused business to come to a standstill. Alongside his councilors, the Master "bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall".

When Smaug attacked Lake-town, the people urged the Master to tell them what needed to be done. But as the flames leaped from the dragon's jaw, the Master fled in his gilded boat. Thus it was that Bard took control of the situation and ultimately slew the dragon himself. The surviving townsfolk gathered on the western shore of the Long Lake and lamented at the loss of their home. The people then directed their anger at the Master, accusing him of selfishness and calling him "Moneybags". They demanded that Bard become their king. In response, the Master, in a demonstration of his charisma and oratorical prowess, rebutted the people and convinced them that their anger should be directed towards Thorin and Company instead of him. The Master remained quiet as the survivors set up camps along the shore and Bard assumed effective control of all the people but did so only in the Master's name. When the hosts of Esgaroth and the Elvenking set off for Erebor to demand their share in the treasure, the Master did not go. Those who stayed behind began to prepare for the oncoming winter by building huts and collecting resources; meanwhile, the Master directed the process of planning a new town. After his companions had deserted him, he starved to death in the Waste
