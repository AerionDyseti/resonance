# Damrod

**Damrod** was a ranger of Ithilien.

## History
Damrod was the companion of Mablung and a trusted guard of Faramir. Together he and Mablung watched Frodo and Sam during the ambush of the Men of Harad in Ithilien. While they waited before the battle Damrod told the hobbits of the Enemy's dealings with the Southrons. Damrod had little hope; he believed "the days of Gondor are numbered, and the walls of Minas Tirith are doomed".

:Mablung and Damrod are first met in Osgiliath culverts, hiding from the enemy forces above. After the the Battle of the Pelennor Fields they are finally able to come out and join the Host of the West on the march towards the Black Gate. Upon entering the Wastes of Morannon, Damrod is chosen to lead the faint-hearted soldiers relieved by Aragorn, now commanded by Duinhir, towards Cair Andros through Ithilien. After King Elessar charges Steward Faramir with cleansing the evil of Minas Morgul and the Morgul Vale, Damrod joins other Rangers in a camp outside the dead city. He later leads a group of Rangers inside Minas Morgul itself, using the confusion among enemy forces to sneak between the guard towers beneath the enemy's notice.
