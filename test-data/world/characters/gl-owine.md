# Gléowine

**Gléowine** was a minstrel of the King's House of Rohan in the late Third Age.

## History
Gléowine composed an immortalising song about Théoden and his ancestors after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. It was said that he never composed another song afterwards. Sadly, only the last stanza survived: 

Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.
Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.

:Gléowine is first encountered being banished from Edoras at the command of Gríma Wormtongue. The player and Horn later find him drinking his sorrows in the town of Snowbourn. Gléowine agrees to accompany the player, and they find that the land has been ravaged by the devilry of Saruman. They return after Théoden had been healed by Gandalf and the King takes Gléowine at his side on the ride to the Fords of Isen. During the Battle of Helm's Deep, Gléowine keeps away from the fighting and later composes a song about the last stand of Théoden's door-warden Háma. Gléowine again journeys by the King's side to Mundburg and sees the King's death at the hands of the Witch-king first-hand.
