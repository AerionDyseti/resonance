# Lenwë

**Lenwë** was a Telerin Elf, founder of the Nandor and the father of Denethor.

## Biography

In the Great Journey to Valinor, Lenwë followed Olwë with the host of the Teleri until they reached the Anduin, where he forsook the westward march. Afterwards, he and his followers broke away and went downstream, never crossing the Misty Mountains. He founded the Nandor, which his son Denethor later led, and dwelt along the Vales of Anduin. He disappeared somewhere along the Vales of Anduin or possibly in Eriador. 

Nothing more of his life, including his ultimate fate, is known.

Lenwë's descendants, hearing of Thingol's great realm, crossed into Beleriand under the leadership of his son Denethor, becoming the Laegeldrim or Green-elves, who from then onward dwelt in Ossiriand.

## Etymology

The name ***Lenwë*** is the Quenya form of the Sindarin *Denweg* ("leaving" or "departure").
