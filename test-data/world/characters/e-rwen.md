# Eärwen

**Eärwen** was the daughter of Olwë and had several unnamed brothers. She was the wife of Finarfin, and mother of Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel.

## Biography
Eärwen was born in the Years of the Trees either in Middle-earth or in the Elven realms of the Far West, possibly Tol Eressëa or Alqualondë. In YT 1280, she wedded Finarfin, the youngest son of King Finwë. Her children were Finrod, Angrod, Aegnor, and Galadriel. She was said to be a friend of Anairë, wife of Fingolfin.

Like Anairë, Eärwen did not follow her husband into exile during the Revolt of the Ñoldor.

## Etymology
The name ***Eärwen*** means "Sea-maiden" from the Quenya *ëar* ("Sea") and *-wen* ("maiden"). Her name should be pronounced as *ay-ar-wen.*

## Other versions of the legendarium
In , Eärwen has another son called Orodreth. This is later changed by Christopher Tolkien, making Orodreth a son of Angrod and Eärwen's grandson instead.
