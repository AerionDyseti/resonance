# Elwing

**Elwing** also known as **Elwing the White**, was the Half-elven daughter of Dior the Fair and his wife Nimloth. She was the younger sister of the twin brothers Eluréd and Elurín. She became the wife of another Half-elf, Eärendil the Mariner, and was the mother of Elrond and Elros.

## Biography
Elwing, as well as her brothers, were born in a house near Lanthir Lamath and lived there until her father went to Doriath to assume his inheritance as its king.

When the Sons of Fëanor attacked Doriath, all of her immediate family was either killed or lost, but those loyal to her family took Elwing as well as the Silmaril they sought and bore her away to the Havens of Sirion.

She flew continuously until she found her husband's sailing ship, the Vingilot. Then, on behalf of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth, they chose to sail for Valinor in the faint hope that they could make a final plea on behalf of those who suffered under Morgoth.
