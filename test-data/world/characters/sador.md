# Sador

**Sador Onefoot**, also known as **Sadog** and **Labadal**, was an old woodwright who served Húrin and Morwen as a servant in Dor-lómin. He was also Túrin's friend during his childhood.

## Biography
Sador was one of the Drúedain who lived within the household of Húrin. He became a woodman in his youth and learned how to carve and craft things out of wood. When the Dagor Bragollach broke out in the year 455, Sador was called upon from his tasks in the woods to fight. He came too late to the battle field however, only being able to bring back his fallen lord Hador on a bier. Afterwards, Sador become a soldier, thus being stationed at Eithel Sirion for many years with little to mark them. He was there in the year 462 defending Barad Eithel, when Galdor fell and Húrin took up his command, leading them to drive the Orcs back, never coming within sight of Eithel Sirion again. Sometime later, Sador grew tired of war, and obtained leave to return to the woods that he yearned for, becoming a woodman again. Yet tragedy struck when, by ill-luck, he mishandled his axe and accidentally severed his right foot, after which, Sador obtained a crutch and his footless leg had shrunken from a lack of use.

In the years that followed, Sador became a retainer He was possibly given this task by Húrin instead of choosing to do so of his own accord.

Before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad, Húrin left to go to war in the month of Lothron. When Morwen first told Túrin that he was to go to Doriath, he hoped that Sador could go with him, only for Morwen to say he wouldn’t because it would be "a hard road" for him. The next morning, Túrin found Sador preparing to use the unfinished great chair of Húrin as firewood and tried to convince him that Húrin would return and be pleased with the chair. However, Sador explained that "false hopes" would not keep them warm in the coming winter. He nonetheless added that the true purpose of the chair was the joy of making it. Sador then talked with him about the necessity of his departure. Túrin was sad but understood. Sador also urged him to take back the Elven knife. Túrin refused, saying that he would get many things like it in Doriath.

Sador stayed in the house of Morwen for a long while, but soon after Morwen and Niënor left to go to Doriath, he became a vagabond to avoid being enslaved by the Easterlings like the rest of the Men of Dor-lómin. Nonetheless, he was often given broth and a place by the fire in Brodda's hall because Aerin somehow forced Brodda to keep "some of the kindlier manners of old". Sador was among the vagabonds and servants who believed that Túrin had become "a king or a lord in some south country" and had summoned Morwen and Niënor from Dor-lómin. Sador was resting by the fire in Brodda's hall when a grief-stricken vagabond came to the hall and "was given a seat by the fire" and some broth before asking for news of Morwen, shocking Sador and the others by speaking "the old tongue". Sador warned him to speak quieter, deducing that he was of the House of Hador. He then revealed all he knew about Morwen, revealed his name, and reminisced on the years before the Nírnaeth Arnoediad. Upon learning that the other man was Túrin, Sador took him outside the hall and learned that he did not summon Morwen and Niënor. After Sador told him that Aerin might know of Morwen's whereabouts, Túrin re-entered the hall and received answers from Aerin. However, after realizing Glaurung's trickery in sending him there, he killed Brodda and three weaponless Easterlings, instigating a rebellion in the hall. Sador partook in this uprising, but was fatally wounded in the "great fighting" that followed. He was, however, able to say his final words to Túrin before perishing, warning him to flee before the Easterlings return with reinforcements.

- Sadog* is a Drúadan name with an unknown meaning. and a lenited variant of the noun *tâl* ("foot, end"), derived from the root *TAL*.

## In other versions
In the earliest form of the legendarium published in , the predecessors of Sador included an unnamed passer-by who Turambar met outside Mavwin's abandoned house, and a Man of Hisilómë named ***Orlin***, who was akin to Turambar himself through Mavwin. In the tale of Turambar and the Foalókë that was told to Eriol by Eltas, when Turambar came to Mavwin's house and discovered it empty, a person "who was passing on to other dwellings" encountered him and told him what happened before directing him to Brodda's hall. After Turambar entered the hall and murdered the lord in vengeance, Orlin was one of the few men present there who tried to seize Turambar, and was the only one killed. When Airin appeared and the people waited for her judgement, she explained that Turambar had indeed committed a grave crime by killing someone akin to his mother and in a hall of feast. However, since he killed Orlin in defense of himself, Túrin could only be condemned to exile. Thus, Orlin's death caused Túrin to flee Hisilómë, just as Sador tells Túrin to flee as he died in the latest version.

In *The Grey Annals*, which Tolkien wrote after writing about Túrin's friendship with Sador, the character does not appear in the fight in Brodda's hall. Despite this, Christopher Tolkien speculated that this was because of extreme condensation.
