# Urthel

**Urthel** was an Edain of the House of Bëor and one of the XII Bëorings who followed Barahir in the First Age.

## Biography

After the Dagor Bragollach, Urthel remained with Barahir and his company, who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Morgoth, and thus they became outlaws, surviving for nearly five years in the barren highlands above the forest of Dorthonion, then in the hands of Morgoth. He and the others were eventually betrayed to Sauron by the unhappy Gorlim and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
