# Saruman

**Saruman**, also known as **Saruman the White**, was the first of the Istari (Wizards), the emissaries of the Valar sent to Middle-earth in the Third Age to help the Free Peoples of the World to counter the possible return of Sauron. He was originally the chief and greatest of the Five Istari, as well as the head of the White Council that for a time opposed the re-emergence of the Dark Lord. For many years he was regarded as an ally of  Gondor and Rohan, and was even granted guardianship of the tower of Orthanc as part of the defense of the West.

However, after studying the works of Sauron, particularly the lore of the Rings of Power, Saruman, overcome by pride and greed, betrayed his allies and swore fealty to Sauron, becoming one of his greatest servants. The Wizard, however, plotted to betray his "new master" as well and usurp his place as ruler of Middle-earth by claiming the One Ring for himself, or at least to become his right hand. In the War of the Ring, Saruman marshalled an army at Isengard to both conquer Rohan at Sauron's behest and try to claim the One Ring for himself.

After his master's downfall and his own failure to obtain the Ring or subjugate Rohan, Saruman journeyed to the Shire, where a host of Ruffians had already seized control of it through Lotho Sackville-Baggins, until Hobbits revolted and liberated the land, and exiled him. He was then slain by Gríma Wormtongue, his servant whom he had long abused. Following the death of Saruman's physical body, his spirit was rejected by the Valar due to his treachery.

## Biography
### Origin
Saruman was originally a powerful Maia of Aulë the Smith named *Curumo* (later in Sindarin, *Curunír*). From the beginning, he was much like Sauron,

Curumo was one of those who volunteered, whereas the last one, Olórin, (later known as "Gandalf") was commanded by Manwë to go too. It was from this point that Curumo began to be jealous of Olórin, due to Varda's decision to send Olórin not as the third Istar, but as the second. He also was charged to take Aiwendil (later called "Radagast") to please Yavanna, which Curumo did not wish to do, and this led to contempt for the latter Wizard. The others who were chosen were Alatar and Pallando (the Blue Wizards). Curumo then was appointed overall leader of the group. Only the keeper of the havens, Círdan the Shipwright, knew Curumo's nature and purpose. Curumo would later discover that Círdan had given Narya, the Red Ring, to Olórin upon their first landing in Middle-earth. Even though Curumo was recognized as the head of the order while Olórin was not, Círdan had divined Olórin as the wisest and greatest of the Istari. Curumo's jealousy of Olórin grew from these events, perhaps because he feared that he would eventually supplant him as chief of the Wizards.

To the Elves, Curumo became known as *Curunír*, whereas Men called him Saruman, the name by which he was afterwards remembered. The White Messenger and the two Blue Wizards went into the east of Middle-earth and their fate after this was unknown. After one and a half millennia, Saruman returned to the west, just as Sauron's power was growing again at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood.

#### The White Council

When the White Council was formed around the year 2463 of the Third Age to counter Sauron, Saruman was appointed its leader, though Galadriel wanted Gandalf in this position. Although Gandalf had declined leadership, Saruman continued to resent the Grey Pilgrim. He also had an intense dislike for Radagast, whom he dismissed as a fool. 

At this point Saruman had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron. This was also the same year that Sauron's One Ring was taken by the Stoor Sméagol (later called Gollum), who disappeared with it into the Misty Mountains for hundreds of years. The White Wizard then began to study the lore of the Rings of Power. However, his extensive research on the Rings eventually led him to admire the Dark Lord, which then caused him to fall into the folly of imitating him. Saruman believed he could be the ruler of Middle-earth, in Sauron's likeness, and "have his own will by force". As he had hoped, Saruman also found one of the remaining palantíri in Orthanc, but deceptively concealed his discovery from the rest of the White Council. 

In TA 2850, Gandalf entered Dol Guldur and confirmed that the evil presence within was indeed Sauron. He then advised the White Council that they should attack Sauron. However, Saruman advised against this by deceitfully claiming that the One Ring would never be found. With almost the entire Council deceived, they did not attack. However, the Grey Pilgrim would later remark that it was at this meeting that he first began to suspect that the White Wizard desired to attain the One Ring. Saruman's real intention was to allow Sauron to build up his strength, so that the Ring would reveal itself and he could claim it first, so he was willing to let Sauron be for the time being. 

Concealing his contempt, Saruman deceitfully persuaded Radagast to teach him how to tame birds and beasts; these he used as spies for his own purposes, unbeknownst to the Brown Wizard. He later found that the Enemy had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected. Therefore, in TA 2941, Saruman finally agreed to an assault upon Dol Guldur. The attack was successful, and by the devices of the White Wizard, the Dark Lord was driven from the fortress.

At the last meeting of the White Council in TA 2953, Saruman lied to the Council about the Ring being "passed down Anduin to the Sea". He then ceased all cooperation with the Wise, taking Isengard for his own and fortifying it. Surrounding himself with "all who hated Gondor and Rohan" (i.e. Northern Orcs from the Misty Mountains, Dunlendings and other evil things), Saruman troubled the borders of the Rohirrim during the reign of Thengel and began building his own army. Around TA 2990, Saruman started the "special breeding" of Orcs at Isengard and, as Morgoth and Sauron had done before him, crossbred Orcs with Men to make Half-orcs, But Saruman was, in truth, a faithless vassal, who coveted the Ring for himself. The fallen Wizard's endgame was to usurp his "new master"

Working under orders from Mordor and also eager to expand his own dominion, the  Wizard plotted to "deliver" Rohan to his "dark master". trees were cut down and replaced by caverns filled with forges, furnaces and other machines. Around TA 3000, Saruman sent many of his Uruk-hai to join the Northern Orcs and the Mordor-orcs in raiding the eastern villages of Rohan. To further weaken the kingdom, Saruman bought Gríma Wormtongue, Théoden's counselor, with the promise of Éowyn's hand by TA 3014 and used him as a mole in the royal court to sap the king's strength with deceitful advice and poisons. Suspecting a potential connection between the Ring and the Shire (based mostly on Gandalf's interest there), Saruman instructed his agents to infiltrate the Shire and keep tabs on the comings and goings of any important Hobbits. His dealings with Pipe-weed had also earned him allies among the Sackville-Baggins and Bracegirdle families, who owned many plantations. Saruman also used his agents in Eriador to keep watch on the Dúnedain protecting the Shire, as well as to mislead Sauron's more trustworthy informants. before sending him as captive to Sauron in Mordor;

Commanded by Sauron, Saruman moved against Théoden to keep Rohan from riding to Gondor's aid. With Gríma preventing any military mobilization within the kingdom, Saruman sent large raiding forces to wreak havoc in the Westfold of Rohan. The only true obstacles to his invasion were Théoden's son and nephew, Théodred and Éomer respectively. As Wormtongue had failed to turn the two men against each other,  the White Wizard tasked his servants to slay the king's heir at all costs. Per this special order, the warriors of Isengard engaged the defenders of Rohan at the Fords of Isen; the First Battle at the Fords of Isen ended in the death of Théodred followed by the retreat of Saruman's hordes. At the same time, the Wizard also betrayed his master: he sent trusted warbands to hunt down the Fellowship and capture the Ring-bearer. Saruman's scouts, led by Uglúk, ambushed the company at Amon Hen, where they took Pippin and Merry captive, while also shooting Boromir "with many black-feathered arrows" when he tried to defend the Hobbits. Slowed on their way back to Isengard by conflict with Mordor-orcs loyal to Sauron, the Isengarders were slain on the eaves of Fangorn by Rohirrim led by Éomer. Gimli believed he had glimpsed Saruman at the site of the skirmish, presumably having hastened to claim the Ring from the Hobbits.

The Wizard's position was becoming dangerously isolated: he lacked the Ring, his neighbors he had "made [his] enemies" and he had also "cheated [his] new master". Believing he might yet claim lordship over Rohan and regain Sauron's favor by delivering the Rohirrim to him,

Gandalf, who had returned from death to accomplish the mission Saruman did not, expelled the turncoat from the ranks of the Istari and the White Council and broke his staff. Saruman also lost the *palantír* of Orthanc when Gríma threw it off a balcony, undecided about which he hated more, Saruman or Gandalf, and hitting neither. Even so, Gandalf muses that Saruman will prove a faithless servant and that Sauron is already aware of that. In addition, his intention to usurp his new master (mentioned in movie tie-ins like  and Wētā Workshop merchandise) is only implied in the trilogy itself. However, a deleted scene had Saruman propose to Gandalf that, if they could wield the Ring's power, they could betray Sauron and "command Middle-earth" Sir Christopher Lee also pointed out that although "Saruman becomes Sauron’s servant", he still plots to supplant him as Lord of the Rings. While Saruman's interactions with Gandalf are toned down in the theatrical cut, the extended edition emphasizes Saruman's grudge against Gandalf, alluding to similar passages from  and .  

Unlike in the source material, the title of "Saruman of Many Colours" is omitted, and he is referred to only as "Saruman the White". Instead of being "woven of all colours", the robes were made cream white to suggest that, even after his defection to the service of the Dark Lord, the Wizard considers himself unfallen.  Saruman's staff of power is shown as a talisman of his authority, resembling Orthanc, with a white crystal set between the four spires.

#### Background

Saruman was originally the chief and greatest of Istari, sent to aid the Free Peoples make their stand against Sauron. The White Wizard "could exert much control over men's minds" through his voice and his skill earned him the Elven name *Curunír*. His researches into the lore of Middle-earth,  especially Sauron's works, led him to believe that he could be the ruler of Middle-earth in the likeness of Sauron. He settled in Orthanc at Isengard, both to establish a seat of power and to use the Palantír. Ultimately, he was ensnared by the Dark Lord and became his servant and a traitor to the White Council. However, the White Council would not be aware of his betrayal for some time. Although acting out his new master's will, Saruman secretly plotted to usurp Sauron's place. Saruman recruited the Orcs of the Misty Mountains, allied with the Dunlendings and bred his own Uruk-hai by crossbreeding Orcs with Goblin-men.

#### *The Fellowship of the Ring*

After Gandalf rides to Isengard to seek his counsel, Saruman reveals his betrayal, announces his designs, and urges him to join with Sauron. When the Grey Pilgrim refuses, a duel ensues between the two Wizards. In the end, Saruman overpowers Gandalf and  imprisons him on the pinnacle of Orthanc. He later uses his Seeing Stone to receive his master's instructions. Commanded to build "an army worthy of Mordor", Saruman calls his Orcs, and openly begins preparations for war: the concealed network of forges, furnaces and palisades is revealed, trees are cut for fuel and Uruk-hai are bred in the caverns. Saruman confronts Gandalf once more atop Orthanc, trying to coerce him into submitting to Sauron or embracing the One Ring's power for themselves. Gandalf dismisses Saruman's delusions of grandeur: Saruman will not supplant Sauron as Lord of the Rings, nor will Sauron share power with his servant. To Saruman's surprise, Gandalf then flees on the Great Eagle Gwaihir's back, leaving him empty-handed.  

Saruman later tracks the Fellowship using Crebain, who spot the company near Hollin and report back to their lord. Guessing that the heroes will choose to take the pass of Caradhras, the Wizard summons massive snow avalanches and rock-slides to try and hinder the Fellowship. Still trying to seize the Ring before Sauron, Saruman keeps the first hundred Uruk-hai for his own elite force and learns, through the Palantír,   that the Fellowship is in Lothlórien. He then sends his loyal minion, Lurtz, to bring the Hobbits - and thus the Ring - back to Isengard. Saruman's Uruk-hai troop ambushes the company at Amon Hen, where they slay Boromir and capture Merry and Pippin. 

#### *The Two Towers*

Saruman begins his war against Théoden at Sauron's command. He first convinces the tribal chief Wulf to ally Dunland with Isengard and Mordor against Rohan; then he sends raiding parties of Isengard Orcs and Dunlendings to wreak havoc the Westfold. Alarmed at the slow movement of his Uruk-hai troop with the Hobbits, Saruman hastens in building Sauron a second army to conceal his treachery. Through the Seeing Stone, the Wizard reports to his new master and assures him that their dominion over Middle-earth draws near. Underestimating the Ents' ire, Saruman approves the cutting of Fangorn to fuel his war machine. It is soon revealed that Saruman has bought Rohan's steward, Gríma, using him to addle Théoden's mind to make Rohan fall before Sauron. Through Wormtongue's poisons, the Wizard influences and outright possesses the King at will, assuming lordship over the land. To remove another threat to his control over Rohan, Saruman's warriors attack and mortally-wound Théoden's son, Théodred, in battle at the Fords of Isen. Saruman's Uruk-hai, however, are waylaid by Éomer's Rohirrim and the captive Hobbits escape into Fangorn, while his hold over Théoden is broken by the resurrected Gandalf. 

Having tried (and failed) to claim the Ring, the Wizard is driven by fear of his master's wrath and seeks to appease him. Learning of Aragorn's existence and Théoden's flight from Edoras, Saruman prepares his army at Isengard to crush Rohan and slay the Heir of Isildur with a single stroke, thus regaining Sauron's favor. As Théoden's people departs Edoras for Helm's Deep, Saruman sends Sharku's Warg-mounted pack to harrass them. Having amassed 10,000 warriors, he unleashes them at his dark master's behest to destroy the world of Men. Aided by Saruman's devices, such as ladders and blasting-powder bombs, the Uruk-hai overrun the Rohirrim and their Galadhrim allies at Helm's Deep. The tide turns by the end thanks to Gandalf's reinforcements, however, and Saruman's legions are defeated. The vengeful Ents also besiege Isengard and flood it, ending Saruman's reign of terror and depriving Sauron of his service.

#### *The Return of the King*

Saruman does not appear in the theatrical cut of ; Treebeard only suggests that his power is no more. In the , Gandalf, Aragorn, Théoden, Gimli, Legolas, Éomer, Merry and Pippin confront Saruman in Isengard. At first, the corrupted Wizard feigns humility and tries to barter for peace with the King. When Théoden instead demands justice, Saruman dismisses him and begins mocking Gandalf. Gandalf also reprimands him for his misdeeds, but offers him the chance to repent by revealing Sauron's plans. The corrupted Wizard merely taunts them that his master's attack, which will bring about their death, is imminent. Saruman then tries to slay Gandalf, only for the uninjured Gandalf to effortlessly break his staff and expel him from the Istari ranks. Embittered, he denies the mistreated Gríma freedom of service by smacking him, and belittles Théoden. As he is about to tell his adversaries where their "doom" will be, he is stabbed in the back by Wormtongue, who had reached his breaking point. After Saruman's lifeless body falls from Orthanc's pinnacle onto one of his machines' spiked wheel, the Palantír drops from his sleeve.

The Scouring of the Shire, which is where the Dark Lord's puppet meets his end in the novels, is entirely omitted from the film adaptations, although certain actions such as Saruman being killed by Gríma before the latter was felled by an arrow did reference the event indirectly. Peter Jackson considered the Scouring anticlimactic.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

Sir Christopher Lee reprised the role in Peter Jackson's live action . He originally expressed interest in voicing the Dragon Smaug, but the role ended up going to Benedict Cumberbatch. Christopher Lee also managed to humor Peter Jackson by asking him "Am I still in the movie?" This refers to when Christopher Lee's (Saruman's) death scene was cut from the theatrical version of *The Return of the King* and he had a falling out with Peter Jackson a decade before. Deriving from his actions' description in *The Silmarillion*, Saruman is depicted as frequently opposing Gandalf, hindering his efforts out of spite while maintaining the facade of an "old friend" as head of the White Council. Certain scenes also imply his vast knowledge of Sauron's devices, implying he has secretly grown enamored of his ways and power.

In , he arrives in Rivendell for a meeting of the White Council. Irked by what he perceives as Gandalf's contesting of his authority, Saruman expressing his disapproval concerning the quest to reclaim the Erebor and belittles Gandalf  for  'looking for trouble where none exists'. He questions his fear of a potential alliance between the Dragon Smaug and a returned Sauron, while also claiming that the vanishing Dwarven Rings were of no value to the Enemy without the lost Ruling Ring. The White Wizard also appears to be skeptical of the information the Grey Pilgrim provides on the Necromancer and he further dismisses the information when he learns it came from the Brown Wizard, who he believes is a fool and an embarrassment on their order due to his consumption of mushrooms. When presented with the Morgul blade, Saruman states there is no proof that it belonged to the Witch-king of Angmar. The White Wizard sums up all of the Grey Pilgrim's concerns as nothing to worry about but, as final slight, he states that he feels he cannot condone the quest of the Dwarves to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. However, Gandalf had foreseen Saruman's pettiness and had beforehand bid Thorin Oakenshield's company leave Rivendell without him.

In , Saruman arrives at Dol Guldur along with Elrond, after being summoned there by Galadriel, to rescue Gandalf. Saruman appears as Galadriel and Gandalf are surrounded by the Nazgûl and offers his assistance. At this, two of the Nine turn towards him and both he and the Elf-lord begin to battle with the Ringwraiths. Saruman duels several of the Nazgûl, appearing to be able to handle up to two at a time. In the end, they overpower the Nine, who retreat momentarily. After Gandalf is taken away by Radagast, Sauron appears before the remainder of the White Council along with the returning Nazgûl. The White Wizard readies himself for further battle but appears to be paralyzed with awe of the Dark Lord's power. Galadriel rises in a terrifying ethereal form and begins a battle of wills with Sauron. The Wizard barely seems to notice this, still stunned in amazement and dread of the Enemy. Galadriel eventually gains the upper hand and banishes Sauron from Dol Guldur. After recovering from his shock, Saruman notes that while Galadriel has banished Sauron, it took nearly all of her power to do it and tells Elrond to take her back to Lothlórien, When the Elf argues that the One Enemy must be found and permanently destroyed, the Wizard replies that without the One Ring, the Dark Lord will never regain his full strength. He then tells them to go and 'leave Sauron to me.' This is most likely the point, where Saruman embraces the path that will see him become an opportunistic servant of Sauron. 

There is also a song called "The Voice of Saruman" created by the heavy metal band called "Lorien."

### In radio versions

#### *The Battle for Middle-earth*

The evil campaign of  begins with the White Wizard's open defection to the Dark Lord's service, followed by Isengard's expansion, the cutting of Fangorn and the conquest of Rohan, signified by the fall of Helm's Deep and the deaths of both Théoden and Éomer.

In  and its expansion , Saruman does not take part in the campaign since BFME II shows the War in the North. While ROTWK is set before Saruman's arrival in Middle-earth, in all games however, he does appear as the main hero for Isengard in skirmish battles. 

Saruman starts off with the standard wizard blast power which can destroy an entire battalion of infantry (Without armor upgrades) His second ability was a fireball, very useful for blasting away heroes and flyers. His third power was called "Wormtounge" this ability allows Saruman to gain control of units with the power of his voice (Note: This power was temporary the units will return to their original faction after a minute or so. However if the player commands the controlled unit to attack and destroy an enemy building the unit remains in Saruman's possession) His next power was Speechcraft. This allows friendly units to gain a major boost in experience. His final power was Lightning Blast, in which Saruman casts down a mighty lightning strike that can decimate infantry (With armor upgrades).

#### *The Lord of the Rings: Conquest*
In the first mission of , Saruman sends his army at Sauron's command to assault Théoden's people at Helm's Deep, which ends in his defeat. In the next mission, Isengard is attacked by the Ents and the Rohirrim; once the pits of Isengard are captured, the Rohirrim and Ents struggle towards Orthanc, from where Saruman directs the defense. Later in the mission, the player gets to take control of Gandalf, and is led  up through the stairs inside the Tower of Orthanc to confront Saruman in a duel (the setting is the same as seen in *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, however this time Gandalf is on an equal level of power if not stronger than Saruman . Once the player succeeds in killing Saruman, then the player can move on.

In the evil campaign, Sauron regains the One Ring and uses his power to recall 

His power stretches enough that he recalls his most potent servants (Saruman and the Witch-king) and his uneasy ally, the Balrog Durin's Bane. After the retaking of Osgiliath, Saruman is given a large army by Sauron to conquer the weakened Minas Tirith, Saruman is at the front line of the Orc force breaking through the ranks of Gondorian soldiers as he reaches out to complete his objective of destroying (burning) the White Tree and does so (fulfilling the vision Pippin had seen).

Later we see Saruman leading the assault on Weathertop, where Aragorn with the aid of Gondorians, the Ents and the Great Eagles making a last stand against Sauron, defending Rivendell and the Shire. The White Wizard is sent to kill the Heir of Isildur, who stands at the peak of Weathertop waiting. Saruman succeeds in killing Aragorn and so Sauron moves out to destroy Rivendell.

In the game, Saruman's staff is the same as that of the Mouth of Sauron. Saruman's specialty in the game is the area attack, where he will strike the staff against the floor and punch the ground sending out two shock waves, much more powerful and causing more damage than the standard mage. His melee attack is also quick and swift, and his magic and glow of the staff is purple.

#### *The Lord of the Rings Online*

In , Saruman can be seen inside the tower of Orthanc, both during the "Epic Quest" involving Isengard and the "instances" set inside and under the tower, in the depths. He can also be seen once in the Dunlending village of Avardin.

#### *Lego: The Lord of the Rings*
In the  game, Saruman is a playable character with unique abilities. Saruman's staff can levitate specific Lego objects, provide light in dark places, shoot energy bolts and conjure up a magical barrier.

He can be found atop Orthanc, which the player must use a variety of characters to ascend. He can be purchased for 500,000 studs.

#### *LEGO: The Hobbit*
In , Saruman is able destroy silver LEGO objects and can be found in Rivendell.
