# Tar-Atanamir

**Tar-Atanamir** also known as **Atanamir the Great** was the thirteenth King of Númenor.

## Biography

Tar-Atanamir succeeded his father, King Tar-Ciryatan, in SA 2029. He was married to an unnamed woman and had a son named Tar-Ancalimon and another unnamed child that eventually led up to Herucalmo. Tar-Atanamir began to speak against the Valar in particular the Ban of the Valar and the Gift of Ilúvatar. He was also the first king who was unwilling to give up his throne voluntarily before his death, and to let himself die while he was still strong in mind and body. His reign is thus generally considered to constitute the beginning of Númenor's moral decline.
