# Ungoliant

**Ungoliant** (Sindarin; IPA: ), also known as **Gloomweaver**, the **Great Spider Who Enmeshes**, **Del-du-thling**, and **Ungoliantë**, was a spirit who took on the form of a monstrous Spider. She was initially an ally of Melkor in Aman, and for a short time in Middle-earth as well. She was a distant mother of Shelob, and the oldest giant spider of Arda. She was "the primeval devourer of light" and the destroyer of the Two Trees of Valinor.

## Appearance
The origins of Ungoliant are unspecified, except that she had been a spirit, entering Arda and taking the form of a giant spider. As a spirit being, she would only be perceptible to those that could perceive spirits and the spirit world. It is implied that her spirit form was one of pure darkness, reflected in her physical form. Since the Valar, Maiar, and other spirits in the physical world freely took on forms that reflected their nature, Ungoliant's terrifying and monstrous form did the same. While her form was described as being that of a giant spider, and she is credited as the "first" giant spider, the narrative indicates that, much like her descendant Shelob, she had many features that distinguished her from the common form of a spider.

## Biography
### Early years

The true origins of Ungoliant are shrouded in mystery. It was believed by some of the Eldar that she may have been among the Ainur whom Melkor "had corrupted long ago" in the beginning, yet she was not listed among the known Ainur. It was later perceived by the Valar that she had descended from "beyond Arda" in the "darkness that" lay around it when Melkor first gazed upon the Kingdom of Manwë in envy.. When Ungoliant refused to leave her lair after Melkor taunted and commanded her to emerge, Melkor threatened to bury her "under black stone" whilst enticing her with two shining green gems. When Ungoliant slowly emerged, Melkor withheld the gems However, upon understanding Melkor's true purpose of destroying the Two Trees of Valinor, a great fear overcame her as she was unwilling to risk the power of the Valar and come out of hiding. It was only when Melkor had personally vowed to use both of his hands to satisfy her lust with whatever she demanded, that Ungoliant agreed to aid him. Ungoliant regained her strength causing them to slowly wither. Yet the thirst of Ungoliant was not satisfied and she drained the Wells of Varda as well, belching black vapors as she drank, growing to a vast and hideous shape beyond "her most lustful dream" that terrified even Melkor. and went with him to Formenos while her Unlight stymied the pursuit of Oromë and Tulkas. Ungoliant and Melkor then fled Aman through Araman and Oiomúrë, eventually crossing over the Helcaraxë to escape justice at the hands of the Valar. she attacked him, overpowering him and wrapping him in a "web of clinging throngs" in an effort to strangle him. The attempt on his own life caused Melkor to release an echoing cry of desperation through the mountains. The cry was so great and dreadful that the very land it was uttered in became known as Lammoth ever after. Unfortunately for Ungoliant, Melkor's cry of desperation had been heard by the Balrogs beneath the ruins of Angband. As tempests of fire, the Balrogs came swiftly to Lammoth to save the return of their lord. The webs of Ungoliant were smote asunder by their whips of flame, and forcing her to break off her attack. She fled in fear from them, covering herself with the black vapors which she belched. The Balrogs prepared to pursue and destroy her, but they were checked by Morgoth, who ordered them to return with him to Angband. There, Ungoliant met, mated, and eventually devoured the "other evil creatures of spider-form" whom had dwelt there since Angband was first delved. She had many offspring with them, including Shelob, before she eventually departed from that place, eventually heading to "the forgotten South of the world" and is a loan from *Ungoliantë* in Quenya. It consists of the words *ungol* ("spider") crossing, ford; bridge").

- Del-du-thling* is a Sindarin name possibly meaning "horror night spider" and consisting of the elements *del* ("horror"), *dû* ("dim, dark; dimness, night; night-fall, late evening"), and *thling* ("spider, spider’s web, cobweb"). It consists of the words *ungwë* ("spider gloom; spider's web") or *ungo* ("cloud, dark shadow") and *liantë* ("tendril; vine; spider")

## In other versions
In the state of the mythology in 1916, when J.R.R. Tolkien had gone to serve in the First World War, the first precursor to Ungoliant was **Ungwë-Tuita**, the **Spider of Night**, who once was close to ensnaring Eärendil. Even earlier, before the , she was called **Gungliont**. In that version, after helping Melkor destroy the Two Trees, she left, instead of attacking Melkor as in later versions. The Eldar called her **Virilomë**, or ***Wirilomë*** in Qenya. In Sindarin, this name is translated into ***Gwerlum***.

## In adaptations
### *Middle-earth Role Playing*
In the , Ungoliant is considered to be a Demon of the Void and the incarnation of darkness and destruction.

### *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*
In Peter Jackson's 2012 , Radagast describes the spiders he saw as "some kind of spawn of Ungoliant" while discussing the darkness that has fallen over Mirkwood.

### *Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor*
In the 2014 video-game, , Ungoliant is mentioned twice: The first time is in a memory attached to the "Crushed Ungol Egg" artifact, during which Sauron's servant addresses Shelob as the "last daughter of Ungoliant". She is mentioned again when Talion and the Wraith discuss the Ungol spiders that infest Mordor.
