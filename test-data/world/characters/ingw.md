# Ingwë

**Ingwë** was the Vanyarin Elf who held titles of **King of the Vanyar** and **High King of the Elves**. He dwelt in Ingwemar with the rest of his House. He was the uncle of Finwë's second wife Indis.

## Biography
Ingwë was born in Cuiviénen during the Years of the Trees to Ilion, a direct descendant of Imin and Iminyë. After Oromë discovered the Quendi, Ingwë was part of the first embassy to Aman alongside his friends Finwë and Elwë, and became the lord of the first Kindred of the Elves, the later Vanyar, who led his people in the Great Journey. His name means "first one / chief" in Quenya.

First of the Vanyar to travel to Valinor with Oromë, Ingwë loved its beauty and bliss and, returning to his people, urged them to undertake a journey to Aman. He and his kin took the journey, were fascinated with the Valar, and decided not to return to Middle-earth. They stayed and made Ingwë their king. The Mindon Eldaliéva, in Tirion, was built in honor of him.

Ingwë was reckoned as High King of all the Eldalië, the Elves of the Great Journey, and was therefore called **Ingwë Ingweron**, the "Chief of the Chieftains". He lived on Taniquetil, ruling under Manwë, High King of Arda.

After establishing himself at Taniquetil, Ingwë never set foot in Middle-earth again. When the Vanyar took up arms in the War of Wrath and followed the Host of Valinor, Ingwë did not join them, but his son Ingwion did, and led the Vanyarin warriors, capturing Eglarest in the first battle of the war.

## Titles
In all of Arda's history, only Ingwë was titled **High King of the Elves**, as, during his time, he was revered by all Elves as their ruler. The title came into being sometime after the Elves were well established in Aman. As Ingwë was already the appointed King of the Vanyar, and as the Vanyar were drawn to Valinor and were close to the Valar, all Elves blessed by Manwë hailed Ingwë as their most high king.

**King of the Vanyar** was the noble title of the supreme head of the Vanyar elves. Ingwë held this title also, and is the only known one to have been their king. The Vanyar made him King after his return from Valinor as their ambassador.

## In other versions
In earlier writings, Ingwë was named ***Inwë*** and known as King of all the Eldar of Kôr, or King of the Fairies, or Lord of the Teleri (instead of the Vanyar, as later), who led them to lands of Men. His son Ingwion was initially named *Ingil*.

The Gnomes (Tolkien's precursor to the Ñoldor) called him **Inwithiel**. He was also referred to as **Isil** or **Isil Inwë**.
