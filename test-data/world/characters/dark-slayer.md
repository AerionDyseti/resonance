## Overview

The Dark Slayer was a spectral undead entity encountered by the Keys to Perfection party in the ancient cistern beneath the Solaar Desert oasis. A gaunt, shadowy figure with spectral claws, it flickered between corporeal and incorporeal states and emanated a presence that muted sound around it.

## Origin

In life, the Dark Slayer was a warrior of the **Hinandyr Barbarians**, a nomadic clan from the frozen northern wastes of Hyria. He bore the distinctive tribal tattoos of his people—marks that remained visible even in his spectral form.

During the **Darkness Wars**, he and his brother-in-arms (not blood kin, but bonded through shared survival) were tasked with transporting a powerful spear to safety. When the ground collapsed beneath them, they became sealed in the cistern with no way out.

As starvation set in and madness took hold, the warrior's mind broke. In a moment of overwhelming hatred—for those who started the war, for those who sent him on the mission, for his brother for simply existing and consuming their dwindling rations—he murdered his companion with the very spear they were meant to protect.

The trauma of this act, combined with the spear's absorption of the event's dark energy, transformed him into the Dark Slayer upon death.

## Combat Abilities

- **Incorporeality**: Could shift between solid and shadow forms; damage reduction when not fully manifested
- **Silence Magic**: Cast silence on the resonant pillars to disrupt the party's defensive strategy
- **Fear Aura**: Could project terrifying visions that caused targets to flee
- **Echo Wight Summoning**: Controlled shadow undead that emerged from the fissure

## Defeat

The party discovered that the resonant pillars in the cistern could force the Dark Slayer into a more vulnerable state and damage it when it crossed their sonic barriers. Through coordinated attacks and tactical pillar activation, they defeated the entity, which dissolved into shadow and sound as the final pillars sealed the fissure.

## Legacy

The Dark Slayer's remains—along with those of his murdered brother—were found at the bottom of the fissure. The cursed spear that absorbed his final act of violence was recovered by the party and secured in Shemsu's efficient quiver for transport to the Temple of Light for purification.

### **Special Abilities**

**Semicorporeal (Su)**
Not quite as intangible as a truly incorporeal creature, the Dark Slayer takes half damage from non-magical attack forms. This ability is overcome by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities as normal. This ability is suppressed while the Dark Slayer is under the effects of *Resonance Suppression*.

**Drain Tether (Su)**
On a successful spectral tendril attack, the target must succeed on a **DC 19 Fortitude save** or become tethered to the Dark Slayer by a tendril of negative energy.

- At the start of the tethered creature's turn, they must make a **DC 19 Fortitude save** or take **one negative level**. This effect is suppressed if the Dark Slayer is under the effects of *Resonance Suppression*.
- A creature (either the target or an adjacent ally) can use a **Standard Action** to remove the tether by succeeding on a **DC 15 Strength check** (to forcibly break it) or a **DC 15 Heal check** (to safely detach it).
- The tether is also automatically broken if the target moves more than 60 ft. from the Dark Slayer.

**Siphon Surge (Su)**
While in its lair, the Dark Slayer can draw power from the cracked cistern as a swift action every 1d4 rounds. When it does, a pulse of negative energy washes over the battlefield. All living creatures in a 60 ft. radius burst centered on the cistern take **2d6 negative energy damage** (Will DC 19 half). This is a mind-affecting effect.

**Weakness: Resonance Trap (Ex)**
The seven holy bells in this chamber can create a "holy fence" to contain the Dark Slayer.

- **Activating a Bell:** A creature can use a **Standard Action** to strike a bell (a melee attack roll against AC 10).
- **Resonant Fence:** An activated bell "rings" **until the start of the ringer's next turn.** A ringing bell projects lines of holy energy to all other ringing bells within 120 feet, creating a visible "fence."
- **Consecrated Ground:** The area enclosed by these "fence" lines becomes *consecrated ground*.

**Weakness: Resonance Suppression (Ex)**
If the Dark Slayer starts its turn on *consecrated ground* (or is moved into it), it is *grounded* and its containment is re-established.

- While suppressed, it loses its **fly speed** (retaining a land speed of 5 ft.), **fast healing**, **semi-corporeal** defensive ability, **DR**, and **SR**.
- The negative level effect of its **Drain Tethers** is also suppressed during this time, though the tethers themselves are not broken.
- The suppression ends if the boss is no longer on *consecrated ground*.
