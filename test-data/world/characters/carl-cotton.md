Born in , Carl and his siblings spent much time in Bywater, and would often swim in the Bywater Pool with the Gamgee children. He had not yet come of age when Sharkey's Ruffians entered the Shire, so his father ordered him to guard the house with a pitch fork while his father and brothers fought in the Battle of Bywater.
