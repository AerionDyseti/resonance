# Bilbo Baggins

**Bilbo Baggins** was a Hobbit who lived in The Shire during the final years of the Third Age. His adventure with the dwarves Thorin and Company earned him a fortune, and brought the One Ring of Sauron back into knowledge. 

## Personality
Before his adventures, Bilbo was considered a very prim and respectable Hobbit for his polite disposition and aversion to anything out of the ordinary.  He had strict culinary and hygienic principles, being often less than thrilled with the rough conditions of travel at first.  But, being the son of Bungo Baggins and Belladonna Took, Bilbo had blood from two important Hobbit families, the Bagginses and the Tooks. Because of his adventurous "Tookish side" (which sometimes conflicted with his stay-at-home "Baggins side"), Baggins was rather restless and "strange" for a Hobbit. After his return from Erebor, he was regarded much less fondly than before by his fellow Hobbits, but paid them no mind.  Though considering himself happily retired from adventures, he often left his home for many days to meet with old friends and strangers, including Dwarves. 

Bilbo was noteworthy as the first ring-bearer in the history of Middle-earth to give up the One Ring voluntarily; he surrendered the ring to Frodo Baggins at Gandalf's request.

## History
### Early life

Bilbo Baggins was born on September 22 by Shire Reckoning, in the year  of the Third Age, the son of Bungo Baggins  and Belladonna Took. He was a grandson of the Old Took. about Dragons, Goblins and princesses and was impressed by the Wizard's fireworks. Bilbo also saw the Fell Winter, and was the last hobbit by the End of the Third Age to remember it. His role in the Winter is unknown. After the death of his parents, respectively in  and , he inherited Bag End. In the eyes of his neighbours, he originally seemed just like his father, a solid, sensible, unadventurous and respectable hobbit. But when becoming older he started to become "strange" and often left his home for many days to meet with strangers, including Dwarves. 

Eventually, Gandalf came to believe that Bilbo was the ideal person for an important task he had at hand, for Bilbo was both small-sized and adventurous. Gandalf came to the Shire to visit him in  but he had disappeared again because of Elven new year. He kept it with him for the rest of his adventure, wearing it inside his breeches.

#### Over the Misty Mountains

The next day the company left Rivendell

When Bilbo's consciousness returned he picked up a strange golden ring. After wandering through the dark passages he came to the lake of Gollum. Gollum, desiring to eat the hobbit but not willing to face his blade, engaged in a riddle contest. If Bilbo won, according to the predetermined rules, Gollum would lead him to safety. If Gollum won, Bilbo would allow himself to be eaten. As Bilbo saw no other way to escape, he agreed with Gollum's proposal.

Bilbo won the contest by accident, wondering out loud as he fingered the ring he had picked up, "What have I got in my pocket?" Gollum mistook this for a question, and Bilbo decided to stick to it. Gollum lost, but went back to his little island to take the ring Bilbo had picked up (as it was a magic ring) to turn himself invisible and kill the hobbit anyway. But of course the ring was not there, and Gollum, enraged, suddenly guessed that Bilbo had it. He chased Bilbo, but Bilbo unwittingly used the ring and escaped his notice. Gollum led Bilbo to the eastern door of the goblin-tunnels, through which Bilbo departed in safety.

The company had not journeyed long when they heard the howl of a Warg. On Gandalf's order they climbed in a group of trees. Bilbo, however, was not able to climb in one of the trees: Bilbo did not enjoy his experience being carried by his rescuers, apparently suffering from a fear of heights.

Later, a spider attacked Bilbo, who had fallen asleep. Bilbo woke up in time to defend himself with his little blade. He named his blade *Sting* after his first kill. Bilbo discovered that his companions had been captured by the spiders and stowed in their webs. Calling the spiders' names, he lured them away (with his ring) and came back to rescue the Dwarves. When the spiders returned, the dwarves fought them in a long battle. Eventually, the company won with no serious injuries, but found out that Thorin was missing. Unknown to Bilbo and the other Dwarves, he had been captured by the Wood-elves whose feasts they had interrupted.

Later, exploring the elven halls with the aid of his magic ring, Bilbo discovered that Thorin was also captured by Thranduil and devised a plan for the dwarves to escape. One day, Galion (Thranduil's butler) and the head of the guard, were drunk, and Bilbo was able to steal the keys. He freed the Dwarves from their cells and packed them in barrels. His plan worked, with the dwarves being packed and launched into the Forest River.  Poor Bilbo was forced to cling to the barrels, invisible, and grew cold and wet.

#### Encounter with the Dragon
On their way again, the party came to the Lonely Mountain when autumn waned. Thorin sent Balin, Fíli, Kíli and Bilbo to spy the Front Gate. Bilbo saw smoke coming out of the front gate, which made the party assume that Smaug was still alive. They returned to their camp and at Bilbo's suggestion they started to search for the Back Door at the western slopes of the Lonely Mountain. Eventually, the company discovered the back door. But none of them were able to open it, and Bilbo sat for days on the doorstep, thinking.  Soon the dwarves began to grumble about the hobbit, but Bilbo finally solved the riddle of the thrush knocking at the last light of Durin's Day:

The dwarves found that he was right, and with the key managed to open the passage.

Gandalf had indeed done well in choosing Bilbo, for the old worm did not recognise Bilbo's scent, neither could see him, and was puzzled.  Nevertheless he sensed the hobbit's presence, and challenged him. Knowing that it would be unwise to reveal his true name or stay quiet, Bilbo replied with a series of riddles, which no dragon can resist puzzling out.  Bilbo gave himself a series of names such as "Ringwinner" and "Luckwearer", referring to his adventures on the way to the Mountain.  Becoming pleased with his riddling, one of the names Bilbo conferred upon himself was "Barrel-rider", and flattered the dragon:

Meanwhile, in the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo and the dwarves decided to inspect the hoard while Smaug was away. During this time Bilbo stumbled across a gigantic and beautiful gem. Recalling an earlier conversation, Bilbo realised that it was the famous Arkenstone, but felt strangely reluctant to give it up. Instead, he put it in his pocket and continued on. After a song and gathering of treasure, Thorin gave Bilbo a beautiful coat of *mithril* as the first reward for his services. Thorin led the party to the front gate, and then Balin led them to the guardroom, where they sheltered.

After Bilbo and his companions awoke the next morning they found that many birds, including the aforementioned Trush, assembled at the Lonely Mountain. Although the Thrush tried to say something to the company, none of them could understand him. Therefore the Thrush summoned the raven Roäc, who was able to speak Westron. Roäc told Bilbo and the dwarves about the events in Lake-town and told Thorin about the approaching armies. He counselled them to make peace with Bard and Thranduil, though it cost them dearly in gold. Thorin rejected this advice and announced that he would not share the treasure with anyone. Then, Thorin sent Roäc as a messenger to his cousin Dáin, lord of the Iron Hills, to request aid. The next days they made preparations and blocked the gate with a wall, while they received news from the ravens.

#### The Battle of Five Armies and return journey

When Bard and Thranduil came to the Front gate, Thorin harshly responded in polite words to Bard.  Bard's reasoning did little for the stubborn King under the Mountain and Thorin rejected Bard's proposal to share the treasure.

Occasionally he received strange visitors; dwarves or Gandalf, or he often left the Shire for journeys from time to time. Other hobbits looked at him with amazement and suspicion, but his generous and kind nature put him high in the regard of those who knew him best especially the poorest and less significant hobbits.

Despite his health and youthfulness, Bilbo himself began to feel *stretched* and thin. As time passed and he used his magic ring (and perhaps because of Sauron's growing power), his mind was preoccupied with it, often worrying if it is safe and checking on it; once he tried locking it somewhere but he couldn't relax if it wasn't in his pocket, and wanted to use it more often. Sometimes he felt it like "an eye" watching on him. The next year he visited Rivendell and became a guest of Elrond and apparently he met Gildor once more again around there.

### End of the Third Age

He lived a very pleasant life of retirement in Rivendell: eating, sleeping, writing poetry, and working on his memoir, *There and Back Again* and wrote a book called *Translations from the Elvish*.

When Frodo came to Rivendell seventeen years later, they reunited in the Hall of Fire. While alone, Bilbo mentioned his old ring to Frodo, wishing to see it, but Frodo refused and a shadow fell upon the two. Bilbo briefly turned into a fleshy figure, though he quickly apologized. Shortly afterwards Bilbo finishes composing (with Aragorn; whom he calls the *Dúnadan*) the *Eärendillinwë*.

Bilbo attended the Council of Elrond, offering to take the Ring to Mount Doom.  Nevertheless, this task fell to the younger Frodo, and in farewell Bilbo gave him Sting and his old *mithril* coat, both of which served Frodo well in the struggles to come.

The War of the Ring was fought far from where Bilbo dwelt, but successfully, and in the end Frodo returned home. Because of the Ring's destruction, that prolonged his life, Bilbo started ageing again; as Arwen told to Frodo later, Bilbo started looking ancient according to his kind.

### Passage west

Two years later, however, Bilbo as a former ringbearer accompanied Frodo Baggins, Gandalf, and certain Elves to the Grey Havens, there to take ship for the West, on 29 September, . He had already celebrated his 131st birthday, becoming the oldest Hobbit in the history of Middle-earth. As a mortal, he died in the West.

While sailing west, Bilbo composed a last poem looking back on Middle-earth in farewell.

## Legacy
Already an eccentric during his life in Hobbiton, the disappearance of the "Mad Baggins"  was a long-lasting discussion around the Shire. Many speculated that he got mad and seeking adventures he found his death in a river or pool, with Gandalf being responsible for not letting him settle down. Meanwhile Frodo, knowing that he is alive and well somewhere, continued to honor Bilbo's birthday along with his, every year. or Basso Boffin) that were taken by the 'wandering-madness', either lost for ever, or returning to remain eccentric and uncommunicable.

Many years after his second "disappearance" he became a fireside-story for hobbit-children, a legendary figure who used to vanish magically and reappear with bags of treasure.

Sam Gamgee named his tenth child Bilbo after his hero.

The keepers of the Red Book who copied and translated it were unwilling to make alterations to Bilbo's own text, out of respect for the hero of old, and stuck close to it and its faults. But other later copiers of the Book, based on other notes, wrote the true account on the finding of the Ring, resulting to the two differing versions of the story.

## Etymology
Within the legendarium, "Bilbo" represents a translation of the original Hobbitish *Bilba*.

It has also been noted by Paula Marmor that bilbo is a kind of Spanish sword deriving its name from Bilbao. The element *bil* ("sword") is found in some Germanic names (such as *Bilihar*).

According to the *[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]*, a dictionary of Old English, the element *bil* refers to either a farming or military blade, significant in that it must have two edges. The element *bó*, equivalent to *bá*, means both.

## Other names
***Barrel-rider**, given by himself during his conversation with Smaug, used also by the dragon.
***Burglar**, given by Gandalf, which he wrote in Bilbo's door.
***Clue-finder**, given by himself during his conversation with Smaug. It later became the name of a favourite character of legend who would vanish with a bang and a flash, only to reappear with bags of jewels and gold.
***Mr. Lucky Number**, given by Smaug.

:Bilbo hosts an 111th birthday party at The Shire. He dines with Gandalf, Frodo, Sam and Merry. During the party, he dissapears, using The One Ring. The Narrator then recounts that Bilbo gifted Frodo the Ring as a birthday present. Later, in Rivendell, Bilbo tells of his journey and discovery of the One Ring. Bilbo tells that he discovered the curious properties of the Ring and begun to understand that it was The One. On the morning following the Council of Elrond, Bilbo gifts Frodo his sword, Sting, and his Mithril-coat, noting that it is strong enough even to deflect the knives of The Black Riders, despite its light weight. After Frodo puts it on, Bilbo remarks that he looks like a true Hobbit. Before the Fellowship of the Ring departed, Frodo and Bilbo huddle in a cloak on the stairs to conserve heat. As the Fellowship departs, Bilbo wishes them good luck.

:The voice of Bilbo Baggins is provided by Marián Labuda. Though Bilbo appears as a character in the same scenes he does in the novel's narrative, his primary role is that of an omniscient, overarching narrator of the entire series. This is portrayed as Bilbo reading from and commenting on the War of the Ring while writing new chapters in the Red Book of Westmarch. There is a slightly metafictional or postmodern tone to Bilbo's narration, as he occasionally breaks the fourth wall and addresses his nephew Frodo (and sometimes other characters from the Fellowship) directly, with Frodo or the other characters sometimes equally breaking the fourth wall and briefly responding to Bilbo. Until his journey to the Grey Havens at the end of the story, Bilbo spends almost its entirety in Rivendell (from where he narrates and writes the Red Book and notes for it). The prologue about hobbits and the events of his 111th birthday are briefly summarized by Bilbo at the start of the first episode and then the action shifts towards Frodo and Gandalf, and then to Frodo and his three hobbit companions.
