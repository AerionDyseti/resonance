# Mîm

**Mîm** was the last chieftain of the Petty-dwarves in Nargothrond before being driven out after attempting to murder Finrod in his sleep. Later, when he and his sons were among the last of the Petty-dwarves, he took Túrin and his band of outlaws, the Gaurwaith, into his house at Amon Rûdh in ransom for his life. Though he initially took a liking to Túrin, the arrival of the Elf Beleg aroused his hatred and jealousy and he betrayed them to the Orcs of Morgoth.

Mîm eventually made his way back to Nargothrond following Túrin's slaying of the dragon Glaurung where he claimed its treasures. He was soon after slain by Húrin, but in his dying breaths he cursed the treasure. Mîm's curse would go on to have significant repercussions, including bringing about the eventual ruin of Doriath during a battle in the Thousand Caves. The most renowned item to come of Mîm's cursed treasure was the Nauglamír, which would eventually bear a Silmaril.

## Biography
### Earlier years at Nargothrond

On the Narog river was a series of caves settled by the Petty-dwarves which they had named Narukuthûn. By the year 52, only a remnant led by Mîm, their chieftain, lingered there, and they aided Finrod who sought to make a strong place that would be comparable to Menegroth. They were generously rewarded by Finrod for this. Eventually Finrod had further help from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains in extending the fortress, but these Great Dwarves despised the Petty-dwarves and had no compunction in ousting them, especially when it was for great rewards. Mîm developed a special hatred for the Elves because of this. Mîm would then attempt to murder Finrod in his sleep, but this failed and he was driven out along with the rest of his people into the wild.

### Encounter with Túrin

In the year 486, Mîm and his sons, Ibun and Khîm, were out gathering in a place of many great stones, leaning or tumbled together. They may have been seeking for old treasures of a dwarf-house near these flat stones, and been carrying ingots of gold in heavy sacks which had been disguised. Unluckily, they were spotted by a band of roaming outlaws who then pursued them, with one of the outlaws, Andróg, shooting at them with his bow. While Ibun and Khîm managed to escape into the dusk, Mîm lagged behind and was seized, though he struggled and bit like a beast, wounding Andróg's hand. Andróg assumed that Mîm was either an Orc or was of Orc-kin, and should be killed. This sentiment was echoed by another outlaw, Ulrad, who felt cheated upon finding that Mîm's sack seemingly only contained roots and small stones. The leader of the outlaws, Neithan, stayed them however, and bid for Mîm to be let up and permitted to speak. At one point, Mîm theorized that if he ate some *lembas*, he would renew his youth and grow strong again. However, since he could not obtain it stealthily, he feigned sickness and begged for it from Beleg, only for the Elf to refuse. This set the seal on Mîm's hatred.

Together, Túrin and Beleg did great deeds and pushed back Morgoth's forces, but in response Morgoth sent a great many spies to locate their hideout. Mîm became aware of the presence of Orcs in the lands around Amon Rûdh, and he and his son Ibun soon became ensnared with them. Differing tales speak of this being either an intentional act by Mîm due to the hatred he bore against Beleg, or unintentional due to Ibun being captured and threatened with torture. Either way, Mîm agreed to lead Morgoth's forces to Túrin's hiding place, but on the following conditions: that he be paid the weight of iron for any Man they caught or slew, but of Túrin and Beleg in gold; for Mîm's house be left to him; for Beleg be left bound for Mîm to deal with; and for Túrin to be let go free. The emissary of Morgoth readily agreed, though with no real intention of upholding the promises, and insisted that Ibun be kept as a hostage. Mîm became afraid at this and tried to back out, but with the Orcs holding Ibun, he was obliged to guide them. after Túrin had slain Glaurung, Mîm made his way back to ruined Nargothrond. Finding the halls unguarded, he took possession of the hoard, sitting there joyfully while "fingering the gold and gems" through his hands. He also sang many "black songs of enchantment"

In the year 502, when a band of outlaws led by Húrin, who had witnessed all that had happened to Túrin due to being cursed to see with Morgoth's eyes, came to the Doors of Nargothrond, Mîm met with them, demanding to know their purpose. When Húrin refused to answer, Mîm told him of his own history and claim to the hoard, only for Húrin to vindicate Mîm as partially responsible for Túrin's fate.

However, with his dying breath, Mîm uttered a final curse on the treasure of Nargothrond. After this, Húrin's company then took the treasure to Doriath. One of the justifications the Dwarves used when claiming the treasure was that it had been taken with violence and murder from a Dwarf, even though Mîm was not in fact akin to them. In the poem, an old Dwarf takes the home of the Elves after they fall into shadow, taking over their hoard. In time, a dragon comes to take over his hoard from the Dwarf, destroying him in the process. Then comes a warrior, who slays the dragon and dies in the process. The treasure is then left abandoned.

## Etymology
- Mîm* is a Khuzdûl name with an unknown meaning, but in Gnomish, the word *mim* means "gum".

## In other versions
Note that in the published  Mîm hardly appears. His role is much expanded in the *Narn i Chîn Húrin* as published in the , and in *The Wanderings of Húrin*.

### The Book of Lost Tales
In *Turambar and the Foalókë*, Mîm is the Dwarf captain of the guards in the service of the dragon Glorund in the caves of the Rodothlim. He was left to watch Glorund's dwelling and treasury when Glorund set forth to confront Turambar.

At the suggestion of Ufedhin, Tinwelint eventually agreed to have the Dwarves of Nogrod forge items from this treasure, with the greatest of them being the Nauglafring (Nauglamír), a carcanet intended to host the Silmaril. After Tinwelint donned the Nauglafring, and the curse of Mîm fell upon him, the Dwarves then asked an outrageous price for their work; for their insolence Tinwelint instead had them whipped and sent off with a meagre reward.

There it is said that Mîm used to live near Tarn Aeluin in Dorthonion, where he had made his first work of art there during his youth: a flower with dew on it. Only once he became old did he stop and marvel at his creations, and how he had poured almost all of himself into them. To properly hoard them, Mîm then created a great intricate coffer. With his works thus well-stored, he then slept with his head upon the chest.

He awoke after some unknown amount of time to find people raiding his dwelling, setting it aflame. They took all his possessions, and chased him away, leaving him with only a sack of hand-tools and a secret knife with poisoned runes on its blade. Now old and bitter, he came to a refuge in the wild mountains where tried to begin his work anew, seeking to catch an echo of his memories before they were lost forever. Still further hostilities he encountered, having arrows shot at him when he was seen under daylight.
