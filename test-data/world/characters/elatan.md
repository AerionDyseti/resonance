# Elatan

**Elatan** was a nobleman who lived in the city of Andúnië during the early centuries of Númenor. He wedded Silmariën, the daughter and eldest child of Tar-Elendil, the fourth King of Númenor.

## Biography

Silmariën could have been the next ruling Queen of Númenor but because of the law of agnatic primogeniture, she could not take the Sceptre. However, when Elatan and Silmariën had their first child, Valandil, Tar-Elendil created the title Lord of Andúnië for his first grandson.

Elatan's descendants would figure prominently in the history of Middle-earth. After the Downfall of Númenor, Elendil, the last Lord of Andúnië, would found the Kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor. Thousands of years later, Elatan's descendant Aragorn II Elessar, would be a hero of the War of the Ring.

## Etymology

The name ***Elatan*** means "star-man" in Quenya. It came from the words **el**, meaning "star", and **atan**, meaning "man" (usually pertaining to mortal men).
