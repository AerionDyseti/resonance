# Óin

**Óin**, called **Oin** in , was a dwarf of Durin's Folk known for being a part of Thorin's Company in the Quest of Erebor.

## Biography

=== Third Age === 
Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.

Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined  Thorin's company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies and later settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

### Later years
Forty-eight years later, in TA 2989, Óin went to Moria with Balin and Ori, along with many other Dwarves, to recover the realm for the Dwarves of Durin's Folk. After Balin became Lord of Moria, according to the Book of Mazarbul, Óin was sent to look for the Upper Armories of the Third Deep, which were apparently westwards, near the Hollin Gate (the west gate out of Moria). Some five years passed, with Óin at some point re-joining Balin, before the Moria Orcs attacked. The Dwarves could not escape by the eastern gate because the Orcs held the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, so they tried to escape by the Hollin Gate. However, the water outside the door was right up to the wall, and the Watcher in the Water "took Óin".

In TA 3018, the Fellowship of the Ring (including Óin's nephew, Gimli) learned of the manner of Óin's death after Gandalf read Ori's account in the Book of Mazarbul, in Balin's tomb chamber.

## In adaptations

### In Rankin/Bass films
In the animated version of , Óin is shown near his brother, Glóin. His role is relatively minor compared to the book and has only a few lines; he is voiced by Jack DeLeon.

### In *The Hobbit* film trilogy

In Peter Jackson's , Óin is portrayed by John Callen. Although hard of hearing and requiring an ear trumpet to aid him (which is later trodden on by one of the goblins in Goblin-town), Óin is as fierce a warrior as the other members of Thorin's party and is lethally proficient with his iron-headed staff (in one scene he is shown swinging it over his head multiple times, bashing numerous goblins at once).  According to the studio release:
''"Along with his brother Glóin, Óin was a distant cousin of Thorin Oakenshield. A brave Northern Dwarf, Óin joins The Company of Thorin Oakenshield out of a sense of loyalty to his kin, and also because he has a substantial sum of money invested in the venture. Well read, with an inquiring mind, Óin was the healer among the Company, often applying an herbal salve of his own invention – which has since come to be known as 'ointment' after its maker."''

In , writer Jude Fisher added additional background information, including the fact that Óin often acts as a midwife on those rare occasions when a Dwarf woman gives birth. Rumor has it that he personally delivered his nephew, Gimli, and dropped him on his head.

Co-writer (of Peter Jackson's *The Hobbit* film trilogy) Guillermo Del Toro added Óin's ear trumpet as a pun, as Óin sounds like "they hear" in Spanish.

In , he decides to stay in Lake-town with Fíli and Kíli after the latter is poisoned by an Orc arrow during their escape from Mirkwood, remarking that his duty is to the sick. As he attempts to bring Kíli's fever down he asks Bard for some Kingsfoil, which Bard says is a weed they use to feed the pigs, prompting Bofur to go and find some. Later Tauriel treats Kíli's wound with Kingsfoil, after which Óin remarks to Fíli that he has heard of the wonders of elvish medicine and regards it as a privilege to see it in action.

#### Medical skills
Óin is portrayed as a medic to the company in the films. He is seen at different times in the films holding various bottles and jars. In these jars he supposedly keeps natural remedies and ointment (appropriately named after him). Later on in the second film he stays behind in Lake Town with an injured Kíli, having being pierced by a morgul shaft. When Thorin asks Óin to join him in coming to the Mountain, he says, "my duty lies with the wounded".

### In video games

**2008: :**
: Óin appears in an extended flashback depicting the Battle of Azanulbizar, in which he fights alongside his father and the rest of Farin's kin.
:The game took advantage of the exact wording of the Book of Mazarbul and rather than having the Watcher in the Water kill Óin outright, it took him to [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/The_Drowned_Treasury Ghân-gharâf] within the [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/The_Water-works Water-works] of Moria. There, Óin discovered the legendary Mithril axe [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Zigilburk Zigilburk] and used it to keep the Watcher in the Water at bay until he eventually succumbed to hunger. In the present day, the same happens to Bofur's grandson [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Bróin Bróin] of the [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Iron_Garrison Iron Garrison]. Bróin and Zigilburk are eventually discovered by the player, allowing the dwarves to pay proper respect to Óin's remains.
