# Farmer Cotton

**Tolman "Tom" Cotton**, also known as **Farmer Cotton**, (Third Age  – Fourth Age , aged 99 years) was a Hobbit of the Shire.

## History
Old Tom was a renowned farmer living on Bywater's South Lane. He was married to Lily Brown, and they had five children. Young Tom was the eldest, and his siblings were Rosie, Jolly, Nick and Nibs.
