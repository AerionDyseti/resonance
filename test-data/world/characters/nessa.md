# Nessa

**Nessa** (Quenya; IPA:  - "Young") was an Ainu and a Valië and was ranked the least among the Valar. She was notable for her speed, being fast "as an arrow in movement", wherefore she was called ***Nessa the Swift***.

## Biography
Nessa was the sister of Oromë. She was lithe and swift of foot, and she loved swift creatures such as deer. Deer followed her train wherever she went, even into the wild regions of Aman. Nessa could outrun the deer with great speed.

Before the destruction of the Isle of Almaren, the first dwelling of the Valar, Nessa delighted in dancing. She would often dance on the green grass of Almaren and later in Valinor on never-fading green lawns. Henceforth, as the Valar had finished with their labours in the creation of Arda, Manwë ordained a great feast on Almaren. The Valar gathered during the Spring of Arda, and it was sung that Nessa wedded Tulkas there. Her sister-in-law, Vána, wife of Oromë, robed Nessa with her flowers. Thereon, Nessa danced before the Valar upon the grass of Almaren.

The dwelling of Nessa and Tulkas was said to be full of mirth and revelry, for his warriors played and rivaled one another there in doughty feats. At times, Nessa would bear goblets of wine and cooling drinks among the champions of her husband.

After the flight of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, Nessa along with the other Valar desired ease and peace as in the ancient days of Valinor; they wished not for the rumour of Melkor nor for the murmurs of the Ñoldor to come ever again among them and disturb their happiness. As a result, most of the Valar clamored for the concealment of their land, hence the Hiding of Valinor.

## Etymology
***Nessa*** comes from the Quenya *neth* ("young").

### Other names
Two earlier names for Nessa were **Helinyetille**, the "Eyes of Heartsease", from *helin* ("violet, pansy"), and **Melesta**, from *mele* ("to love").

## Character
Nessa loved most to retire to the fair, ever-green lawns of Valinor which Oromë had cultivated from the richness of his forest glades. It was told that when Yavanna created the forests of Oromë, she had planted glades with spells so that they would always remain green and smooth. There in the lawns of Valinor, Nessa along with her maidens would dance as long as the great golden tree Laurelin was in bloom.* who was considered the "highest among the Maiar", along with Estë.
