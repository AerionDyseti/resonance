# Amandil

**Amandil** was the leader of the Faithful in Númenor and became the eighteenth and last Lord of Andúnië. His role as Lord of Andúnië and his dedication as one of the Faithful paved the way for the High Kings of Gondor and Arnor, ensuring their traditions were upheld by the Dúnedain of Middle-earth, culminating in Aragorn II Elessar. Elendil the Tall was his son, and Isildur his grandson. 

## Biography
Amandil was the son of the previous Lord of Andúnië, Númendil. In his youth, Amandil had a great friendship with Pharazôn, a relative of his father's mother, Inzilbêth.

When Pharazôn married Tar-Míriel and seized the Sceptre of Númenor, he had been corrupted by his father's counsel, and Pharazôn and Amandil became estranged. As a covert leader of the Faithful in Númenor, Amandil supported the old traditions of friendship with the Elves and reverence for the Valar, while Pharazôn followed the contrary way of the King's Men and his own will. He deprived the Lords of Andúnië of their lordship due to their support of the old King Tar-Palantir and commanded Amandil to dwell in Rómenna. He took Andúnië and made it the chief harbour of his ships but did not remove Amandil from his council or otherwise harm him.

In SA 3261, Pharazôn brought Sauron (who was disguised) to Númenor and, over the years, was deceived by Sauron's lies.

Eventually sensing the impending doom of Númenor, Amandil urged his son Elendil not to interfere in the imminent war but to expect and prepare for a forced departure from the island. He himself decided to set sail for Valinor to plead with the Valar for forgiveness and mercy for the Númenórean people, since at least a few had remained faithful.

He departed into the West either in SA 3310

## Etymology
The name ***Amandil*** means "Lover of Aman", or "Devoted to Aman", from the Quenya words *Aman*, a place name, and the suffix -(*n*)*dil*, meaning 'lover', or 'devoted to'.

## In other versions
In J.R.R. Tolkien's unfinished time-travel story *The Lost Road*, Amandil has the name *Valandil*, "God-friend", which for a high court official in the later days of Ar-Pharazôn would have been ill-favored. Tolkien's intention for changing the name is unspecified.

In another account, the character becomes another son of Amandil. Furthermore, Amandil had a younger brother called Elentir.
