# Rían

**Rían** was an Edain woman of the House of Bëor; the wife of Huor and mother of Tuor.

## Biography
Rían was the daughter of Belegund and the cousin of Morwen and was born around 450 of the First Age in probably in Ladros, Dorthonion. Rían was a gentle hearted woman and was a lover of nature, especially trees and flowers, and loved neither hunting nor war. She was also a singer and composed songs. She was only a young child during the Dagor Bragollach in FA 455, when Belegund became a companion of Barahir. Then, she was led to safety with the other women and children with Emeldir, the mother of Beren to Dor-lómin where the House of Hador dwelt. Rían's father died in FA 461.

Around FA 470, when Rían was twenty, she wedded Huor of the House of Marach, whose brother Húrin was married to Rían's cousin Morwen. They were married only two months for Huor joined the armies of the Edain in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad and was slain in combat with a poison arrow. Soon after that, Rían gave birth to a son, Tuor, and during the winter month, Rían lamented to her infant son that the Nirnaeth Arnoediad and the deeds of Men there would cause them to be shunned by both Elves and Dwarves. She them entrusted Tuor to Annael of the Sindar living in the hills Mithrim for fosterage. Afterwards, she went to the Haudh-en-Nirnaeth sometime later in FA 473 and fell into grief and despair upon seeing the horror of the losses of the battle where her husband was killed, and then laid herself on the mound and died. She was only twenty-three years old.

## Etymology
***Rían ***was a Sindarin name, thought to have meant "crowned gift", originating from the words *rî*, meaning "crown", and *ann*, meaning "gift". The ending -*an* could also have come *anna*, meaning "give" in Sindarin.
