# Gimilkhâd

**Gimilkhâd** was the younger son of Ar-Gimilzôr and father of Ar-Pharazôn.

## Biography
Gimilkhâd was considered to be a harsh man. He followed the ways of his father and opposed his brother Inziladûn who changed his name to Tar-Palantir when he became king, intending to repent the ways of his father and follow the ways of the Faithful. Therefore, Gimilkhâd became the leader of the King's Men in Númenór and preserved their ways in secret during the reign of Tar-Palantir. His son, obedient to his father's ways, usurped Tar-Palantir's daughter Míriel who by right deserved to rule as Ruling Queen, and ruled Númenór as king.

Gimilkhâd died at the age of 198, an unusually short lifespan for the House of Elros.
