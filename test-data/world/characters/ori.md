# Ori

**Ori** was a member of Thorin's Company of Dwarves and participated in the Quest of Erebor, as well as fighting in and surviving the Battle of Five Armies. He, along with his cousins Dori and Nori, were remote kinsmen of Thorin II Oakenshield.

## Biography
### Early life & Quest of Erebor

Ori lived in Thorin's hall in the northern Blue Mountains for many years, alongside his cousins: Dori and Nori. In the year TA 2941, Ori became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies in TA 2942, which he survived.

### In Erebor
Ori would then settle in Erebor, under Dáin II Ironfoot, Thorin's successor as King under the Mountain, with his surviving kin for a time, enjoying the wealth and prosperity of their newly captured home. In the years between the Quest for Erebor and the eventual expedition into Moria, Ori became versed in Elvish script, and continued to progress as a scribe.

### Final days

Ori was one of the several Dwarves that accompanied Balin to the lost Dwarf-realm within Moria in TA 2989, to begin a colony there. Though this was successful at first, the colony was overwhelmed in a long struggle with the goblins there, and was destroyed in TA 2994 when the Balrog Durin's Bane emerged. After Balin died, Ori and others lived long enough to bury him properly in a stone tomb, before perishing themselves in the last stand against Orcs, in the Chamber of Mazarbul. Ori's last moments were written in *The Book of Mazarbul*, from which Gandalf read when the Fellowship of the Ring passed by Balin's Tomb twenty-four years later. Ori's body had been left clutching the scarred and worn book.

## In adaptations

### Rankin/Bass films
In the animated version of , Ori's role is relatively minor compared to the book and is mostly silent; he is voiced by Jack DeLeon.

### *The Hobbit* film trilogy
In Peter Jackson's , Ori is played by Adam Brown, and said to be the brother of Dori and Nori. Unlike the other members of Thorin's company, Ori is a scribe rather than a warrior and begins the quest armed with only a slingshot and knife. Though he is shown to be often mothered by his brother Dori, he shows his mettle in the Company's many encounters. During the party's escape from Goblin Town, Dwalin lends Ori his warhammer which the younger Dwarf uses with surprising effectiveness, at one point desperately swinging it backwards into a Warg's head. Dwalin is seen carrying it again by the end of the film. The studio released the following statement concerning Ori:
:*"Younger brother to Nori and Dori, Ori is a talented artist, and can often be found drawing and writing in his journal. It is Ori who chronicles much of the journey through The Wild to the shores of the Long Lake and the slopes of The Lonely Mountain. Polite and well-bred, he is used to being bossed around by his older brother Dori and is usually biddable, although occasionally he can surprise his fellow companions with his courage and determination. Ori is said to be the youngest in the company."*

Despite being portrayed as the youngest of the company in Jackson's adaptation, Fíli and Kíli are actually described as the youngest by around fifty years.
