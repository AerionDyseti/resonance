# Dervorin

**Dervorin** was the son of the lord of the Ringló Vale.

## History
In the prelude of the siege of Minas Tirith on 9 March , Gondorian lords of the Outlands arrived with their troops at Minas Tirith to aid in the defence of the City. Dervorin came to Minas Tirith on foot, leading three hundred men. In addition, it is not mentioned if Dervorin went with the Army of the West to the Black Gate of Mordor and particpated in the Battle of the Morannon and if he survived the War of the Ring and returned to the Ringló Vale.

## Etymology
David Salo and Paul Strack explain that *Dervorin* is a Sindarin name of unclear meaning. According to David Salo, the first element of the name may contain *deru*, possibly from Common Eldarin **nderwā* and the root NDER, which means "manly".

:Dervorin's father, Lord Borhador of the Ringlo Vale is now very old and rarely leaves his halls in Ethring. The player first hears of Dervorin second-hand from his family, and after finding him in Minas Tirith before the attack, delivers to him the news of his home, which raises his spirit. Dervorin fights on the walls of the First Circle during the siege, managed to survive the Battle of Pelennor Fields, and proceeded to join Aragorn's march to the Black Gate.
