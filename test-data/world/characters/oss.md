# Ossë

**Ossë** (Quenya or Ñoldor; IPA: ; from the Valarin **Ošošai**, **Oššai**) was a Maia associated with Ulmo.

## Biography
Ossë was a Ainu spirit of the sea in the service of Ulmo; Uinen was his wife. He never entered the deeps of the sea as did his master, being fond of the wildness and unpredictability of tides along the coasts. He was a friend of Círdan the Shipwright. Ossë was a friend of the Teleri and Sindar of Middle-earth, and was valued as highly as the Valar by them. During the shaping of Arda, Ossë was swayed into entering the service of Melkor, who offered him the powers of Ulmo and played on his wild and sometimes violent desires. Thus, the seas suffered from wanton storms which brought great ruin to the lands. He was persuaded to stop by Uinen under Aulë's bidding, but his taste for violence never really disappeared. In later ages, mariners loved him, but did not completely trust him. He obeys the will of Mandos. 

Ossë also obstructed the work of Ulmo and Uin by dragging the island of Tol Eressëa westward, which they (possibly with the help of other animals as well) had carried to Aman. During the process, a portion of the original island fell off and became the Isle of Balar.

When Fëanor and his people perpetrated the Kinslaying at Alqualondë, Ossë, who loved the Teleri deeply, was devastated, but was forbidden by the Valar from intervening in the battle. Ossë was responsible for the raising of the island that would be called Númenor. When Ossë grew restless in the Second Age, the mariners of Númenor would call for help from Uinen to quiet his storms.

## Etymology
***Ossë*** is a Quenya word. His name in Sindarin was *Gaerys*.

## Other versions of the legendarium
In older versions of , Ossë was a Vala in his own right, and often opposed the will of Ulmo.
