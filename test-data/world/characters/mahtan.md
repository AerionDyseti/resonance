# Mahtan

**Mahtan** was a renowned Ñoldorin metallurgist of Aman and the father of Nerdanel, the wife of Fëanor.

## Biography
Mahtan was a skilled smith in Valinor who learned the arts of metal and stonework under direction of the Vala Aulë. He wore a copper circlet around his head and was known for his fondness for metal above gold. Mahtan passed on his knowledge to his eager pupil and son-in-law, Fëanor, who surpassed his teacher by becoming the greatest of all Elven craftsmen. When Fëanor and certain Ñoldor became more proud and suspicious of other Ñoldor kin due to the lies of Melkor, and began forging armaments for what would be Valinor's first war, Mahtan came to regret teaching him. Later, Nerdanel became estranged from Fëanor and retired back to Mahtan's house. The servants of Aulë counselled against joining the Revolt of the Ñoldor, and therefore Mahtan chose not to rebel, and remained in Valinor in peace forever after.

## Etymology

The name ***Mahtan*** might be from the Quenya *mahta-* ("to handle"), referring to the arts and skill of making. His devotion to Aulë had earned him the name **Aulëndur** ("Servant of Aulë") from *-ndur* ("to serve"). His alternate epessë, **Rusco**, meant "Fox", a reference to his red-brown hair.
