# Uldor

**Uldor**, also known as **Uldor the Accursed**, was an Easterling Man, and the youngest son of Ulfang the Black.

## Biography

Uldor was from one of the tribes of Easterlings who entered into the service of the Sons of Fëanor.

Serving with Caranthir since FA 457, Uldor and his brothers Ulfast and Ulwarth helped Caranthir prepare for war with Morgoth; but like the rest of his family, they were already secretly allied with him. They agreed to betray Maedhros and his forces to Morgoth in the Nírnaeth Arnoediad by sending a series of false warnings of an attack from Angband from another point. This delayed the march of the Eastern Army under Maedhros from joining the rest of the coalition in time for the main battle.

He was the leader of the treacherous Easterlings after his father's death, and attacked the Eastern Army from their rear with a hidden force of Easterlings. He was slain by Maglor, but his actions helped Morgoth win the battle.
