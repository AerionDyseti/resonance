# Gaffer Gamgee

**Hamfast Gamgee**, also known as **the Gaffer**, was a Hobbit of the Shire, and the father of Samwise Gamgee of the Fellowship of the Ring. He was the gardener of Bag End before he passed the title onto Sam.
## History

Hamfast was born in , the third son of Hobson Gamgee, who was a roper by trade. He had three siblings: Andwise Roper, May and Halfred of Overhill.

He entered the service of his relative, "Cousin Holman", and became a gardener. One of his first jobs was tending the garden of Bag End. He married Bell Goodchild, and they had six children: Hamson, Halfred, Daisy, May, Samwise and Marigold.

On 23 September, the night of the departure of Frodo and Sam, Khamûl, one of the Nazgûl rode up the lane as the elderly hobbit was taking his air, and asked about "Baggins". The Gaffer told him that he had left for Bucklebury and it's not their business to know why, and refused to leave any message. The stranger hissed, making Hamfast shudder. Soon after the Nazgûl left, Sam arrived to give Hamfast the keys to Bag End before leaving. Surprised by Sam's arrival, the Gaffer told Sam about the stranger.

When Lotho and eventually Sharkey took over the Shire, the Gaffer was evicted from Bagshot Row. After the Battle of Bywater, in which he had only a marginal role, he moved back into the newly restored Bagshot Row, the "New Row." He was looked after by the Widow Rumble, which Frodo uses to comfort Sam about moving into Bag End. After his granddaughter is born, Sam calls his father to decide upon a name. Gaffer tells him to stick with the tradition of naming hobbit-girls after flowers and Frodo gives Sam the name "Elanor". The Gaffer lived for another 7 years and died in Fourth Age 7.

His son, Sam, named his seventh child Hamfast after his father. In the King's Letter, the name (referring to Hamfast Gardner, the fourth son of Sam and Rose, not the Gaffer) is translated into Sindarin as Baravorn. 

"Gaffer" is a colloquial word for "old man". It is a contraction of "grandfather."

## In other stories
In the illustrated short story *Mr. Bliss*, there is a resident in the village named Gaffer Gamgee who struggles to listen to the discussion between Mr Binks and Sergeant Boffin about whether Mr Bliss should be locked up for failure to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named Sam.

## Inspiration
In Letter 257, J.R.R. Tolkien recounts a holiday to Lamorna Cave in the early 1930's. To amuse his sons, he named a local Gaffer Gamgee. This "curious local character" was "an old man who used to go about swapping gossip and weather-fashion and such like". The surname was chosen because it alliterated with Gaffer.

Tolkien had several encounters with actual Gamgees, however. Gamgee Tissue, a word young Ronald considered comical, was named after J. Sampson Gamgee (1828-1886), a famous Birmingham surgeon, whilst in the Black Country dialect cotton wool was referred to as "gamgee". The Gamgees were notorious surgeons - years later, Dr. Leonard Gamgee tended those war-wounded, including Lieutenant Tolkien.

## Portrayal in adaptations
- '1978: *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 film):**
:The Gaffer does not appear in the film; but is mentioned to have been thrown out as Sam looks into the Mirror of Galadriel.
**1981: *The Lord of the Rings* (1981 radio series):**
:John Church plays Gaffer Gamgee. He used a thick peasant accent for the role. He is included in early episodes including a full dramatisation of his encounter with the Nazgul. Neither Frodo or Sam learn of this exchange. He also features towards the end of the adaptation when he admonishes the returning Hobbits for wearing "ironmongery." The Gaffer also is present as the travelers discuss how Sam should use Galadriel’s gift.

**1992: *Der Herr der Ringe* (1992 German radio series):'*
:Hamfast "Gaffer" Gamgee is played by Wolfgang Reinsch.

- '2001: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*:'''
:Gaffer appears in the film's Extended Edition, where he is played by Norman Forsey. The conversation in the Ivy Bush is moved to the Green Dragon Inn, though the dialogue remains much the same. He does not appear at Sam's marriage in *The Return of the King*.

'*2002: *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring* (video game):*'
:Gaffer appears twice; at first, he drinks at the Green Dragon, but during the night, he informs Frodo of the Ringwraith that stalks the Shire. He was voiced by an uncredited Jim Piddock.

'*2007: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:*'
:Hamfast Gamgee is found working in his garden just outside Bag End. He only offers one regional Shire quest, but has more story involvement during various seasonal festivals.
