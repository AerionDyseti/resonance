AI summary: A mysterious figure in a flowing black cloak and ornate rainbow-colored mask attends a gathering at Silvercrest Manor. This noble, previously thought to be deceased, wields significant influence while concealing her true identity and dark secrets through her magical disguise.

The Masked Duchess is a mysterious figure who attends The Winners' Circle gathering at Silvercrest Manor. Her true identity is that of a noble who was previously thought to be deceased, suggesting she has much to lose if her magical disguise were to be discovered.

A striking figure in a flowing black cloak with an oily sheen, she conceals her identity behind an ornate wooden mask painted in a riot of rainbow colors.

Her presence at the gathering suggests she holds significant influence within noble circles, using the mystery of her masked persona to move freely among the upper echelons of society while hiding dark secrets.
