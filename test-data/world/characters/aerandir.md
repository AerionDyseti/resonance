# Aerandir

**Aerandir** was a faithful friend of Eärendil - one of three mariners that accompanied him on his voyages on the high seas west of Middle-earth.

## Biography

Aerandir's kindred and birthdate are unspecified, but it is assumed that he lived in Arvernien, in the Havens of Sirion.

When Eärendil resolved to sail to Aman to plead for the Valar's help, Aerandir went with him, as did Falathar and Erellont. When they reached the shores of the Blessed Realm, he and the others remained aboard while Eärendil sought the Valar. After Eärendil's embassy was complete, Eönwë, herald of Manwë, came to Aerandir and the others and set them upon another ship. Manwë then sent a great wind to blow them east back to Middle-earth.

His fate afterwards is unknown.

## Etymology

***Aerandir*** is a Sindarin word for 'Sea Wanderer'. His name should be pronounced as *eye-ran-deer.*
