# Eluréd and Elurín

**Eluréd** and **Elurín** were the twin sons of Dior Eluchîl, the Half-elven son of Beren and Lúthien, and Dior's Elven wife, Nimloth.

## Biography
Eluréd and Elurín were born in the short-lived renewed Kingdom of Doriath under their father Dior. They were named after their great-grandfather Elu Thingol, the King of Doriath. They had a younger sister named Elwing.

The boys lived peacefully with their father and mother in Menegroth until the dreaded Oath of Fëanor descended on Doriath due to Dior's failure to turn over the Silmaril under the threat of war. When the Sons of Fëanor attacked, the twins were seized by the cruel servants of Celegorm and abandoned in the forest to die. However, Maedhros, the eldest of the Sons of Fëanor, bitterly regretted this deed and sought for them in vain in the surrounding forest.

***Eluréd*** has less clear origins. The latter element *réd * may have come from the Bëorian word *rêda* ("heir").

Initially, the characters Eluréd and Elurín were not twins, and were born in FA 492. They died in FA 506, but their father Dior died six years later, in FA 511. Christopher Tolkien later corrected this mistake.
