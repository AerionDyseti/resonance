# Andróg

**Andróg** was an Adan of the First Age, part of the band of outlaws that included Túrin Turambar. He was the father of Andvír.

## Biography
Andróg was descended from the Folk of Hador and originally lived in the land of Dor-lómin. However, after slaying a woman, he was hunted and fled southward. Being an archer, he then joined Gaurwaith, a band of outlaws that hunted the forests south of the River Taeglin and was remembered as "the grimmest among them".

When Túrin first appeared among the outlaws and slew one of their men, Andróg quickly perceived both Túrin's superiority and the Curse of Morgoth that followed him. Despite this, he esteemed Túrin and became one of his closest followers. Later, Túrin spared Andróg despite his participation in Forweg's attempt to trap Larnach's daughter, and Andróg supported him in becoming the leader of the band. After Beleg was captured by the outlaws, Andróg urged them to kill him, coveting Beleg's bow, Belthronding, and showed no favor to the Elf even after his release by Túrin.

Andróg was foremost in the attempt to capture the Petty-dwarves, seizing Mîm and shooting arrows at his sons. Once again, he wished to slay Mîm immediately, despising all Dwarves, and doubted his gift of Amon Rûdh. Andróg was cursed by Mîm when it became known that his arrow slew Khîm:

Andróg obeyed, fearing the Dwarf's curse, but prophesied in reply that Mîm would "lack a bow at need ere his end". Sometime afterward, Andróg took up his bow and arrows again and was wounded by a poisoned shaft. He was healed by Beleg at Túrin's bidding but continued to mistrust the Elf. Mîm's curse, however, was not put to rest. In fact, this act made Mîm even angrier, as all Petty-dwarves hated Elves with a passion.

During the Sack of Amon Rûdh, Andróg led some of the band to the top of the hill by a secret stair he had discovered some time before. There, he fought more valiantly than any but fell mortally wounded by an arrow. His son, Andvír, however, survived the battle.
