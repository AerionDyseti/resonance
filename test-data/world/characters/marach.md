# Marach

**Marach** was an Adan and the first lord, chieftain of his people who were numerous compared to the other houses of the Edain.

## Biography

Marach and his people crossed the Blue Mountains into Beleriand during the First Age after the Bëorians and the Haladin. The House of Marach became the Third House of the Edain and later the title of that house was more commonly known as the House of Hador. The People of Marach were great in number, and Bëor described them as warlike, marching in ordered companies; and the Green Elves did not hinder their arrival in Ossiriand. The Houses of Bëor and Marach spoke a very similar language, which would eventually become the Adûnaic tongue of Númenor. When Marach heard that Bëor had come to a rich and fertile land, he moved his people down the Dwarf-Road and settled with many of his people at Estolad, and made great friendship and alliance with the House of Bëor under Baran, the elder son of Bëor. He died at very old age for Men of his time like Bëor. Marach had two sons Malach the eldest and Imlach the youngest. His grandchildren were: a grand-daughter Adanel and a grandson Magor through his son Malach, and another grandson Amlach through his other son Imlach.

After Marach's death, his elder son and heir Malach took up the rule of their people, the Marachians.
