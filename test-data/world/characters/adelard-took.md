# Adelard Took

**Adelard Took** was a Hobbit of the Shire.

## Biography

Adelard was born in TA 2928 (SR 1328) to Flambard Took and was Gerontius Took's great-grandson. Adelard had two sons, named Reginard and Everard, and three daughters whose names are not known.

Abelard visited Bag End frequently and was renowned for having a tendency to take umbrellas that didn't belong to him, including some that belonged to Bilbo. Following Bilbo's Farewell Birthday Party in TA 3001, Bilbo left Adelard an umbrella "for his VERY OWN", as he knew of Adelard's umbrella-thievery. He lived on through the War of the Ring.

Adelard Took died in FO 2, (SR 1423) aged 95.

## Etymology

***Adelard*** (lit. noble-hard) comes from a Teutonic word meaning "resolute" or "courageous".
