# Ragnor

**Ragnor** was an Edain man of Dorthonion and one of the XII Bëorings who followed Barahir in the First Age.

## Biography

After the Dagor Bragollach, Ragnor remained with Barahir and his company who refused to surrender or submit to the will of Morgoth, thus they became outlaws surviving for nearly five years. He and the others were eventually betrayed to Sauron by the unhappy Gorlim and killed at Tarn Aeluin.
