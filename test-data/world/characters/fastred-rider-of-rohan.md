:Fastred is a major character in the Rohan storyline. A great warrior, Fastred is also stubborn and rash, always seeking to revenge against the Orcs for the death of his father. When Éomer orders all people to abandon Eastemnet and move across the Entwash river, Fastred openly defies his order, keeping his family in the city and leading his riders against the raiding parties of the Mordor Orcs instead. Fastred is next met by the player in the Druadan Forest during the ride of the Rohirrim to Minas Tirith, and he later fights in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.
