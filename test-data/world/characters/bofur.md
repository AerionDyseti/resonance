# Bofur

**Bofur** was a Dwarf who lived in the late Third Age. He is best known as a companion of Bilbo Baggins, Thorin Oakenshield, and Gandalf on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug, along with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. 

## Biography

Bofur was not related to the royal House of Durin but was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm.

### Quest of Erebor

While answering Thorin Oakenshield's quest to Erebor, Bofur went to the meeting at Bag End with his brother Bombur and cousin Bifur. He accompanied Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and rest of Thorin's Company across Wilderland to the Lonely Mountain in order to reclaim the Dwarves' treasure from the dragon Smaug. Following the dragon's demise, Bofur participated in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, receiving his fourteenth share of the treasure as agreed upon. 

### Later life

Little is told of his life after the Battle of Five Armies. Glóin reported to Frodo Baggins just before the Council of Elrond that Bofur was alive and prospering in Erebor. He may have lived into the early Fourth Age, but his time of death is untold.

## In adaptations

### Rankin-Bass

Bofur was voiced by Jack DeLeon in the Rankin/Bass adaptation of *The Hobbit* and is seen next to his cousin Bifur.

### *The Hobbit* trilogy

In *The Hobbit* trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, Bofur is played by James Nesbitt. Bofur has an expanded role in the film compared to the book, serving as lookout when the company rests in the Misty Mountains and is captured by the Goblins. He gives Bilbo words of encouragement just before their capture when the latter is about to leave to return to Rivendell, wishing him good luck. However, they are captured before Bilbo can leave. At Bag End he plays a flute, rather than a clarinet as stated in the book. He carries a mattock in Peter Jackson's films.

In the films' continuity, Bofur's family were miners, and he and his cousin Bifur also dabbled in toy-making, crafting the wonderful mechanical toys that were so famous in Dale. Life in the Blue Mountains was difficult, but Bofur remains cheerfully optimistic. Bofur maintains a close but feisty relationship with his brother Bombur whom he often teases but always looks after.

The studio released the following information about Bofur before the release of *The Hobbit* trilogy:

- "Endearing and likable, Bofur has a disastrous tendency to state the obvious and blurt out things without thinking. With a love of music and a fine singing voice, Bofur delights in good food and good company and is unfailingly optimistic. Though not especially brave, he will do his best to help those in need, especially those he counts as friends. Along with his brother Bombur and his cousin Bifur, Bofur joined the Quest for the Lonely Mountain partly to seek his fortune – and partly because he was told the beer was free."*In *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*, Bofur is present at Bag End and participates in the unexpected party. Bofur later explains to Bilbo about Smaug, for which Bilbo faints afterwards, prompting Gandalf to sarcastically say "thank you, Bofur". After the company leaves Bag End, and Bilbo realizes he has forgotten his handkerchief, Bofur tosses him a wet rag, causing many of the other Dwarves to laugh. Once the company have reached Rivendell, Bofur tosses his brother Bombur a sausage, causing the bench he is sitting on to break, causing all the Dwarves to break out in laughter. When Bilbo is going to leave the company, Bofur attempts to convince him not to, however, realizing that Bilbo is truly homesick, he wishes him the best of luck. However, Bofur points out to Bilbo that Sting is glowing. Bofur can later be seen fighting Orcs, and later fighting Orcs and Wargs along with the rest of the company. He eventually escapes Azog's forces in the pine forest due to the intervention of the Great Eagles.

In *The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug*, due to excessive partying the night before, Bofur oversleeps and is left behind in Lake-town when Thorin and Company leave for the Lonely Mountain, except for Fíli and Kíli and Óin, who have stayed behind as well because Kíli has become gravely ill from a poisoned Orc arrow. In the evening, Kíli's wound grows worse and the Dwarves take refuge in Bard's home. Óin asks Bard if there is any Kingsfoil, which he knows to have healing properties. Bard says it's a weed they use to feed the pigs, so Bofur sets off to get some. Meanwhile, Bolg and a group of Orcs arrive in Lake-town, searching for Thorin. Unintentionally, Bofur leads them to Bard's home and the Orcs attack. Legolas and Tauriel arrive just in time to kill the Orcs. When Bofur returns with the Kingsfoil, Tauriel uses it to tend to Kíli's wounds as Fíli, Óin and Bofur watch.

In *The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies*, the four Dwarves are present when Smaug attacks Lake-town, after which they travel by boat to the Lonely Mountain, to re-join the rest of the company. Bofur later fights in and survives the Battle of Five Armies along with many of his kinsmen. He is last present with the rest of the company (sans the deceased Thorin, Fíli and Kíli) when Bilbo bids them farewell and heads back to the Shire with Gandalf.

Bofur is an ally card in *The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game*, by Fantasy Flight games. He belongs to the Spirit sphere and his effect allows the player to use him straight from their hand to commit to a quest.

## Trivia
- In the movie, Bofur plays the flute (as seen during the party at Bag End).
- According to *The History of The Hobbit: Mr Baggins and Return to Bag-End* by John D. Rateliff, in the never completed third revision of *The Hobbit*, Bofur, along with Bifur and Bombur were to become something like an honour-guard to Thorin. Such a change is already supported in several places of the book, including the fact that Bifur, Bofur and Bombur all arrive at Bag End at the same time as Thorin, and that they climb into the same tree as him when the company is attacked by Wargs and Goblins.
-  In *LEGO The Hobbit: The Video Game*, he can mine for loot with his pickaxe.
-  He and Bombur and Bifur are the only member of the company who are not related to the House of Durin.
