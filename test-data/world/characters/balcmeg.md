# Balcmeg

**Balcmeg** was an Orc slain by Tuor in Gondolin.

## History
Balcmeg was considered to be *"a great fighter among the Orclim"*.

During the Fall of Gondolin, Balcmeg was among those Orcs which assailed the Gondothlim alongside the Balrogs at the coming of the Drakes. Balcmeg was ultimately slain by Tuor, who hewed him asunder with his axe, Dramborleg, in the process.

## Etymology
- Balcmeg* is a Gnomish name meaning "heart of evil", being comprised of the element *Balc* ("evil, cruel").

## Other versions of the legendarium
Balcmeg never appeared within any of Tolkien's writing after "The Fall of Gondolin" in *The Book of Lost Tales*.
