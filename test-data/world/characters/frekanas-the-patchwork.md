AI summary: Frekanas, known as "The Patchwork," is a soul commander at the Ley Line Crossroads, overseeing a phalanx powered by elven souls. He has a grotesque, patchwork appearance, combining traits from various elven clans. His role involves manipulating the souls to maintain a sound that sustains Queen Nilorin's phylactery, drawing power from them while exhibiting eerie behaviors. His deeper motivations remain unknown, and he has a significant relationship with Queen Nilorin and the trapped souls he commands.

## Role/Occupation

Soul commander at the Ley Line Crossroads; oversees the phalanx powered by screaming elven souls

## Description

An elven figure that is immediately, horrifyingly wrong—patchwork. He has the stocky build of a plains elf, but stitched onto him are the pale skin and long nails of an Imitradi, the elegant ears of another clan. When he draws power from the souls he commands, light traces through the stitches holding his body together.

## Background

Frekanas commands the souls at the Ley Line Crossroads, where a crystalline tesseract channels raw power from multiple realities simultaneously. Hundreds of elven souls spiral around the structure, each one screaming the same auto-tuned note—forced to form one of the four sounds that sustain Queen Nilorin's phylactery.

He actively manipulates the souls, slicing groups apart and slamming them together into the crystal. When they vanish with a rippling of energy, he pulls that power into himself, the light tracing through his stitched seams.

## Goals/Motivations

- Maintain the phalanx's sound that sustains the Queen's phylactery
- Draw power from the souls into himself
- Unknown deeper motivations

## Relationships

- **Queen Nilorin** — Serves her by maintaining the soul-powered phalanx
- **The Trapped Souls** — Commands and harvests them for power

## Observed Behavior

- Sits at a desk near the crystalline tesseract
- Commands souls with gestures, slicing and combining groups
- Absorbs energy from the souls through his stitched body

## Notes

- His name "Frekanas" translates roughly to "The Patchwork" in Elvish
- The party observed him while infiltrating the castle but did not engage
- "This is next. Unless worse." — Callidora's assessment
- One of the four black binding scrolls may be linked to him as a phalanx captain
