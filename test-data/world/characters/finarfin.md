# Finarfin

**Finarfin** was a Ñoldorin Elf of Valinor.

He was said to be the fairest and wisest of Finwë's sons. Like all of Finwë's sons, Finarfin founded his own royal house. Uniquely among the Ñoldor, he and his descendants had golden hair inherited from his Vanyarin mother Indis, thus his house was sometimes called "*The Golden House of Finarfin*". Finarfin is regarded as one of the most powerful Elves in all of Arda.

## Biography

Finarfin was the youngest child and third son of Finwë, High-King of the Ñoldor in Aman, with his second wife Indis of the Vanyar. His elder siblings were Findis, Fingolfin, and Írimë; his elder half-brother was the infamous Ñoldorin High-prince Fëanor, son of Finwë and his first wife Míriel. In YT 1280, and he became King of the residual Ñoldor in Aman and presumably still rules from Tirion on Túna.

Finarfin took part in the War of Wrath by leading the Ñoldorin-remnant from Aman.

## Etymology
His father-name is **Arafinwë**, the "Noble-Finwë", from the Quenya *ara* ("noble, high, royal"). His amilessë (mother-name) is **Ingoldo** ("the Ñoldo").

### Other names
An Old English translation for his name was **Finred Felanop**, in which "Felanop" means "very bold".

## Descendants
Through Galadriel, he is the grandfather of Lady Celebrían of Rivendell (wife of Elrond), and consequently, the great-grandfather of her three children Elladan and Elrohir, and Arwen Undómiel, future Queen of Gondor. 

## In other versions
In earlier versions of the legendarium, Finarfin was referred as "Finrod" his son Finrod Felagund was "Inglor Felagund". As such, he appears in the first edition of  as Finrod. This was changed in later editions, but not all references to Inglor were removed. (See Gildor Inglorion)

There was an error to a character's name, wherein J.R.R. Tolkien changed Ingwiel son of Ingwë to Finarfin son of Finwë.

## Notes
1. Orodreth appears as one of Finarfin's sons in the published . In Tolkien's writings however he clearly is Angrod's son, but this was changed in *The Silmarillion* by Christopher Tolkien, which he later admitted was a mistake.
