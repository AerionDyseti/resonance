# Grimbold

**Grimbold** was a rider of Rohan, who dwelt in Grimslade. He fought in the Battles of the Fords of Isen, and fell in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.

## History
Grimbold was a valiant captain under the Second Marshal. He was instrumental in the defence of the Fords of Isen; after his Marshal Théodred fell, he managed to hold the eyot in the river until Elfhelm arrived. Soon after, the troops of Isengard left; their mission was over with the death of the Marshal.

Grimbold and his company were scattered after the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen, though most of his troops survived. When Gandalf arrived, he sent Elfhelm to protect Edoras and Grimbold to join Erkenbrand, who was making his way to the Hornburg in an attempt to lift the siege.

After the victory at Helm's Deep and the lighting of the warning beacons of Gondor, Théoden had to quickly reorganize his troops. The elderly Erkenbrand commanded the defence of Rohan, while Grimbold was elected to take over command of the muster of the Westfold based on the valour he had shown at earlier battles. At the battle, Grimbold fought on the eastern side of the Pelennor Fields, where he was slain. He was remembered in the *Song of the Mounds of Mundburg* as "doughty".

'*2003: *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*:**
:Grimbold is briefly glimpsed twice in this film. The first time is as Théoden arrives at Dunharrow and calls out to Grimbold. In this scene he appears as an elderly man in the armour of the guard of Edoras. Later on in the film as the Rohirrim arrive at the Pelennor Fields Théoden gives Grimbold orders and tells him to "Go forth and fear no darkness!". In these scenes he was played by Bruce Phillips.

**2011: *The Lord of the Rings Online*:**
:Grimbold is first met in his encampment in the Gap of Rohan, where he is concerned with slowing the inevitable advance of the Dunlendings. During the First Battle of the Fords, Grimbold fights shoulder-to-shoulder with the player for most of the day, but Grimbold is too late to save the Théodred from a mortal blow by a large Uruk, for which he blames himself. In the aftermath of the second battle of the Fords, Gandalf tasks the player with searching for Grimbold, and after a lengthy search the player eventually finds him defending the grave of the Prince at the Fords of Isen, his only wish to die defending it.
:The player does not see Grimbold again until much later, when the Rohirrim are passing through the Drúadan Forest on their way to the Minas Tirith. Grimbold perishes on the fields of Pelennor, mauled to death by a fell beast.

**2001-2020: *Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game*:*'
:Grimbold is a hero available to the Rohan faction. He wields a two-handed axe and allows the player to upgrade Warriors of Rohan to Helmingas, making them Strength 4. He is also notable for being one of only a handful of named Rohan heroes to not have the option to take a horse.
