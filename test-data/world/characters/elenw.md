# Elenwë

**Elenwë** was a Vanyarin elf, the wife of Turgon and the mother of Idril, to whom she passed on the golden hair of her kindred.

## Biography

Elenwë was probably born in Valinor sometime during its Noontide. Elenwë followed her husband Turgon to Middle-earth when his brethren resolved to join the House of Fëanor in their pursuit of Melkor and quest to regain the Silmarils. Unfortunately, she along with many others died during the crossing of Helcaraxë; Turgon almost perished trying to rescue her. It was said that her body was covered in ice and was therefore unable to be saved.

She was the only known Vanyar elf to have ever left Valinor; after her death her bloodline survived through her grandson Eärendil and great-grandsons Elrond and Elros, onward into the royal Númenor-line. Her other descendants included Arwen and her brothers Elladan and Elrohir.

## Etymology

***Elenwë*** means "Star person" in Quenya from *elen* ("star") and the prefix *-wë* ("person").

## In other versions

The earlier name for Elenwë was ***Alairë*** (later *Anairë*). However, Tolkien corrected this and made Anairë Fingolfin's spouse and Turgon's mother.
