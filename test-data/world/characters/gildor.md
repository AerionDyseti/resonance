# Gildor

**Gildor Inglorion** was a Noldorin Elf of the House of Finrod, who was one of the few Exiled Noldor in the late Third Age.

## History
Gildor was probably the son of some Inglor and one of the Exiles of the House of Finrod. He lived in or near Rivendell.

Elven Wandering Companies crossed the Shire and Gildor knew well Bilbo and Frodo Baggins when they were out in the woods. Around September , as Bilbo Baggins was leaving the Shire for Rivendell, Gildor met the hobbit as he waved them farewell in one of their camps above Woodhall. The following years he met him once more, perhaps at Rivendell.
### Meeting Frodo

In September , he led a Wandering Company of Elves of Rivendell travelling eastwards from the Emyn Beraid, where they went to see Elbereth in the *palantír* that was kept there. On the 24th, they were singing, and unknown to him their sounds drove away a Black Rider who was searching for Frodo Baggins, Samwise Gamgee and Peregrin Took on the road near the Woody End. As they passed by them, Gildor was the hindmost, and seeing Frodo he greeted him, to his surprise. Gildor initially intended that the elves bid the hobbits farewell and continue on their way, until Pippin spoke of the Black Riders pursuing them. Upon hearing this, he invited the hobbits to join them, although it was not their custom. He rejoiced after hearing Frodo's Quenya greeting and gave him the title Elf-friend.

At night they camped on a hill above Woodhall; they ate and sang, and Gildor discussed the peril that haunted the three hobbits. He sensed Frodo's fears and uncertainties about his travel to Rivendell, and was worried hearing that Gandalf had not returned as he had promised to Frodo. When Frodo asked whether he ought to wait for Gandalf, Gildor replied that the choice was Frodo's, but if he demanded counsel, then Gildor advised him not to wait but to follow Gandalf's plans, with trusty companions. However, he refused to tell him more of the nature of the mysterious Black Riders, except that they were agents of the Enemy, and deadly. He also spoke with Aragorn and sent a message to Elrond.

Two years later, on 22 September , he met the hobbits once again. He accompanied a riding of great Lords and Ladies, that planned to sail West on board the White Ship and probably he was among the Elves who sailed to the West.

## Etymology
The meaning of *Gildor* is not given, but it can be deduced as Sindarin "Star Lord", from gil ("star") and -dor ("lord, king").

The same applies to *Inglorion*, which means "Son of Inglor", from *-ion* ("son of"), leading to the genealogical discussion explained below.

## Ancestry
Gildor is one of the less prominently featured Elves, yet he seems important enough to raise questions concerning his lineage, or the identity of this character. Gildor calls himself "Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod". He also says: "*We are Exiles, and most of our kindred have long departed and we too are only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great Sea.*" This may be the case of the reference to the name "Finrod".

The name "Gildor" first appeared in the outlines of *The Lord of the Rings* in February 1938, and in Tolkien's notes of that time, "Finrod" still meant the character later known as Finarfin and his son had the older name "Inglor".

However the name *Inglor* reappeared, in Quenya form, for Finarfin (who in the earlier legendarium, was named Finrod). Finarfin's mother-name was *Ingalaurë*. If Ingalaurë is to be translated in Sindarin according to the sound-changing rules, this would become *Inglor*. Thus, the connection of Gildor to the house of Finrod/Finarfin still remains in the updated legendarium.

This all suggests that, while Gildor might have been initially intended to be Felagund's son, in the final version he may have been a member of the House of Finrod as some other descendant, or servant, not one of Finrod's sons — perhaps one of the knights of Nargothrond.

It is also possible that he was a son of a supposed "Inglor" — a character unconnected to Finrod Felagund.
