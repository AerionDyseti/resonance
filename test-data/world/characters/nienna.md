# Nienna

**Nienna** (Quenya; IPA  or  - "Weeping" or "She Who Weeps") was an Ainu, one of the Aratar and a Vala who was responsible for the mercy and grief spread across Arda. She was the sister of Mandos and Irmo and had no spouse. Her part in the Music of the Ainur was one of deep sadness, from which grief entered the world at its beginning. She had dominion over the Halls of Nienna, which were on the western edge of Valinor, looking over the sea.

## Biography

Nienna was concerned with mourning, and she pitied the suffering of others, especially the Marring of Arda by Melkor.  Yet the lesson of Nienna is not of endless grief, but rather of pity, hope, and the endurance of the spirit.

Nienna dwelt in far western Valinor near Mandos, and she seldom came to Váli-màr. Her windows looked out beyond the Walls of the Night.

During the creation of the Two Trees, she watered the mound with her tears.

The pity of Nienna is most clearly seen in her support for Melkor when he sued for the pardon of the Valar. Though she spent her time in the world mourning for the destruction he had wreaked in Arda, when he sued for release after his three ages of Captivity, Nienna spoke on his behalf.

After the Flight of the Ñoldor, Nienna mourned for the destruction of the Two Trees, and her tears brought healing, but could not heal the mortal wounds. Thus, the trees brought forth their last flower and fruit, and made into the Sun and Moon.

Gandalf was Nienna's greatest pupil among all the others who dwelt in the Halls of Nienna. She taught him pity and many other things before he was chosen as the second wizard sent to lead the people of Middle-earth into standing against Sauron.

All that is known about her appearance is that she wore a grey hood. Given that Gandalf was her greatest student, his being clothed in grey may have been a mark of respect to his teacher. 

## Etymology
- Nienna* means *weeping *or *she who weeps *in Quenya and* *comes* *from the root *nei* ("tear").

## In other versions

In earlier writings, Nienna was the sister of Manwë and Melkor, and was called "queen of shadow".

In , Nienna was called **Fui** (“night”), the Death-Goddess. In Gnomish she was ***Fuil***, the Queen of the Dark. She dwelt in halls that bore her name, Fui, and had a roof of bats' wings. She was the spouse of Vefantur Mandos; but to her husband's halls of Vê she seldom entered. She judged the humans while Mandos judged the elves. It also should be noted that in *The Book of Lost Tales,* she is a much more sinister and dark character: a dark Valar to be the bride of the 'Death-god'.

**Heskil** (Winter One) and **Núri** (One who Sighs) were her names as well. She was additionally called **Qalme-Tari** (Mistress of Death).
