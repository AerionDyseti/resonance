# Nimloth of Doriath

**Nimloth** was an Elf of Doriath during the First Age. She was the daughter of Galathil, son of Galadhon, the son of Elmo. Elmo was the brother of Olwë and Elwë, making her a kinswoman of King Thingol.

## Biography
Nimloth married Dior the Fair, her second cousin. In the few years before the death of Thingol, she lived near the waterfall of Lanthir Lamath at the base of the Blue Mountains. Her children Eluréd, Elurín and Elwing were born there.

When Thingol died, she traveled to Doriath with her husband and their children and became Queen of Doriath. She was later slain in the Kinslaying of Menegroth by the Sons of Fëanor along with her husband. Elwing escaped to the Havens of Sirion but it is unknown whether her brothers survived or not. It was tradition among the Laiquendi of Ossiriand that they were led to safety by the birds and beasts after being abandoned in the forest by the servants of Celegorm.

## Etymology

In Sindarin, the name ***Nimloth*** means "white flower", from the words *nim* ("white") and *loth* ("flower, blossom"). Her name might also mean "Pale blossom".

## In other versions
In an earlier text, Nimloth was the sister of Celeborn, rather than his niece through his brother, Galathil.
