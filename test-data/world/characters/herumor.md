## Biography

Like all Black Númenóreans, Herumor fell under the influence of the Dark Lord Sauron during the late Second Age while on Númenór. He sailed east with Fuinur and settled in the lands of Harad; the two became lords among the Haradrim.

His ultimate fate is unknown.

## Etymology
- Herumor* means "Lord of the dark" in Sindarin, from *heru* ("lord") and *mor* ("dark").
