# Thorondor

**Thorondor** (Sindarin; IPA: "Eagle Lord") was the king of the Eagles of Middle-earth during the First Age.

## Biography

Thorondor was sent by Manwë, King of the Valar, to watch over the Ñoldor after they arrived in Beleriand. The Eldar first encountered him when he helped Fingon rescue Maedhros from imprisonment from Thangorodrim, upon which he had apparently made his home for a short time. Later, Thorondor and the rest of the Great Eagles settled in the Crissaegrim. When Gondolin was built, Thorondor became the ever vigilant guardian of the city. He rescued Fingolfin's body from defilement after Morgoth killed him, giving the Dark Lord a scar on his face. He, Landroval, and Gwaihir rescued Beren and Lúthien when Angband was aroused.

When Gondolin fell, Thorondor rescued the survivors. During the War of Wrath, Thorondor and Eärendil led the Eagles in battle with the Dragons, and may have fought with Ancalagon the Black.

## Fate
In Tolkien's writings, Thorondor is not mentioned after the War of Wrath.

Speculatively, it is possible that Thorondor returned to Valinor, although his descendants remained behind, including Gwaihir. It is also possible that he never left Middle-earth, being the Lord of the Eagles during the Third Age.

## Appearance

Two of Thorondor's kin, as depicted in *The Hobbit* films

Thorondor was presumably the greatest of all the Eagles in terms of size, with his wingspan measuring at 30 fathoms (180 feet or nearly 55 meters).

## Etymology
The name ***Thorondor*** was Sindarin for "Eagle Lord", from the words *thoron* ("eagle") and *taur* ("lord, king"). The Quenya form of the same was **Sorontar**.
