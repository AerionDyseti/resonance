# Halmir

**Halmir** was an Edain Man of Brethil during the First Age.

## Biography

Halmir was the son of Haldan, and was a Chieftain of the Haladin. He was among the most famed of the Haladin, and a strong chieftain of his people. His sons were Haldir and Hundar; his daughters were Hareth and Hiril. Haldir and Hareth married into the House of Hador.

While Halmir led the Haladin, the Forest of Brethil was largely unscathed by the forces of Morgoth. He led the Woodmen north to join the fight against Thangorodrim, and he was recognized with honor by the Elves. When large numbers of Orcs began to appear, Halmir sent for the aid of Elu Thingol of Doriath. To Halmir was sent a host of the Sindar under Beleg Cúthalion, and the combined force of the Woodmen and Sindar ambushed and destroyed an orc-legion in the depths of the forest; in this way Halmir won renown. Later, when the Union of Maedhros was formed, Halmir pledged to send many men of the woods to join the muster of the Elven lords. However, Halmir died before he could lead his people to the war, and the lordship of the House of Haleth passed to Haldir, who fought in his father's stead.
