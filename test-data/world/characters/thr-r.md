# Thrór

**Thrór I** was the King of Durin's Folk, the son of Dáin I and brother of Frór and Grór, known for ruling Erebor, the Lonely Mountain. He was the father of Thráin II, whose son was Thorin II.

## Biography
In his early life, Thrór and his family lived in the dragon-plagued Ered Mithrin. In TA 2589, when their halls came under attack by Cold-drakes, his father Dáin I and younger brother Frór were both slain at their gates by a great Cold-drake, and Thrór inherited the kingship. He and his youngest brother Grór resolved to divide their folk: Thrór led a small portion of Durin's Folk to recolonize Erebor, taking the Arkenstone with him. Grór led the other portion of Durin's Folk further east to the Iron Hills where he founded his realm.

Under Thrór's leadership, Erebor prospered for over a century. Eventually, the wealth of the kingdom attracted the attention of the dragon Smaug, who flew south and assaulted and destroyed the kingdom, killing hundreds of Dwarves and driving away Thrór and his family, as well as thousands of other survivors. The majority of the survivors migrated to the Iron Hills, but some followed King Thrór, his son Thráin II, and grandson Thorin Oakenshield westward into a long, homeless wandering. They eventually settled in the hills of Dunland, and made a sufficient living there.

## In adaptations
### *The Hobbit* film trilogy

In the 2012 live-action film , Thrór is portrayed by Welsh actor Jeffrey Thomas, but has no lines (except a brief cry of "No!" when the Arkenstone falls into a roiling pile of gold during the loss of Erebor).

In that film's story line (a significant departure from Tolkien's version), as recounted by Balin, Thrór leads the Dwarves forces at the Battle of Azanulbizar, where the displaced Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain attempt to reclaim Moria and meet an army of Orcs led by Azog. However, Thrór is killed and beheaded in hand-to-hand combat with Azog, resulting in his son, Thráin II, going mad with grief and disappearing, while Thorin II Oakenshield is enraged enough to challenge the Defiler. With nothing but a sword and a small oak branch as a shield, he succeeds in partially avenging his grandfather's death by cutting off Azog's upper left arm and turning the tide of the battle.

In all three films, Thrór is partially blamed for the coming of Smaug, having become so greedy and overtaken with lust for gold that his massive hoard eventually draws the dragon to the Lonely Mountain. In deleted scenes from the , Elrond describes the gold-lust as a hereditary disease of Durin's line, and Thorin is shown worrying about whether he has inherited his grandfather's "sickness." In the , Thranduil, who has faced "the great serpents of the North", claims to have warned Thrór about the dangers of amassing so much gold, but the dwarf refused to listen; likewise, Balin warns Thorin that a "sickness" lies upon Thrór's hoard, and Balin fears it will drive Thorin mad as it did Thrór. These words come back to haunt Thorin in the , when Thorin finally sees that he has succumbed to his grandfather's sickness, before casting off his crown and rallying the Company to join the other factions in fighting against Azog's army.

#### Personality
Thrór was powerful, honorable, and proud in his own right. However, in time his love of gold had grown far too fierce and he began spending endless hours fawning over his rivers of treasure. It was this obsession and vast treasure that attracted the unwanted attention of Smaug, the greatest fire-drake of the Third Age. Like many Dwarf lords it can be presumed that he was stout in body as he was in spirit, albeit quite greedy. This greed can be attributed, no doubt, to the effects of his Ring of Power which brooded a great lust for gold within their Dwarven bearers. This greed even lead to the spurning of King Thranduil, and the eventual souring of their relationship; a source of contention was the Necklace of Girion for Thranduil which Thrór refused to return to Thranduil although years later after Battle of Five Armies, Dain Ironfoot gave the necklace to Bard the Bowman who in return restored it to Thranduil.

### Video games
In , Thrór's tragic fate is depicted in a flashback called "Nár's Tale", being the first of many hardships endured by the King's companion.
