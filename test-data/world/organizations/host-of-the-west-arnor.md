# Host of the West (Arnor)

The **Host of the West** was a combined allied force of Elves, Men, and possibly Hobbits during the Angmar conflict.

## Formation
The host composed of a vast army from Gondor (actually just a small force compared to the full might of Gondor) that arrived in a massive fleet, which hardly could find harborage, for its might filled Forlond, Harlond, and the Grey Havens.

The Northmen, proud princes of Rhovanion; riders tall and fair came with beautiful horses from the Vales of Anduin that gathered most praise when they arrived at Mithlond.

Círdan, Master of the Grey Havens, summoned all who would fight from the Elves of Lindon, as well as the remnants of the Men of Arnor. Among the forces of former Arthedain it is said that there were some Hobbits from the Shire.

## History
In , Arthedain was in danger and King Eärnil II sent his son Prince Eärnur and a massive fleet to their aid. After Arnor fell to Angmar, Prince Eärnur, in his capacity as Captain of Gondor, reached belatedly Lindon with his fleet to the aid of Arthedain.

Although it was too late, the fleet and the host it brought, seemed so massive, that there was much joy and wonder among Elves and Men. The allied host, led by Círdan and Eärnur, marched east across the river Lune to Fornost to challenge the Witch-king, while the main body of the Host's horsemen, was to pass around the hills to surprise Fornost from the north. The Witch-king was crushed at the Battle of Fornost ().

After the main part of the battle, the Host was joined by a force of Elves from Rivendell led by Glorfindel, who chased the Witch-king.
