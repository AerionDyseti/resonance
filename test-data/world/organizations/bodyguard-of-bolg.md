# Bodyguard of Bolg

The **bodyguard of Bolg** were a group of large Orcs who served as the bodyguards of Bolg of the North, son of Azog, during the Battle of Five Armies.

## History

As the battle began to drag the day on, the Orcs regrouped in the valley upon the arrival of a ravening host of Wargs, alongside the bodyguard of Bolg. These huge Orcs were armed with "*scimitars of steel*" and as the darkened sky grew into a storm, the battle seemed to be going in their favor.

Whatever happened to the bodyguard of Bolg after they were scattered by Beorn is not known. They may have possibly been killed before they could flee. If they were among those that fled, then they may have been among the many that were driven into the River Running; or among those hunted down in the marshes around the Forest River. Yet even if they were among those that fled almost as far as the Woodland Realm, then they would have either been killed, or have been drawn deep into Mirkwood and left to die there. Whether or not they met any of these fates will remain unknown regardless.
