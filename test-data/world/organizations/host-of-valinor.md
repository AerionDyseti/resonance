# Host of Valinor

__NOTOC__
The **Host of Valinor**, also known as the **Host of the West**, was a great force that crossed the Sea from Aman and defeated Morgoth in the War of Wrath, which ended the First Age.

## History
Moved by the words of Eärendil the Mariner, the Valar agreed to come to Beleriand and confront Morgoth. In FA 545, they assembled a great force led by the Maia Eönwë that consisted of Manwë and all of the Valar, the Vanyar and Ñoldor Elves of Valinor (under Ingwion and Finarfin) and a great many of the Maiar. The Teleri agreed only to provide and sail the ships bearing across the Sea but would not participate in any other way due to their bitterness over the infamous kinslaying.  

In Beleriand the Valinor host was quickly joined by the assembled Edain, Dwarves from all seven clans and the remaining Ñoldor and Sindar of Middle-earth. It was said to have been the greatest force of arms the world had ever seen, and would only be rivaled by the Great Armament of Ar-Pharazôn millennia later. 

They met the forces sent by Morgoth in Anfauglith and warred with them there for nigh on forty years, but at last were able to secure victory. As they approached the Gates of Angband, they were suddenly driven back by the assault of a fleet of great winged Dragons led by Ancalagon the Black. Eärendil came forth in Vingilot, and was joined by the Eagles led by Thorondor; they reinforced the Host of the Valar and defeated the forces of Morgoth. Ancalagon himself was slain, and destroyed the towers of Thangorodrim in his fall. Finally, the host routed all remaining foes in the pits of Angband, and captured Morgoth, effectively ending his reign in Middle-earth.

This Host was prophesied to assemble once more for the Dagor Dagorath at the end of days (after Morgoth's return from behind the Door of Night), in which they would be victorious.
