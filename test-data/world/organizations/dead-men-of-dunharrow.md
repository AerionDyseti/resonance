# Dead Men of Dunharrow

__NOTOC__

The **Dead Men of Dunharrow**, known originally as the **Men of the Mountains**, were Men of the White Mountains cursed to remain in Middle-earth by Isildur, after they abandoned their oath to aid him in the War of the Last Alliance. They haunted the caverns beneath the Dwimorberg, and the valley of Harrowdale that lay in its shadow, though they were said to appear in the valley only in times of trouble or death. They were led by the King of the Dead. Since the line of Isildur was thought in the late Third Age to have ended, no one could call upon these Dead Men for aid, as they would only answer to an Heir of Isildur.

## History
### First Age

The Dead Men of Dunharrow were descended from the second host of the Edain that reached the White Mountains along with the Drúedain. Thus, they were close relatives of the House of Haleth that lived in Beleriand while they themselves stayed in the eastern regions of Middle-earth that would be later settled by the Númenóreans.

### Second Age
The Men of the Mountains were scattered communities of forest-dwellers without central leadership. They lived in the White Mountains during the Second Age and spoke a pre-Númenórean language that was related to Dunlendish and the Halethian language. They had worshipped Sauron in the Dark Years before the foundation of Gondor.

When Gondor was founded, they swore an oath to Isildur that they would fight for him. However, during the dark years, they had worshiped Sauron, and so when the time came and Isildur asked for their aid, they refused. And so Isildur cursed them, saying: "Thou shalt be the last king, and if the west prove mightier than thy Black Master, this curse I lay upon thee and thy folk; to rest never until your oath is fulfilled. For this war will last through years uncounted, and you shall be summoned once again ere the end." Therefore, they fled from the wrath of Isildur and dared not go forth to war for Sauron, and they hid in secret places in the mountains and had no dealings with other men. They slowly started to dwindle and the terror of the Sleepless Dead came about to all the places where they lingered.

Malbeth the Seer prophesied that a day would come when need and haste would drive one of Isildur's heirs to take the Road under the Mountain, and that the Dead would answer to his call. The Prophecy came true when, in the War of the Ring, Isildur's Heir, Aragorn, called on the Dead Men. Summoning them to the Stone of Erech, Aragorn commanded them to fulfill their oath and be free.

Aragorn led the Dead Men through Lamedon. As they went through the lands of Gondor, they found them deserted, since everyone who hadn't gone to war fled the approach of the dreaded King of the Dead. Even the Men of Umbar and Harad, who had been attacking the fords at Linhir above the mouth of the river Gilrain, stopped fighting and ran off in terror. The only person who had the courage to stay was Angbor, the Lord of Lamedon, and Aragorn told him to gather his men and follow the Grey Company to Pelargir. For four days and nights after Aragorn first summoned the dead to the Stone of Erech, they rode.

On the fifth day, they reached Pelargir, where the Corsair fleet of Umbar was assembled. Rumors of the Army of the Dead had already reached the city, but the Corsairs there turned at bay and laughed, seeing only Aragorn and his host of live Dúnedain warriors. Aragorn then called to the Army of the Dead to fight, and they emerged, driving the Corsairs away from their ships. Legolas, after the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, later described the scene he witnessed to Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took: "Faint cries I heard, and dim horns blowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it was like the echo of some forgotten battle in the Dark Years long ago. Pale swords were drawn; but I know not whether their blades would still bite, for the Dead needed no longer any weapon but fear." Despite not needing weapons, the weapons of the Enemy could not harm them. Once the Haradrim and Corsairs were defeated, Aragorn had trumpets sounded and the Dead withdrew to the shore. As they had at last fulfilled their oath, Aragorn granted the Dead Men their freedom. The King of the Dead stepped forward, broke and discarded his spear; he bowed to Aragorn, and with his people vanished at last from the world.

## Other names
The Dead Men of Dunharrow were known as the Men of the Mountains before breaking their oath. Afterwards, they were referred to as the **Sleepless Dead**, the **Grey Host**, the **Shadow Host**, the **Shadow-men**, or simply the **Dead** and the **Shadows**.

In adaptations such as the The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, they are named the **Army of the Dead**.
## Inspiration
Northern European folklore tells of 'the restless dead' as fell riders bursting upon unwary travellers in lonely places. Horses, knights, hounds are among the restless spirits in the "Wild Hunt". Hans Sachs' poem, "Das wütend Heer der kleinen Dieb" (1539) describes the furious host in gruesome detail, accompanied by ravens who plucked out the eyes of the roving dead: "there came one behind, who had been hanged the same day, had still his eyes and saw me."

It is an indication of Aragorn's heroic nature and lineage that he dares summon the dead to fulfill their oath in this manner, and a sign that the rightful king has indeed returned.

## In adaptations
### *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King*

In the  of Peter Jackson's film trilogy, the battle with the Corsairs occurs off-screen (part of it is shown in the extended edition) and the Army of the Dead accompany Aragorn to Minas Tirith, replacing the Grey Company, to defeat Sauron's Orcs, after which Aragorn declares their curse lifted. Legolas correctly states that it was Isildur who cursed them, but incorrectly states that he was "the last king of Gondor". (Isildur was the last high king of Gondor and Arnor, after which the two kingdoms divided and would both eventually be left kingless until Aragorn took the throne.)

:*"There are those who dwell in the mountain."*
:*"Murderers, traitors, you would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing, they answer to no-one."*
:*"They will answer to the King of Gondor."*
::- Elrond and Aragorn talking of the army of the dead.

The dead army does not go to the Stone of Erech, but instead, Aragorn confronts them in front of what appears to be their city. The Dead appear as green and glowing, and are more reluctant to fulfill their oath; the King even swings at Aragorn with his sword. While the books make no mention of anything being able to harm the Dead, in the film, the King's own sword is contacted and blocked by Aragorn’s sword Andúril (Narsil reforged).

### Video games

#### *The Return of the King* video game
In  video game, the dead army glows a more blue color, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are all able to harm them. Two levels feature the dead army, one the Paths of the dead where Aragorn and his companions fight their way through the paths of the dead, and the other the King of the dead where Aragorn fights the dead king. After the Dead king is defeated by Aragorn, he and his friends must escape from the paths of the dead. The dead army appears one more time in the game at the end of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields to help save Minas Tirith from the Morgul-host. In addition to the Return of the King video game storyline, soldiers of the dead army also appear in the Palantir of Saruman bonus level, in which the player must defeat 20 waves of enemies in an arena; about half of those enemies are dead soldiers.

#### *The Battle for Middle-earth I* and *II*

The Army of the Dead is summonable in all , being the most expensive Power for Gondor and Rohan in the . The Army of the Dead fullfilled the role of the superweapon for the force of Man, they can destroy vast armies alone, gliding through any types of units while seemingly sap the life of them at a rapid rate while being nigh-invincible against retaliatory attack. However they lasts for only two minutes and deals little to no damage to buildings. Certain entity of vast magical power such as Sauron, Summoned Dragon or similar can actually hurt them. In , they are only available in Skirmishes and the Evil Campaign, in which the player must move the forces of Evil to destroy all the Dead soldiers and the Fellowship at Rivendell. Apart from being a 25-point faction power, Aragorn, when at level 10, can summon one temporary horde of Oathbreakers.

#### *The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age*
In , the player has the opportunity to summon the Army of the Dead through Aragorn in the later stages of the final Map location, Pelennor Fields. This skill costs 255 AP to use, but with Aragorn's abundant supply of 3000 Max AP, it is definitely worth it. When this power is activated, the Dead mobilize behind Aragorn and charge forth at the enemy. Led by the King of the Dead, the Dead army can do any range of extreme damage from 25000 (Nazgûl) to 50000, and they usually kill any unit apart from Nazgûl and Trolls. This is arguably the best move in the entire game, including Perfect Mode moves.

#### *The Lord of the Rings: Conquest*
In , Aragorn's special heavy attack is "Wave of Undead", with which he summons several Dead Men to attack an enemy for a very brief time.
