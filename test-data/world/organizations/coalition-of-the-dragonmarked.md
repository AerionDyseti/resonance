## Overview

The Coalition of the Dragonmarked was a multinational alliance of armies from across Enym, united under the leadership of the previous generation of dragonmarked heroes during the **Darkness Wars**. Their symbol—a modified version of Sol's holy symbol—marked their armor, equipment, and documents.

## Formation

When the Darkness Wars threatened to consume Enym, the dragonmarked heroes of that era rallied disparate nations and peoples to stand together against the encroaching shadow. Their supernatural abilities and heroic reputations allowed them to inspire and coordinate forces that would otherwise never have fought side by side.

## Symbol

The Coalition used a modified symbol of Sol as their identifying mark. This symbol has been found on:

- The armor of fallen Coalition soldiers in the ancient cistern
- A journal recovered from the oasis dungeon
- A +1 quickdraw shield recovered by the Keys to Perfection party

## Legacy

The Coalition achieved victory in the Darkness Wars, though the cost was immense. Many of their soldiers—like the Hyrian warriors found in the ancient cistern—never returned home. Their equipment and remains are occasionally discovered in locations where battles were fought or where soldiers fell during missions.

## Current Status

The Coalition disbanded after the Darkness Wars ended. However, their symbol and legacy endure, and artifacts bearing their mark continue to surface across Enym.

## Known Members

- The dragonmarked heroes of the previous generation (specific names unknown)
- Hyrian soldiers, including Hinandyr barbarians
- Forces from multiple nations across Enym

## Encounters

The Keys to Perfection party discovered Coalition remains and equipment in the ancient cistern beneath the Solaar Desert oasis, including two Hyrian warriors who had been on a mission to transport a powerful (now cursed) spear.
