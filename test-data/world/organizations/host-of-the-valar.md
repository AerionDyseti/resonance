# Host of the Valar

The **host of the Valar**, also called the **Host of Valinor**, was the mighty army that overthrew Morgoth and his legions at the end of the First Age.

The army itself was composed of Eönwë, the herald of Manwë; possibly other Maiar and some of the Valar; the Noldor of Valinor under Finarfin; and the Vanyar under Ingwion.

They were brought to Middle-earth by the ships of Falmari, who took pity on the words of Elwing; however the Falmari refused to fight beside the Noldor, remembering the First Kinslaying. Once they landed, the Host of the Valar drove away the Orcs of the shores of the Belegaer in the Battle of Eglarest.

The Host of the West met Morgoth's host of the North in the titanic clash of the War of Wrath. Assisted by the Great Eagles and Earendil, they were victorious.
