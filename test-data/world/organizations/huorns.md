# Huorns

**Huorns** were large and wild tree-like creatures which could move and use speech, whom the Ents cared for and tended to in the Second and Third Ages. They were a half "awoken" race, being more sapient than trees, but not fully sentient like Ents.

In Middle-earth, they were known to dwell in Fangorn Forest and possibly the Old Forest.

## History

The origin of the Huorns is unknown. It is not clear if Huorns were Ents that had become tree-like, or trees that had become Entish. Perhaps both varieties existed, though the Hobbit Meriadoc Brandybuck believed the former was true. In either case, Huorns were probably a transitional creature part way between trees and Ents.

In the Third Age, the Huorns lived in Fangorn Forest, After Isengard was emptied of its Orcs, the Ents directed the Huorns to help the Rohirrim at the Hornburg in their battle. While at Helm's Deep, the Huorns defeated every one of the Orcs fleeing the battle. Afterwards, they then gathered all the Orc carcasses and buried them in the Death Down before going back into the forests. It is likely comprised of the elements *hū* ("spirit, shadow") and *orn* ("a tall tree"). It may also be related to the root *KHUG* ("bark, bay"). Carl F. Hostetter also suggested that it means "talking tree" in Quenya, assuming that it is related to the root *KHOL* ("crow, cry aloud"). Mark Fisher theorized that the word is connected to *hûr* ("active") and *hû* ("dog").
