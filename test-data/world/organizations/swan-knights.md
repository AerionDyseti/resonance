# Swan-knights

The **swan-knights** of Dol Amroth were a group of soldiers who served Prince Imrahil during the Third Age of Middle-earth.

## History
On March 9, 3019, Prince Imrahil led a company of swan-knights to Minas Tirith to help defend the City. Prince Imrahil led the sortie that rode to the aid of Faramir and the rear-guard who were retreating from Osgiliath when the forces of Sauron overran the Pelennor Fields on March 13. Shortly thereafter, the swan-knights rode to the aid of the Rohirrim, fighting long and hard until the arrival of Aragorn.

## In adaptations
The swan-knights of Dol Amroth appear in the popular strategy game *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king*, as the "hero-horde" units of the faction of Men.
