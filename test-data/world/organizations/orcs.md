# Orcs

**Orcs** were the primary soldiers of both Dark Lords' armies, and their most common servants. Invented by Morgoth during the Years of the Trees of the First Age, they served him and later his successor, Sauron, in their aims to dominate Middle-earth. It was believed by the Eldar that before Oromë first discovered Cuiviénen, Morgoth had kidnapped some of them and cruelly deformed them, twisting them into the first Orcs.

After the Battle of the Powers, many Orcs alongside other servants of Melkor survived in the deep caves, pits,  chambers, and tunnels of Melkor's underground fortress, Angband. They multiplied there and later spread through northern Middle-earth. They were first seen by the Dwarves who reported them to Thingol, King of Doriath, causing the latter to seek weapons of war for the first time. From that time forward, Orcs would be present in almost all scenes of war and strife in Beleriand, and in Middle-earth after the First Age until Mordor was destroyed.

Orcs referred to themselves in the Black Speech with the term ***Uruk***, which generally referred to the strongest of their kind, such as the Uruk-hai and Uruks of Mordor.

## History

### First Age

It is not known with certainty how the Orcs came to be. Melkor was the first to learn of the Awakening of the Elves at Cuiviénen, and soon began sending evil spirits among them, who planted seeds of doubt against the Valar. It is rumoured that some of these Elves were being captured by a "Rider" if they strayed too far, and it was believed by the Eldar that these unfortunate Elves were brought to Utumno, where they were cruelly tortured and twisted into Orcs.

In the last six centuries of the First Age, thousands of Orcs were bred in Angband by Morgoth and to participate in the Battles of Beleriand, which began after the Ñoldor arrived to north-western Middle-earth. They first appeared in the Battle of the Lammoth, where they were defeated by the Elves. When the House of Fëanor returned to Middle-earth Morgoth sent a force of Orcs against them. Although the Orcs outnumbered the exiles they were no match for the power and wrath of the Ñoldor, and were quickly and easily defeated. However, Fëanor could not defeat the power of Morgoth alone and he was killed by Balrogs, leaving the Orcs to continue to breed under the Dark Lord. Years later, when the House of Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth, Orcs were sent against them as well, but they were utterly defeated in the Battle of the Lammoth.

After their crushing defeat in the Dagor Aglareb and in a minor raid on Hithlum, the Orcs nevertheless regained their numbers. In the Dagor Bragollach and Nírnaeth Arnoediad, they and their master won crushing victories against the free peoples. However, they were nearly destroyed in the War of Wrath that ended in FA 585, and those that survived fled eastwards into the Mountains of Angmar, Grey Mountains, or Red Mountains.

### Second Age
Sometime around SA 1000, Sauron reappeared in Middle-earth and made the land of Mordor his realm, and then started to build the foundations of Barad-dûr. During the War of the Elves and Sauron in SA 1700, the Orcs formed the main host of Sauron's power. Despite the immeasurable number of Orcs present, the battle was won by the Elves and the Númenóreans due to their united force, superior weaponry, greater strength and stature and combat skill.

However, Sauron had not been able to gather all the Eastern Orcs into his armies, as they at first scorned him, seeing only his fair form. It was after his first defeat that Sauron went back among them, in a dark guise, and subdued them, and was able to begin rebuilding his power.

Until Sauron's final downfall in the Third Age, Orcs remained the backbone of the armies of Mordor, and of Isengard while the wizard Saruman ruled it.

### Third Age
After the War of the Last Alliance Mordor was desolate and the surviving Orcs were concentrated in the Misty Mountains. With the return of Sauron to Dol Guldur and the spread of his evil influence, their numbers began to increase once more. In TA 2475 at the ending of the Watchful Peace, a new tougher, stronger breed of Orc appeared; the Uruk-hai, specifically bred for fighting Men.

Following the abandonment of Khazad-dûm by the Dwarves, Orcs eventually colonised the abandoned halls, killing King Thrór when he sought to enter his lost realm. This triggered the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, a massive conflict where the Dwarves gathered their full strength and destroyed every Orc-hold they could find in the Misty Mountains. This and the Battle of Five Armies greatly reduced the numbers of Northern Orcs, weakening their contribution to the War of the Ring.

In the meantime Sauron had returned to Mordor, rebuilding his fortress and creating a vast army of Orcs. He bred a huge breed of Orcs-soldiers with great strength, the Uruk-hai, some time before TA 2475, when they creatures first appeared from Mordor ravaging Ithilien and Osgiliath. Later, some of these Orcs populated the Misty Mountains and subdued local Orkish tribes. Sauron's pawn, Saruman the Wizard, also bred those Uruk-hai, who descended from the Hithaeglir and served him as mercenaries; he also experimented on cross-breeding of Orcs and Men, producing Half-Orcs even taller than Uruk-hai.

Following the destruction of the One Ring, the Orcs scattered, eventually dwindling and being hunted to extinction (or near-extinction levels) in the Fourth Age.

## Characteristics

In J.R.R. Tolkien's writings, Orcs were cruel, sadistic, black-hearted, vicious, and hateful of most things, particularly of those who were orderly and prosperous. They were short in stature (unless of the Uruk-hai variety) and humanoid in shape. They were generally squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, bow-legged, with wide mouths and slant eyes, long arms, dark skin, and fangs (this description has become controversial, as Tolkien noted Orcs would appear to Europeans as "least-lovely Mongol types", and based the Uruk-hai on (what is now considered) a xenophobic depiction of the Huns from a Roman historian's perspective, so certain traits such as "slant-eyed" and having dark skin are more viewed today as racist depictions of Orcs characteristic to racial stereotypes of Tolkien's time). Tolkien describes one "huge Orc chieftain" as "almost Man-high", and some must have been close to Hobbit height, as Sam and Frodo were able to disguise themselves as Orcs in Mordor. They were roughly humanoid in shape with pointed ears, sharpened teeth and grimy skin. Their appearance was considered revolting by most of the other races. Most Orcs did not live long, as they were viewed as expendable by the Dark Lords; however, in peacetime, certain Orcs such as Azog and Bolg lived for well over a century, so it is likely they lived quite long when not being ruled by the Dark Lords.

Orcs made no beautiful things, but many clever ones including machines, tools, weapons, and instruments of torture. They were delighted by wheels, engines, and explosions, and could tunnel and mine as well as any but the most skilled Dwarves, though they are often untidy and dirty.

Wickedness and violence were their nature, and it was not uncommon for them to kill each other in petty quarrels. They had a destructive effect on nature, especially forests, and often destroyed trees to fuel their war-making, particularly those near Isengard. Orcs had unchangeable disdain for all Elves, Dwarves, and Men, though they fought alongside wicked men under Morgoth and then Sauron in the First, Second, and Third Ages and were also said to have made alliances with wicked Dwarves.
## Etymology
In Tolkien's Sindarin language, ***Orc*** is *orch*, plural *yrch*. In his late, post-*Lord of the Rings* writings (published in ), he preferred the spelling "Ork", evidently mainly to avoid the form *Orcish*, which would be naturally pronounced with the *c* as /s/ instead of /k/. (In Tolkien's languages the letter *c* was always pronounced /k/.) It is also possible that the word is a Common Tongue Version of 'orch', the Sindarin word for Orc. The original sense of the word seems to be "bogey", "bogeyman", that is, something that provokes fear, as seen in the Quenya cognate *urko*, pl. *urqui*. In Old English, *Orc* means "demon."

The term *Uruk-hai* merely means "orc-folk" in the Black Speech, and was the Uruk-hai's name for themselves.

### Other names
***Glamhoth*** was a Sindarin word for Orcs that meant 'din-horde'.

***Gorgûn*** was the name that the wild men of the Drúadan Forest used for Orcs in their own language. Although is was also the name of an orc in specific.

***Yrch*** was the term used by Haldir and his brothers, who were Elves of Lothlórien. This same word was also used by Legolas, indicating that it was either Sindarin or Silvan Elvish in origin.

Uruk was the term used by Orcs in general, which referred to their race overall and their stronger kin in their own language (Black Speech).

## Terminology

Tolkien explained in a note at the start of *The Hobbit* that he was using English to represent the languages used by the characters, and that *goblin* (or *hobgoblin* for the larger kind) was the English translation he was using for the word *Orc*, the hobbits' form of the name. Tolkien used the term *goblin* extensively in *The Hobbit*, and also occasionally in , as when the Uruk-hai of Isengard are first described: "four goblin-soldiers of greater stature".

A clear illustration that Tolkien considered Goblins and Orcs to be the same thing, the former word merely being the English translation of the latter is that in *The Hobbit* (the only one of Tolkien's works in which he usually refers to Orcs as *goblins*), Gandalf asks Thorin if he remembers Azog the Goblin who killed his grandfather Thrór, while in all his other writings Tolkien describes Azog as a "great Orc".

In , Tolkien mentions Orcs as a large variety of Goblins, leading some to the notion that the Northern Orcs of the Misty Mountains were of smaller build than average Orcs, although the "Great Goblin" and "Azog the Goblin" (as he was called in ) were massive in size. Tolkien also described Goblins as big, ugly creatures, "cruel, wicked, and bad-hearted."

## Quotes about Orcs

## In other writings
Goblins appear in some of Tolkien's other writings outside of the legendarium. For example, in , they were enemies of  and of Red Gnomes, Green Elves, and Snow Elves. In this account, Goblins used a pictographic writing system.

## In adaptations
### Films
#### *The Hobbit* (1977 animated film)
In , the Orcs are called Goblins and have a more bloated and squat appearance compared to other adaptations plus they tend to have horns.

#### *The Lord of the Rings* (1978 animated film)
In , the Orcs are voiced by extras. They are all humanoid beings with red eyes and many inhuman features; there doesn't seem to be much variation among them outside of three types. 

The first and most prominent type is distinguished by their clawed hands and feet, fangs, black body hair, feline cheeks, and potentially green skin. In addition, they are quite broad-shouldered and have a stooped posture. Their attire is mostly consistent: many wear robes resembling togas and double-horned helms similar to Viking helmets; a few members of Uglúk's group seem to be wearing jet-black body suits instead of togas (and these ones tend to be skinnier than the rest); further still, at least two Orcs (seen both at Moria and as a part of Uglúk's group) wear very scaly armor and are shorter than the rest.

Another less-common Orc type has more apelike features, including large mouths, thick teeth, heavy brows, long faces with flat noses, and a lot of head hair; they stand tall, lack claws, and wear robe-like tunics and no headgear. They appear after Merry and Pippin are captured and are extensively featured throughout the Battle of Helm's Deep.

Finally, a third type is observed, faintly resembling the previous two but wearing tunics and head-bandages that reveal nothing but their eyes and noses (though, at least one can be seen with fangs). They are the least prominent variety, appearing until after Merry and Pippin are captured.

#### *The Return of the King* (1980 animated film)
In , the Orcs are voiced by Paul Frees. They resemble the Goblins seen in , but have grey skin and are generally more thin.

#### Peter Jackson's films
In Peter Jackson's two film trilogies, Orcs range greatly in appearance. Skin colour ranges from bone white (Azog and Bolg) to peachy colours (Orcs like the lieutenant Gothmog in ), to shades of green. Most Orcs however are shown as having darker shades of black or brown skin. Some are more human-like than others; Azog looks like a large and muscular but pale and hairless human, whilst Gothmog has a very deformed face. In general the Orcs tend to be shorter than most men. Some Orcs shown are particularly slack with poor posture and broad with long arms, a shape represented best in Grishnákh's portrayal in ; others, such as all Uruks, have a human posture. A new rendition of Orcs was introduced in : short mutated creatures covered in dubious warts and unidentified growths. They have pallid pinkish-white skin, large heads, and bat-like or porcine facial features.

The clothing and armour worn by Orcs in the films vary greatly. The Orcs wear an assortment of different styles of armour and clothing and also commonly have various piercings and tribal scars. Other Orcs wear specifically designed and made uniform armour for battle. They are often bald or are balding, while others have long, coarse hair. Their hair is most often dark or greying in colour, but in *The Return of the King* some Orcs with blond hair and beards are seen marching from Minas Morgul.

#### *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*
Orcs are featured throughout , often being antagonists in many encounters. In the show, Orcs refer to themselves as "Uruks" and prefer to be called "Uruk".

Their closer portrayal in the series compared to in previous adaptations (e.g. Adar and his followers who had renounced their loyalty to both Morgoth and his successor Sauron, and the revelation of Glûg having a wife and child he deeply cherished) has stirred controversy among fans, as with other changes.

Ironically, this was something Tolkien was also troubles by as the notion of Orcs being evil as a race contradicted his Catholic upbringing which influenced his works.

Orcs in the Rings of Power are generally less "developed", having emerged from the War of Wrath, and are presumably descended from the elves corrupted and tortured into becoming the first Orcs. After the War of Wrath, they are gathered by Sauron, who wants to become the next Dark Lord, and experiments cruelly on Orcs in the fortress of Durnost in Forodwaith during the early Second Age. These experiments alienate Adar, who hates Sauron further when Sauron gives a lengthy speech to the Orcs on his coronation, telling them they have no choice but to follow him, since their race is hated by everyone else, and after an Orc tries to assasinate him, cruelly stabs the Orc in the eye multiple times. This prompts Adar, who is trusted with crowning Sauron, to stab Sauron in the back with his crown, and the Orcs help Adar "kill" Sauron, hailing Adar as their new leader; after this, they travel to the Southlands, enduring many hardships. 

Upon reaching the Southlands, Orc-holds are established, with Adar and his followers building tunnels and enslaving Elves and Southlanders to build tunnels above ground; many Uruks of the Southlands help capture Arondir and others, and were injured or slain when Arondir led a failed revolt; these Uruks later hailed Adar as he approached them, and were noted to speak of him with reverence. During the Battle of Ostirith, many Uruks were injured; after the Battle of Tirharad, Uruks happily chanted "Udun" as Mordor was brought into being.  

During Adar's rule of Mordor, many Uruks/Orcs helped him enslave and brand (or kill) the remaining Southlanders in Mordor. The legions of Orcs/Uruks are later led out of Mordor by Adar, who hears from Halbrand (Sauron in disguise) that Sauron is alive and seeking to enslave the "children" of Adar again.  

Adar, after getting the proof   from a captive Galadriel that Sauron is Halbrand, and is in Eregion, leads the Uruks/Orcs to war against Eregion.  However, as Adar makes decisions that are rash and lead to the deaths of many Uruks, while showing less concern due to his desire to defeat Sauron to free the Uruks from his potential control, many Uruks led by his right-hand, Glug, begin opposing Adar. When Glug and his soldiers encounter Sauron later during the siege of Eregion, they submit to Sauron, and stab Adar to death, hailing Sauron as their new "Dark Lord"; the Uruks/Orcs who did not betray Adar, upon hearing an Uruk/Orc referring to "Lord Sauron", are forced to submit to him as well. However, the Orcs/Uruks retreat after Dwarves reinforce Eregion, but are forced back into war by Sauron, who kills Glug sadistically for reporting to him that many Orcs/Uruks will die if they continue fighting.

### Video games
#### *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth*
Orcs appear in both the Mordor and Isengard factions of  (2004). In the Mordor faction they comprise basic infantry and archer units, and operate siege weapons such as the Battering Ram and Catapult. In the Isengard faction, Orcs are far fewer in comparison to the Uruk-hai, serving as the faction's calvary units (Warg Riders) and laborers. Goblins would appear as neutral evil enemies.

#### *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II*
Orcs within the Mordor and Isengard faction largely retain their prominence and roles in  (2006), along with the introduction of Orc builder units for all the evil factions. Two new evil factions would also be introduced: Goblins and Angmar. The latter being introduced in the  expansion.

Formerly a neutral evil enemy encountered in the first game, Goblins return as a fully-fledged faction and would retain their appearance drawn from their portrayal in Peter Jackson's , such as their crude weapons and armor, hunched postures, smaller statures, and large eyes. The Goblins specialize in fast-paced shock-and-awe tactics, as their basic units (though weak) are highly mobile, inexpensive, and can quickly traverse the map (even able to climb walls) and threaten an unprepared opponent. A baseline Orc would also serve as the Goblins' builder unit.

The Angmar faction would have Orcs of Gundabad within their ranks, serving as the faction's builders, basic infantry, and its only true calvary in the form of its Wolf Riders. These units would complement Angmar's more expensive and advanced units.

#### *Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor*
Orc culture is largely expanded through the use of 's (2014) Nemesis System, wherein Orcs serve as the primary enemies but the player-character Talion must take advantage of their cultural hierarchy to oppose Sauron's armies. 

Orcs range in height and body type from smaller and hunched over to taller and muscular, or medium height and rounder, with skin-colors that are mainly in hues of green. Orc Captains lead grunts, and usually have titles that describe their personality or some feat they have accomplished. These titles may also change to reflect their change in status, great victories or defeats. Orcs are also shown to have more nuanced personalities, they have fears that can be exploited and cause them to retreat, or they may become enraged and fight harder, others even have the trait to mercifully spare their opponents, or humiliate them without finishing off a downed opponent.  They may form rivalries with other Orc's, Talion can even form alliances with a small number of them. At the heart of the Orc social hierarchy is the infighting amongst them as they seek to climb the ranks, something that Talion can seek to exploit. The leader of the Orcs in the regions of Udun and Nurn are the Warchief, who may travel with bodyguard subordinates. Partway through Talion gains the ability to 'Dominate' Orcs by instilling enough fear in them that they defect from Saurons forces. A key component of the Nemesis system is the ability for slain Uruk's to come back upon defeat, either due to their hardy bodies healing or the use of powerful Orcish medicine. The Orcs love of the alcoholic drink Grog is also showcased, something that can be weaponized against them via poison or its explosive nature. 

A later DLC campaign showcases the Orcs attempt to tame the local wildlife of Mordor into their armies, with some Orcs even treating them compassionately as pets. This foreshadows the introduction of new enemy types in the sequels. 

A separate DLC campaign shows the Ringmaker Celebrimbor's failed attempt to conquer Mordor with the One True Ring, which he uses to rally an ancient army of Orcs to campaign against Sauron. 

#### *Middle-earth: Shadow of War*
The  (2017) sequel expands on almost every mechanic from the , including the Nemesis system, and the interaction and complexity of the Orcs. 

The Orcs are now divided into several distinct tribes with their own unique tactics and weaponry. These include the the Mystic tribe uses black magic and necromancy, the Dark tribe focuses on stealth and ambush, the Feral tribe has mastered hunting and the domestication of Mordor's fiercest animals, the Maurader Tribe live for plunder and loot, the Machine tribe have mastered Mordor's burgeoning industry, the Warmonger tribe revere warfare itself, the Terror tribe are obsessed with both causing and receiving pain, and with the DLC there are also the Slaughter tribe that butcher their enemies and consume the meat, and the Outlaw tribe that pursue a policy of Mordor for the Orcs, shunning both the Dark and Bright Lords. The Half-Troll Olog-Hai are also introduced, many of whom speak either in Black-Speech or a heavy accent.

Orcs feature an expanded number of interactions, including the raiding of supplies of rival orcs, or leading them into ambushes, feats of strength against the Mordor wildlife or fights to the death in fighting pits to prove their worth, and the execution of rivals. Many of these interactions can be taken advantage of by the player character. They also feature an expanded set of personality traits- the player character has the ability to recruit a bodyguard amongst the Orcs who may nobly save the player, or in fact double-cross them. Some Orcs form friendships and alliances so strong with one another they become blood-brothers, refusing to come into conflict and vowing revenge on their blood-brothers killer. Orcs may continue to survive grievous battle wounds from their natural resistance, or Orcish medicine, but necromancy adds an additional complication, with some Orcs practicing necromantic arts. Certain Orcs are iron-willed refusing domination, while others are more likely to retreat upon losing a battle. In addition to domination, the player may also shame defeated Orcs, inflicting mental anguish on them as a punishment or to lower their level for subsequent fights. This has a chance to mentally break an enemy, while they may stay a dangerous combatant they are reduced to gibbering nonsense. Others however may gain the unashamed trait becoming impossible to further shame. Orcish relations are important to manage, as failing to appreciate them can easily lead to mutiny's and double-crosses from dominated Orcs. 

In a key story beat- the Orc ally of convenience of the prior game, Ratbag, is portrayed as having a strong friendship with an Olog-Hai he names Ranger in honor of Talion. Ranger himself detests Ratbag, speaking only in Black Speech, but he allied with Ratbag sensing his strong survival instincts. When Ranger is captured by Bruz, a traitor in the Bright-Lord's army, Ratbag becomes uncharacteristically determined to find and save Ranger. When they ultimately rescue them, the subsequent shaming of Bruz is so brutal that it shocks even someone as low as Ratbag, and both he and Ranger quietly leave the Bright Lords service in response. 

An additional rank in the Orcish Hierarchy is introduced with the Overlords- Orcs that command numerous war-chiefs from a Stronghold that governs a region of Mordor. These Overlords will rally their forces with speeches in the event of a siege or assault, but wait at the center of their stronghold to face the Bright Lord with their bodyguards, followers, and a customized defensive environment.

## Trivia
- Considering how much J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium influenced countless fantasy works after it, there's no doubt the Orcs he invented became the basis for their countless iterations in other fantasy works such as games like *Dungeons & Dragons*, *World of Warcraft*, and *The Elder Scrolls*, ''Dragon's Dogma Online*, *Dungeon Keeper*, as well as anime/light novel/manga *Sword Art Online*, *That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime*, *Delicious in Dungeon'', and many more. Though such portrayals tend to emphasize their barbaric lifestyle, Orcs in such works are, sometimes, more than often a naturally occurring race (not descended from members of pre-existing ones corrupted and disfigured by evil like suggested by Tolkien's original versions), and even displayed better capacity to choose between good and evil.
