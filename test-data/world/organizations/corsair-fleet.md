# Corsair fleet

The Corsairs of Umbar operated a vast military **fleet of ships**, sometimes referred to as the **black ships** or **black fleet**. The Corsairs likely were its makers.

## History
It is untold when the fleet was first formed. It may have been as early as the end of the Kin-strife, or before.

It is known that the Corsair fleet was comprised of [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dromon dromunds] as well as ships with deep hulls and many oars. The fleet sailed under red and black sails that were adorned by a black eye or a black star.

In year 2758 of the Third Age, the Corsairs of Umbar would launch three great black fleets. Raiding and invading the lands of Gondor along the coast - traveling as far north as the mouth of Isen.

In the year 2980, the Corsair fleet suffered a major blow from Thorongil, led his small fleet in a surprise attack on the Havens of Umbar. In the battle upon the quays, many of the black fleet’s ships were destroyed while at anchor and the Captain of the Haven was killed. With this attack, the Corsairs would never be able to launch more than one fleet again.

During the War of the Ring, the Corsair fleet, comprising of fifty great ships and smaller vessels beyond count, raided the lands of Lebennin, capturing Pelargir.

In the third film of Peter Jackson's film trilogy, the Corsair fleet is referred to as the **Black Ships**. They resemble a fusion of European and Chinese pirate ships made of wood and metal, armed with ballistae. The Black Ships appear in a scene in the extended edition when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli send the Army of the Dead to attack the frightened Corsairs and conquer the ships.

### Video games

In the campaign of Electronic Arts' *The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II*, the Corsairs, in Campaign Mode, join forces with the Goblins led by Gorkil and launch an assault upon the Grey Havens. While the attack fails in the Good Campaign, in the Evil Campaign the conjoined attack is completely successful, and thanks to the Black Ships of the Corsairs the Grey Havens are destroyed. Also, the special unit recruitable at captured Inns for the Goblins is the corsairs.
