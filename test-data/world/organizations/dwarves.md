# Dwarves

__FORCETOC__

**Dwarves** were a race of Middle-earth also known as the **Khazâd **(in their own tongue) or **Casari**, **Naugrim**, meaning "**Stunted People**", and **Gonnhirrim**, the "**Masters of Stone**". They are the oldest of the Free Peoples of the World.

## History
### Origin
The Dwarves were made by Aulë, whom they themselves called *Mahal*, meaning “maker.” Aulë wished above all for the Children of Ilúvatar to awaken so that he could love and teach them. But he was impatient, and in his impatience he chose to craft the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret, in a hall under the mountains of Middle-earth. He made them similar in aspect to himself, and furnished them with tremendous strength of will and spirit so as to resist the predations of Melkor's monsters. 

It was however, not within Aulë's power or authority to create life. As such the Seven Fathers were not truly alive, and were animated only when Aulë's thought was upon them. But for Aulë this was enough, and he began to teach them his crafts. Ilúvatar quickly came to know of the Dwarves' existence, and asked Aulë why he had overstepped his authority. Aulë, chastened, explained his desire for students to love and teach, but acknowledged his impatience and presumption. Weeping, Aulë prepared to destroy his creations. But Ilúvatar intervened, understanding the purity and innocence of Aulë's desire. In that moment, he granted the Dwarves true, independent life in the manner of the other Children, so that when Aulë picked up his great hammer to smite the Seven Fathers, they cowered in fear and begged for mercy. Ilúvatar adopted the Dwarves as his own, and Aulë was overjoyed. However, Ilúvatar did not wish to reward Aulë's impatience, nor to disrupt the overall sequence of the arrival of the Children. He decreed therefore that the Seven Fathers should sleep underground, and come forth after the Firstborn had awakened. To this Aulë gladly consented, and placed the Seven Fathers into a deep slumber to await the arrival of the Elves. Subsequently, Gimli went on many undocumented travels with his friend Legolas. In FO 120, Gimli and Legolas boarded a ship that sailed down the river Anduin, and then sailed to Valinor. Gimli was thus the only Dwarf to ever be permitted to cross to the Undying Lands.

Durin VII (the Last), retook Moria and brought Khazad-dûm back to its original splendor, and the Longbeards lived there till the "world grew old and the days of Durin's race ended." 

## Culture
### Appearance

When Aulë created the Dwarves, he had only a vague conception of what the Children of Ilúvatar should look like. Because of the threat of Morgoth over the world, Aulë made them very strong in body and character.

Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than hobbits, but much broader and heavier. Most had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and in some cases forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts.

Dwarves' armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that, in some cases, were "hideous" to look upon.

Dwarven women were alike in manner, voice and appearance to their menfolk. They were few in number, less than a third of all dwarf-kind, and they were seldom seen outside their own halls, often not venturing far due to their duties as caretakers and crafters in Dwarven society. They typically only travelled when in great need, and they usually dressed similarly to Dwarf men. This often led other folk to believe there were no women among the Dwarves, that Dwarves grew from stone when created. Few female Dwarven warriors were known, but some tales say that female Dwarves were as fierce as their male counterparts, especially in protecting their families and offspring. Dwarves were usually monogamous, and fewer than one-third of Dwarven men took a wife, the rest busying themselves with their crafts.

### Physiology

Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone.

Dwarves lived longer than Men,

One stronghold, Erebor (located in the Lonely Mountain), gained its wealth from precious gems hewn from rock and in "great seams of gold running like rivers through stone."

A name for where the Dwarves' were located was Phurunargian, which meant Dwarf-delving in the Common Tongue.

### Weapons and Armor

Dwarven soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because it can be used as a tool or a weapon, but in addition to axes they used hatchets, mattocks, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionally there is mention of Dwarven archers.

As for armor, Dwarves favored chain-mail and other metallic armor — the most expensive and precious of which was ring mail made of mithril. A vest of mithril was given to Bilbo Baggins by Thorin before the Battle of the Five Armies. He wore it during the battle and it later protected his nephew Frodo throughout his quest.) Gandalf said that this small coat was worth more than the whole of the Shire combined.

### Language and writing system

#### Language
The Dwarven language was created by Aulë when he created the Dwarves themselves, and called it *Khuzdûl*, which simply meant 'Dwarvish'. The language was harsh sounding, and was strange to other peoples' ears. Only Dwarves were permitted to learn any of its words, for it was guarded jealously. When around other races, the Dwarves seldom spoke in it.

In the First Age, when Dwarves first made contact with Elves, the only tongue in Beleriand would have been Sindarin, as the Ñoldor had not yet returned from Aman. Consequentially, Sindarin was spoken by the Dwarves. In fact, they were so impressed by the Elvish runes (the Cirth, made by Daeron) for writing Sindarin that they adopted them for use in writing Khuzdul, and used them forever more.

#### Writing system
The Dwarves devised Angerthas, a rune-system based on Cirth. There were different variations of Angerthas, varying by each Dwarven clan; the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm had their own variation with a number of unsystematic changes. The Dwarves of Erebor also used a further modification of the system, which was known as the mode of Erebor. This mode was notably exemplified in the Book of Mazarbul.

Some examples of Angerthas were seen in notable Dwarven texts, including the Book of Mazarbul, Thror's Map, as well as other objects such as the Key to the Side-door.

### Music
Many songs were sung in the halls of the Dwarves. One very notable song was "Far over the Misty Mountains Cold", also known as the "Song of the Lonely Mountain," and commonly referred by fans as the "Dwarf Song." Another song sung in Dwarven culture was *In Moria, in Khazad-dûm!*, which told of the history of Khazad-dûm (Moria) and honored Durin, first King of Durin's Folk. However, in times of war, Dwarves often refused to ally themselves with Elves or Men, choosing to remain neutral or oblivious to the clashes between good and evil. During the early parts of the Third Age, it is known that in some places wicked Dwarves had made alliances with the goblins and Orcs. It is suggested by J.R.R. Tolkien in some of his notes that the Dwarves that turned to wickedness most likely came from the far eastern mansions, and came under the Shadow of Morgoth and finally turned to evil. It is however unclear if these refer to Dwarves beyond the Iron Hills (the most eastern known stronghold of the Dwarves) Because Dwarves were not evil by nature, few ever served the Enemy of their own free will.
