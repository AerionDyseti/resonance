# Morgoth's army

'''Morgoth's army''' was made up of many dark creatures. Morgoth used it to make war on the Elves and Edain (Men) of Beleriand in the First Age. His high-ranking officers were the fallen Maiar Gothmog and Sauron. Morgoth's main warriors were Orcs, which comprised the bulk of the army. At one stage they were so numerous they spread across the whole of Anfauglith. Werewolves were occasionally used as mounts. Gothmog led a grand portion of this army at times, and later Sauron.

The army consisted of:
- Orcs
- Trolls
- Dragons
- Balrogs
- Spiders
- Vampires
- Werewolves
- Easterlings ("Swarthy Men")
- Things of Morgoth
