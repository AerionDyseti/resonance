# Great Eagles

The **Great Eagles** were beings of Arda said to have been "devised" by Manwë Súlimo, leader of the Valar, and were often called the **Eagles of Manwë**. They were sent from Valinor to Middle-earth to keep an eye on the exiled Ñoldor, and also upon their foe the evil Vala Morgoth, and later upon Sauron.

## History

### First Age
The Great Eagles were the messengers and spies of Manwë, and possessed the ability to see through all physical matter, except for the blackness of Morgoth's evil pits. Morgoth first discovered the limits of their sight prior to the fall of the great stronghold of Utumno.

For a time, the King of the Eagles, Thorondor, kept his eyries at the top of Thangorodrim, the three mighty peaks that Morgoth raised from the Iron Mountains above the gates of Angband. While they lived there, Thorondor helped Fingon rescue Maedhros from one of the sides of Thangorodrim. Thorondor's folk later removed their eyries to the Crissaegrim, part of the Echoriad encircling the secret location of Gondolin. There they were friends of King Turgon, and kept any spies away from the mountains.

Thorondor wounded Morgoth in the face immediately after Morgoth's duel with Fingolfin in the Dagor Bragollach, and carried Fingolfin's corpse to the Echoriad, where Turgon would bury him.

The Great Eagles fought alongside the host of Elves, the Valar, and Edain in the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, intervening decisively with Eärendil in a fight with Ancalagon.

### Second Age
In the Second Age, a pair of Eagles had an eyrie in the King's House in Armenelos, the capital of Númenor, until the reign of Tar-Ancalimon when the Kings became hostile to the Valar. The Eagles also watched the peak of Mount Meneltarma, and three Eagles would always appear when someone climbed to the summit and during the festivals of Erukyermë, Eruhantalë, and Erulaitalë.

Towards the end of Númenor, the Valar sent storm clouds in the shape of Great Eagles in an attempt to warn the Númenóreans of their folly and impending punishment.

### Third Age
In the Third Age, many Great Eagles lived at eyries in the North, the most important one being the Great Shelf, to the east of the Misty Mountains in Wilderland. These Eagles helped the Elves of Rivendell and Radagast in watching the land and gathering any news of Orcs.

In TA 2941, the Lord of the Eagles at the time with a company of Great Eagles rescued Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo Baggins, and Thorin Oakenshield and thirteen fellow dwarves from Northern Orcs and Wargs, bringing them to the Great Shelf for a night and a day. Weeks later, a number of these Eagles flew to Erebor, joining the Battle of Five Armies that had erupted, and assisting in the defeat of Orcs and Wargs. The Lord of the Eagles thereafter became "King of All Birds".

In TA 3018, during the War of the Ring, Gwaihir rescued Gandalf the Grey from the top of Orthanc in Isengard—having been dispatched by Radagast—and again, in the following year, from Zirakzigil high above Moria after Gandalf's duel with the Balrog.

## Names
Elvish words for the Eagles were Sindarin *thoron* or *thorn* and Quenya *soron*.

## Background

Tolkien's painting of an eagle on a crag appears in some editions of *The Hobbit*. According to Christopher Tolkien, the author based this picture on a painting by Archibald Thorburn of an immature Golden Eagle, which Christopher found for him in *The Birds of the British Isles* by T. A. Coward. However, Tolkien's use of this model does not necessarily mean that his birds were ordinary Golden Eagles.

## Other versions
In earlier texts, Tolkien had envisioned the Great Eagles as bird-shaped Maiar. However, he had remembered that he abandoned the concept of the Children of the Valar, and that Gwaihir and Landroval were descendants of Thorondor during the events of . Eventually, Tolkien decided that the Great Eagles were animals that had been "Taught language by the Valar and raised to a higher level — but they still had no *fëar*".

## In adaptations

### In Peter Jackson's films
In Peter Jackson's  and  film trilogies, the Eagles are smaller than they are in the book. They have been noted to be around 6m (20ft) tall, with a wingspan of no more than 23m (75ft). Also, in the film adaptations the birds are not shown to speak. 

In , after Thorin and Company are cornered by Azog and his Orc pack after their escape from Goblin-town in the Misty Mountains, they fend off Azog and his followers by starting a fire, but Thorin confronts Azog and is defeated and wounded, but Bilbo and the others defend him by fighting against the Orcs and Wargs until eventually they are rescued by the Eagles, who also take out some of Azog's pet Wargs, much to his fury. They carry Thorin and Company throughout the lands, landing them on the Carrock before departing.

During the titular events of , the Eagles carry Radagast and Beorn into battle against Azog's army; otherwise, their role in the films is identical to that of the books, though the Eagle that carries Gandalf from Orthanc is summoned by Gandalf and not sent by Radagast.

### In *The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim*
In , a white and grey Great Eagle was encountered by Helm's daughter (named Hèra in the film) who attempted to communicate with it with accounts pertaining its kind as her sole guidance. Her attempts were unsuccessful until near the end of the conflict between her people and Wulf's army; locating its shelter at the top of the mountain near what would be known as Helm's Deep, she humbly pleaded for its assistance in dealing the crisis at hand. The white and grey Great Eagle relented and proceeded to carry Helm Hammerhand's set of armour to Fréaláf Hildeson both for him to wear and to inform him of her and their people's situation. The same Great Eagle would made its presence known to Wulf as it revealed the arrival of Fréaláf — clad in Helm's armour — and his soldiers to Hèra and her people's rescue.

### In *The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power*
In , the Eagles are shown to be of similar size as in the film trilogies.

### In video games
- In , an eagle named Beleram acts as a supporting character, aiding the players in battle by attacking enemies like Trolls and Uruk-hai.
- In , the eagles act as a transportation form that carry the player(s) all over Middle-earth. The eagles appear in the same scenes as they did in the first two films.
- In , the Elven faction may summon one Great Eagle with the "Eagle's Nest" upgrade to their fortress.
