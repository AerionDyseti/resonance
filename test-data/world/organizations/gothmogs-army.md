# Gothmog's army

An **army commanded by Gothmog** was responsible for the destruction of the hidden Elven city of Gondolin, and for most of the victories of Morgoth in the First Age.

## History

This army was assembled in FA 510 after Maeglin's betrayal under the leadership of Gothmog. The army appeared to be the most advanced in technology compared to the rest of the *Glamhoth*. It was made up of Orcs, Trolls, Werewolves, Dragons, and Balrogs. They surrounded the city of Gondolin and besieged it killing nearly all in an immense battle, save for the few that followed Tuor and Idril. Gothmog, however, was slain in this conflict by Ecthelion of the Fountain.

## Weaponcraft
In older versions of the legendarium, they used iron machines fueled by "internal fire" as personnel carriers and to destroy fortifications.
