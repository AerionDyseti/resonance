# Kaukareldar

**Kaukareldar**, also called **false-fairies**

## History
After the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Melko created Kaukareldar in the image of Men and Elves in order to deceive and betray Men so that both races would be too busy spying on each other to unite against him.

Not long after, a group of Kaukareldar

## Etymology
In his commentary, Christopher Tolkien remarks that the Gnomish Lexicon defines a *Gong* as "one of a tribe of the Orcs, a goblin", but notes that *Gongs* might just be another name for *Kaukareldar*, an early Quenya word under the root *KAWA* ("stoop") which has five derivations: *kauka* ("crooked, bent, humped"), *kauko* ("humpback"), *kawin* ("I bow"), *kaurë* ("fear"), and *kaurëa* ("timid"). In the Quenya Lexicon, *Eldar*, the second element of *Kaukareldar*, is defined as "a beach-fay or Solosimpë".

The Gnomish Lexicon reportedly compares the word *Gongs* to *sithagong* ("dragonfly") derived from *sitha* ("fly") and *Gong*.
